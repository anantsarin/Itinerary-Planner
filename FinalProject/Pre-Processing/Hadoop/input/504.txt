This isn't even a square... more of an indoor strip mall, but with just a few shops.  There was this cute cawfee shop that I frequented here (Bean Bag Cafe?) on my way to the post office.  There are dental offices here too.  This place is aight.  I believe they have recently installed a Starbucks here about 3 years ago.  I had to give this place 3 stars because we truly had limited options in Syracuse, and this was one of the most useful locations in that small college town.
