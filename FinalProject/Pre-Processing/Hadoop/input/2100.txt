Heard they had a new chef, and finally got to check him out. They still have the old "classic" menu, but have a whole new repertoire of pretty darn amazing apps and entrees. We had the lightly breaded and fried artichokes with a superb aioli dipping sauce, and the flatbread, also excellent. I had the meatloaf with puréed sweet potatoes and sautéed shallots in "natural" gravy: truly amazing and just$10. Worth it at twice the price. Wife had the stuffed trout and son got the rigatoni, both superb. Didn't get to try a dessert but they looked good. Conclusion: big city eating for cheap in the same atmosphere as it's always had.

Lunch today was nothing short of a good tîme with excellent food. what more can you ask for?   well no you cant see the lake. but also no you wont have to empty your wallet for unremarkable sandwiches. we had an egg salad and a chicken salad sandwich. both were made with obvious care and were truly delicious. and these folks apparently know the art of soup. the chicken veg was popping with flavor and the green bean chowder was as tasty as it was surprising. beer selection very good. our server was just the right amount of sassy / funny. we felt good being there and will return next time in town. Cheers.

This is a classic western NY local spot. Old, traditional,friendly, basic fare. But it has "dive charm", and is just plain nice. Eat in the bar for the best vibe. Good wings, beef on wick, Reuben's, wraps, excellent home made soups and decadent deserts. One of the few Bemus spots that is open all year. Lunch ends at 2 but they have wings, burgers and things available all day bar menu. Dinner starts ou at 5.

Had a fun time at see zhur, good food, affordable & super friendly fun staff. Best place to eat casual in Bemus. I ordered a shocktop beer in bottle, and joking asked for a slice of orange. They didn't have any orange slices so they went next store to the grocery market, bought an orange, and sliced it, see the photo. Party of six, served fast, & well taken care of by Jill. Also cool hair color by other waitress!

The See-Zurh (some times called Shaggy's) is hands down the best restaurant in Bemis Point, New York. It's a super casual no frills place that a lot of people go to for a drink at the bar, but it has a complete menu along with daily specials, top notch service and, over all, it's just a fun place be at. The crowd consists of both locals and tourists, but most of the tourists go to over priced places with far worse food and horrid service like the Italian Fisherman because it is located on the water (Lake Chautauqua). I've been to the See-Zurh countless times over the last several decades and have never been disappointed. They have excellent burgers and their aged rib eye steak is superb. Best of all, the food and the drinks are reasonably priced.

This place was good for dinner. Had beef on wheck & wife had burger with green beans; food was great! Enjoy Shocktop & Yuengling on tap. The service is excellent; they kept my beer topped off and always asked if we were ok.

Had dinner the other night, party of six in the dining room. I had a shrimp cocktail that was way past it's prime. They were kind of limp, a little shriveled, and very tough. I really hate sending anything back, but they were inedible and I had ordered it for my meal. The waitress was rude and insulting about it, never appologized for the quality, and embarrassed me in front of my party. My partner also mentioned her rudeness later. Everyone else had prime rib, but they all said their dinners were just OK. We are regulars there, but usually eat in the bar area. Desserts are really good. We will be back, but will not eat in the dining room again.
