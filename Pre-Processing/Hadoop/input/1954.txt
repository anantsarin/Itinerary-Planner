Not sure if it was just luck or what but it was great. Very clean and friendly staff. My kids had a blast and that was all that mattered.

We arrived at 5:20 pm on a Saturday night. There were lots of people even outside filling out the consent form. The line inside was not too bad and we got the form to fill out before we got to the desk. However we still had to wait for an hour and a half until 7 PM before our three-year-old could play. Once we got our turn, there were still too many other children for my taste. Our 3 year old eventually got upset when she was climbing on the side and the worker told her directly that she shouldn't do it instead of telling us. She was very upset and didn't want to play anymore after that. Overall, way too crowded. We may try again some early morning, but not really excited about it. For the toddler area, there was a limit of 15 children. This was too many in my opinion. You can call ahead to reserve a time, but you still have to share the area.

Took the kids there for a birthday party this past Sunday and had a great time. The place has a very small arcade type section if they get tired of bouncing.(but what kid really gets tired of bouncing) ..... even my 13 year old had a good time. I would definitely go back there to let my kids wear 9 some extra energy.

We took our first trip to Bounce today and it was not a good experience. They wanted to charge me for a full hour even though my 3 year old would have only been able to play for 30 minutes because they had a birthday party coming in. I don't think that is right!  I called to make a reservation and told them I woild have 3 older kids and a 3 year old and they didn't mention it!  While I did not make the reservation because I wanted to pay in cash when I got there all they said was there was not many reservations so it wouldn't be a problem. Thanks for wasting my time!  I think it would be better if they changed by the half hour anyways.

I called Friday night to make reservations for Saturday morning. Checking in was fine. I have a 16 month old and 6 year old. I took the baby to Bounce Jr and my sister took my 6yo to regular bounce. My daughter and I sat in the foam pit area most of the time. We stayed to a corner bc the older (4-5) kids were acting crazy and jumping all over not paying attention, neither were there parents. They were gonna rush my daughter. They shouldve been told to calm down or atleast to stay to one side bc there's babies around. One of the 'ref's Pete S was really good with the younger kids tho. My son went to play dodgeball, my sister wasnt allowed to play. And my son was playing with kids a little older. They were mean and gained up on him. The ref shoudlve stopped that. He kept getting frustrates bc my son kept getting out but thats what happens and plus my son has never played dodgeball before so he was learning. Some staff (besides Pete and a couple others) were horrible! I dont think I  will go back. Not for those prices, and rude and mean staff. I won't have my children subjected to that behavior. Im paying money to be there, they are in customer service. They should be kissing my butt.
This place was very clean, nice and new however the size of the facility was too small for the amount of bouncers let in during the time frame. The $12 an hour fee is crazy to me and I don't see that being a realistic amount once the newness wears off. I have one child I couldn't imagine paying for a couple kids that amount for an hour worth of play. Which brings me to my last complaint. My 7 year old had to wait in lines lasting 5-10 minutes to jump for 5 minutes so within her $12 an hour time slot she gets less than 1/2 hour. She also was the very next in line to go when the time slot was up after waiting for 10 minutes and the worker was going to turn her away. After I argued with him and was given an attitude he allowed her to jump for 3 minutes. Good luck with this, I hope you can figure out how to manage your busy times and improve customer service. We are the customer don't herd us around like cattle.

Very annoyed at the customer service at this place. I have been to other Bounce locations, and while they weren't anything like Rebounderz, the other Bounce franchises actually treat you like a paying customer. This one though- not really sure what the strategy is. I would think as a newly opened location they would be trying to win long-term customers. I called 4 times this Friday, trying to make a reservation (since the website says it is better to call and make one). I called around 12, then at 2, again at 3/4 then at 5. Every time I left a voice-mail (after getting transferred to one), in the message I left I explained that I would like to make a reservation for two, for today, anytime around or after 5. After calling 4 times, wasting my day, planning on getting in a good workout, I gave up.. So instead, my girlfriend and I went out to eat. After dinner, I decided to call again, this time I reached an actual person! I asked why I had not been called back yet today and the employee said they have been very busy. Okay? Pizzerias are very busy too, do they loose service from it? No. Bounce! in Poughkeepsie has to come up with a better way for making reservations. I go to the LI location a lot, and will continue. Unfortunately, I do not see myself wasting time (or a day) again trying to make a reservation with false hope of getting in, just to never receive a call back. The least that could have been done was to get called and asked if I would like to schedule for another time this weekend. I don't know.. very annoyed at this, I think the reservation system could be handled differently, if you are too busy to answer calls and make reservations, hire someone to work the phone to make appointments. On a closing note, don't send customers to a voice-mail saying you will call them back in the order the message was received, and then not call back! I called around 9pm and finally got an answer.. You are telling me between 12pm and 9pm you were too busy to schedule a reservation??
