Taco hut has excellent food & drinks. My personal favorite item is the chicken portabella wrap, and while their Mexican food items are not what I would consider "authentic" everyone who orders them seems to enjoy them. Having lived in areas where you could get true Mexican food it's not to my liking, but I never hesitate to accept an invitation to eat there. The queso appetizer is also DELICIOUS!

We thought this place would be a decent meal.  Wrong.  The food was gross.  Since when is cheese for chips at a Mexican restaurant cheddar?   Service was good and we were happy they were one of the few places actually open on a Monday night.

Another real good Jamestown staple restaurant. A lot of their food is very good but if you want to eat cheap and tasty, their tacos are where it's at. I would also highly recommend their chip buffet with bean dip, guacamole, and their salsa (which I think is homemade). Taco Huts sauce is also another incredible concoction. At various times I have also tried their fajitas which are also very tasty.

This was the worst mexican food i ever had.  9 bucks for a tray of chips and dip.  The nachos looked like something that would be served at a high school basket ball game.  Will never go back.

Awesome food! Been a long time customer of the Taco Hut. If you're in town visiting family or an out of town tourist, this is the place for fast, cheap and delicious Mexican food. Though the catering service is highly unreliable, the dinner menu is great.

Well, the place is nice! Friendly staff. The prices are right, and the name of the food as well! The black beans deep was good. The rice was not great, too spicy, the tex-mex cuisine uses rice with Anato to help smooth the spicy foods, the rice is very spicy, and the refried beans has no flavor, so go with the black beans instead. Overall I give this place 3 stars: friendly service, cleanliness and prices!

I love Taco Hut. There are not very many taco places in this area, which has made me really sad, due to my great love of tacos. Most places around here serve bland, boring Mexicanesque food, which often gives me stomach-ache. Not Taco Hut. It might not be quite as good as Cactus or Los Burritos in Los Angeles, CA, but for an area nearly as far from the border as you can get in this country, their food is pretty darn good. I admit, I often do leave with a belly ache, but only because of how hard it is to stop eating. Occasionally items are left off my order, usually due to our amazing waitress missing an item, as she never writes any of our gargantuan orders down, but it is rarely an issue (except that once they forgot an entire section of our takeout order, for which one of our party had to drive back all the way into town to retrieve it. this was rectified with a free meal at a later date, however) All around, fabulous.
One has to realize that this restaurant serves really bad Mexican food. However it's good enough to eat. I don't understand how they can serve refried beans from a can, lukewarm to taste, swimming in a frightening mystery red sauce, which could have meat in it or not. I've never heard of a Mexican restaurant that seriously flirted with the concept of a hot meat sauce until this place. This seems to be "As Good as it gets" for upstate New York. This place gets 4 stars, but only relatively speaking. Recently, I was driving across the country. This town was a convenient stop off the freeway after 6.5 hours of driving. And despite my horror at what passes for "adventurous authentic" Mexican, I was glad to find a place with a big menu, vegetarian options, and good hours. Beggars can't be choosers when traveling through places like this.

Ok, so the food isn't on par with with Southern California or Texas, but take into consideration that this is not a region known for Mexican food. Taco Hut tries very hard. Their food is not bad. Their service is friendly and accommodating. It's well managed and well laid out. The entire place, including the bathrooms, is as clean as a whistle. Decent beers on tap. Comfortable bar to sit and dine at. Appeared to be very family friendly. I would not hesitate for one minute to return the next time I'm in the area.

Back story: I grew up a couple miles from this place and at that time it was one of the only places where my (single) mom and I could afford to eat with regularity because it  was and still is, relatively, cheap for what you get. I remember at 15 or so smoking a clove cigarette with my girlfriends in the front room and seeing if we could get away with it! (We did -- but the servers rolled their eyes at us. And, you could smoke inside in those days, and that seemed okay to us!) I digress. Now, I'm a longtime vegetarian but I wasn't then. Still..for me it was, is and always will be about the BEANS. The pinto beans, that is. Get the bean dip and chips and see what I mean. The recipe is simply perfect, and I remember once asking a server for the secret and she told me a list of about five or six basic ingredients. Try as I may to replicate them, I cannot! I no longer live in the area, haven't for 25 years. But after all of this time, whenever I go back to Chautauqua County, I always plan it around T.H., My high school friends and family KNOW this. If you're going to meet, it's going to likely be right here!! What more do you need? So, here's what I get: Maybe chips and salsa/guac/a or the aforementioned bean dip-- if hungry! The nachos grande are really wonderful, perfect, also! The Burrito Platter with pinto beans and cheese and the red (enchilada) sauce, not the meat sauce, though I recall the meat sauce was good, too. Maybe a margarita! Maybe a pint of Southern Tier on tap! (Warning: if you go for the large beer and you're not a large person, you may need a designated driver!) Love it here! Some of the servers have been here since "the day", and service can be a bit salty but also very sweet and yes, they've expanded to next door but haven't changed that carpet OR the classic rock playlist...THANK GOODNESS! Yes, J-town looks worse and also better at the very same time. But just like Ms. Cheryl Crowe sang it back then, "This is home."

The Taco Hut has been around for ages and is now somewhat of a local institution. The tacos do have a Mexican flavor but having been thoroughly Americanized, far from being real Mexican. However, it's neat, has a nice décor and can just be a fun relaxing place. For those that know the history of the place, the details which I won't divulge on here, I'm one of the original "I bared my butt for the Taco Hut" victims.

Every once in a while, I just have to have something Mexican, and when the fit took me during my vacation, I decided to take my sweetie to Taco Hut. (We had tried before, but that was on a Sunday and they were closed.) I should say that my sweetie CANNOT handle spice, so our server must have thought that we were a bit weird coming into a Mexican restaurant, and asking what they had that wasn't spicy. That's kind of like going to a barbecue place, and asking what they have that's vegetarian, but our server was friendly and helpful, and my sweetie managed to find something she enjoyed that didn't cause her any distress. Me, I was having a blast. I wanted to order half the menu, but managed to control myself. Mostly. Yeah, sure, so it's not exactly authentic Mexican, but it was definitely a cut above what I expected with a name like that. (I was thinking that it would be something along the lines of Taco Bell or Taco Time, but it was a good deal better than that.) Apparently, it has a loyal clientele, because they sell T-shirts. I passed on that. It was good, but not great.

I love it when my co-workers order too many hard shells and share their Taco Hut tacos with me! Taco Hut is a downtown Jamestown staple. It more than suffices when you get a craving for Mexican in the middle of the week or are in a pinch and need a quick, quality meal in downtown. More than just that though: Margaritas! Dos Equis on draft! And some Southern Tier too!

the food was not awesome but it was good. the meat sauce is nice. the place was very dark and the floor was a mess. looked like it had not been vacuumed since Lucy was in show biz. the prices were good and the service was speedy. i had the mexican revolution and it really wasn't much of a revolution. it was beef in a soft shell with meat sauce and a side of beans and rice. so over all the price was right but the location was dark and dirty. the service was ok but the food was nothing special. not to sure i would hurry back.

Hit up this place after a show in Jamestown. Not bad. The service was excellent; very friendly. We started with some chips and guacamole. The gauc had some spice to it that I couldn't put my finger on but it was quite yummy. I ordered the chicken chimichanga which was very good. It came served with rice and beans. The rice was too spicy for my taste but my friend enjoyed it. The beans were kind of dry and thick (like from a can) but it was the end of the night so maybe they had been sitting around. Still, I'd def be back if I was in the area again. The bar area looked fun.

was my second choice of a place to eat, shrimp tacos were ok, shrimp enchilada was the better choice, as a fish eating vegetarian my choices were limited but the taste of the two dishes were good

So after spending a long day of driving through hail to arrive in Chautauqua County, my coworker and I were more than ready to get some dinner. Thrilled that she had recently joined me in a vegetarian lifestyle, I couldn't wait to find a great veggie restaurant.  I'm not sure whether I was more shocked or disappointed when I started calling local restaurants to ask about vegetarian options and was quoted things such as, fish n chips, steak, chicken wings, tilapia, veal and for the "real strict vegetarian" a baked potato. WTF?! Then I stumbled on Taco Hut and figured, you can almost always vegetarianize (yes I did just make that into a verb) anything on a Mexican menu, so we took our chances and headed over. From the outside it looks very fast food like, and I was skeptical that we were going to end up looking at a "taco bell twin" menu, but my fears proved to be unwarranted. Although I would not recommend the place for someone looking for a fancy, gourmet, truly authentic mexican cuisine,  I would recommend it if you're looking for cheap, filling, standard tex-mex fare.  I got a burrito with beans, cheese, lettuce, tomato and onions for 5.49, and the thing was pretty massive.  You do have to pay extra if you want chips and salsa, but they're still on the cheap side. Additionally, the place was clean, the service was quick and the waitstaff was incredibly friendly. Not to mention, for the "real strict vegetarians", they've got more to offer than just a baked potato. . .

So, let me start by saying ... I knew that having Mexican food outside the texas state border is often an iffy thing to do.  Unless you are in New Mexico or Arizona, or even Caifornia ... Mexican food can be a bit tricky to get right.  I mean seriously, I'm even putting aside the obvious differences in Mexican food between the states I listed.  I can appreciate thise differences.  So, going in, my expectations were not high at all ... but I was willing to give it a go.    But alas, my niece and I went here because 1) it was close to the Reg Lenna Civic Center where we were going to a show and 2) well, it was about the only decent restaurant available in the immediate area.   So, there was a small wait.  No big deal.  It was expected.  We were seated to a table that was wet.  ugh.  This is one of those things I hate the most.  That wet rag that was dragged around your table to'clean' it.  It just icks me thinking about it.  So, I use my napkin to dry the table off.   OK, fine.   When the waitress comes, we order our drinks and I ask for another napkin and we order the chips and salsa as an appetizer.  the napkin finally came during the actual meal.   Food review.  OMG.   This is why this place gets 1 star.   the chips and salsa ... you get chips and your choice of 3 'dips'.  We chose guac, salsa, and queso (white).  When it arrives, it is a nice presentation ... chips on the bottom with a 2nd story of the 3 little ramekins of our dips.  the chips were OK ... not warm and with no seasoning on them.  the salsas were as follows:   1) Guac - this seriously tasted like it came out of one of those prepackaged guac things.  It was creamy to the point of you know it wasn't real.  It was tasteless as well.  2) Queso ... it was white which I'm down with but ti was not entirely melted.  It had a big blob in the middle of it that was not melted.  and 3) salsa.  Now, to say this was salsa was a stretch of anyone's imagination.  No way Jose'.  It was a bunch of cut tomatoes.  there was no sign of cilantro.  There was 1 sliver of a jalapeno pepper.  No onions.  I swear, it was just tomatoes.  No flavor (no lime juice etc).   So, not impressed at all.   For dinner I had the Mexican revolution which is bascially your 2 enchiladas (your way), rice and beans.  I thought this would be safe.  When it arrived, there really wasn't a sauce on the enchiladas, I mean it was some kinda carne sauce but it wasn't saucey and it looked like meat crumbled with cheese melted on it.  I had ordered beef enchiladas.  And then ... the enchiladas were separated (no joke) from the rice and beans by way of a broken taco shell in half ... it was a taco shell wall.  Seriously.  It was!  The rice was very red rice.  I'm not big with red rice ... it was OK but not that great.  The beans ... were dry and flavorless.  They were refried.  Or out of a can.  It was hard to tell.  And the enchiladas.   I had to go to the emergency room after eating a bite of these ... omg, they were so salty.  I mean, seriously salty.   This theme continued into the ala carte taco I had ordered as well.   Ugh.   So, the cleanliness, the service, the food ... all make this a place I will not be finding my way back to again.  So, just beware.

5 Stars for the meat and cheese burritos! Best burritos I've had. Deep fried adds a nice crunch, but I think I like the flavor better when I get them plain. The rest of the menu's good, but the meat and cheese burritos are what I make the hour plus drive for!

This is one of the best local eats.  They offer a great variety with good prices and even offer take out.  We have been there many times and continue to go back.  Last time we got take out for 10 people and it only took 10 minutes!  Definitely recommend you try it!

If  you're from Texas, or have any sort of Latin heritage -- the place is kind of painful. but -- if you live in Jamestown you know it's slim pickins. If in the area, an absolute MUST. they have some amazing drinks, like the coconut margarita (oh. my. gosh) Their ground beef tacos are good, and I love their shrimp tacos. For an appetizer get the chip buffet. you get to select a few dipping sauces & the chips ALWAYS come out warm.

Excellent Tex Mex. The food is delicious and the ultimate comfort food is found in their homemade "chili" (savory meat sauce spooned over homemade refried beans and covered in melted cheese). The service is best on weekdays around lunchtime. But bearing with a slow server is a small price to pay for great food!

Ok food NOT Tex Mex!  Table salsa not as spicy as catsup. Salty refried beans. Portions for lunch special good size but a touch pricey for what you get
While visiting my girlfriend's hometown and she was out at work, I was left to fend for myself for my meals. She recommended a restaurant called cooper's but I quickly found that they had odd hours and I continued on my way down E 3rd street. I arrived at the taco hut and said hey, why not. So I went on in and I must say the food did not disappoint. I had quite possibly the best guacamole and chips I've ever had at any Mexican restaurant. The sampler platter with a burrito, taco, enchilada, rice, and beans was also very good. The rice was actually phenomenal. Only 3 things truly disappointed me. I had to pay to get chips and salsa which is complimentary at most restaurants. And the service. I went in to the restaurant alone and it truly seemed that I was inconveniencing them by taking up a table with just one person at it. I was rarely checked on, and it was quite obvious that they could have cared less whether or not I ate there again. Third, it was pricey. For just myself, it cost $19. Not cheap by any means in my book. So overall, awesome food, terrible servers, and over priced.
