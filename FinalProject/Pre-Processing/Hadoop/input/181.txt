Love this store for quick gifts and little treats for myself from rochester based artisans! The little poops filled with aromatherapy are a frequent buy! Everyone gets a kick!
A very cool little place with strange and unique prints, jewelry, and other little pieces of art. The people I met were incredibly friendly and seemed to adore the place, which is understandable! Art covers pretty much every surface; I feel like it would be hard not to find something visually appealing, and the prices all seemed reasonable for what they were selling.
A darling little shop with a lovely mission to support a collective of artists selling their locally made goods. I'm particularly excited to see the goat's milk soap from Chicory Farms (Bloomfield). I first bought one as a gift at the Brainery Bazaar and am so happy to know I can buy them whenever I need them. They are amazing gifts and there are scents galore like lemongrass, grapefruit, lavender among my faves. And, I mean those labels are the cutest... makes you not want to even use them, but you will because this soap is super moisture rich. Beyond that, you'll find a bunch of handmade cards, pottery, jewlery, and home decor items. It's amazing how much they pack into this small ~8x8 shop. Probably the best new local spot for unique, handmade gifts. It's like a craft fair open five days a week! A few of my fave items are the geometric jewelry from Erica Bello and The Knotty Owl, plus adorable cards from Sugar & Type.
