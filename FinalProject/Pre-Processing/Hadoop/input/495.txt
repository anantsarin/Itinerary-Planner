This is a vintage store with truly vintage items in a clean setting. Amazing. Two things that seems hard to come by when shopping for vintage clothes. The owner is friendly and the shop is inviting.
I really thought I would like this place. We walked in during a downpour and the guy behind the counter seemed more annoyed than anything that a customer was there. Sorry charlie, not going to happen
I like this store.  It sells vintage clothes that actually look clean and wearable.  Too many shops like this fall into the trap of looking like a salvation army, but then deciding to sell items for ten times the amount.  However, the selection of clothes at MPC is quite limited.  If you are a girl, they have some quality dresses buried within the racks and some nice accessories.  However, when shopping for myself I am only ale to choose from grungy flannels, tweed sports coats, and unwearable polos.  They have a selection of vintage t-shirts that I have picked from, but a lot are forgettable.  I wish the store would expand its purchases. The store is worth it to check out, and I hope you find something to buy because it's great to see shops like this in Syracuse, but it just doesn't offer anything for me.
