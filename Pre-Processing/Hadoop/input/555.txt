For my hair done by Amber the other day. She was so nice and really wanted my hair to be healthy and beautiful. I couldn't believe how soft my hair was when I left! And the color came out SO BEAUTIFUL. Definitely will make this my go to salon in Syracuse.
I love this salon because of Laurie.  Laurie is the best hair stylist.  Every time she cuts and colors my hair it turns out exactly the way I wanted it.  It's like Laurie can read my mind LOL.  I've been going to Laurie for years and I wouldn't go to anyone else!
