I went to Buttermilk Falls for a 3 night getaway and had the most relaxing time! The property is beautiful, and the food was really good. I wanted everything on the menu at Henrys so was happy I was staying a few days. The breakfast and afternoon tea included with the room was good too. The staff were super friendly, particularly at Henrys. The spa is great and I enjoyed my treatments. Slight drawback - there is only one toilet and one shower in the change rooms which got pretty hectic and crazy on Saturday (including having no toilet paper) so that was a little disappointing but overall my spa experience was really good. I stayed first in the Sage Right room which was lovely, and then moved to the Gindele Suite as I had a friend joining me. The Gindele Suite was fantastic - spacious and with gorgeous views over the duck pond. Generally the views around the property are really beautiful, and the farm is really picturesque and perfectly maintained. I would definitely recommend this for a very relaxing and peaceful getaway from the city either with friends, alone or with your partner. Thanks Buttermilk Falls for a thoroughly enjoyable long weekend.
We stayed at the River View house in late December, which is basically amazing. Gorgeous views of the river and the house itself is pretty luxurious and spacious. There is a My Cousin Vinny train situation here, to the tenth power. We were good sports about the non stop train traffic that is not only on the other side of the river, but also literally right underneath the house at the river bank. However, it could really get annoying if you are staying here for a long period of time. I seriously do not know where all these trains are going, and maybe it was just the time of year we were there, but I swear trains went by, blowing their horns of course, every 15 or 20 minutes, day and night. Investing in some sound proof windows would be a nice idea.
so every year i do something for my bday... and i wanted something peaceful and relaxing and by choosing this place i got even MORE! beautiful hotel and with  a unique  rooms ! the restaurant and the spa were amazing ! so worth the money thank you buttermilk!
I love this place, a girls day or weekend getaway! Staff are very friendly, restaurant excellent, spa amazing! You should come here if your looking for a great place to relax and just simply have a good time! Bottle of wine with cheese crackers goes just perfect with this trip too! :)
Went to Buttermilk Falls Inn for a 2 day weekend stay with my boyfriend for his birthday. We were pleased when the drive took exactly 2 hours from downtown Manhattan- considering we left at 5p on a Friday in the summer. We stayed in the main house in room 'Sage Left' which was just what we were looking for. It is located on the first floor, had a decent sized bathroom and a beautifully decorated bedroom. Very clean! The best part were the French doors leading to the back yard patio which had gorgeous views and a table in which we enjoyed our wine. We spent the weekend exploring the grounds by foot and bike. The made to order breakfast was delicious and the afternoon snack (fresh pizza) was also great. The eating area was equipped all day with water, coffee and tea (iced and hot) and other small snacks to get you through the day. All in all it was a great weekend and am glad I spent the extra money in staying at this wonderful bed and breakfast. Will absolutely return!
Our Girl's Spa Day at Buttermilk Falls Inn + Spa was an amazing experience. From the beginning they were very easy and courteous to work with. The staff was friendly and very helpful at every step. Parking on the grounds is free, which a plus since it was 1.5 hours away. When we arrived, we checked in to the spa's reception area for our service. Since we had some time, we decided to explore the picturesque grounds, including the cute farm. It started raining heavily, but they let us wait it out in the barn, which was set up for a wedding from the night before. Finally when it stopped raining we went to the falls, which were ok. Not the most amazing waterfall, but the hike to it was very fun, and there was a cute bench by it. Finally it was time to get ready for the messages. We changed into the robes provided for us and relaxed by the very well kept pool/sauna/steam room area until we were called. I had the signature 60 minute message. It was the first time I ever had one so I was a little nervous about it at first, but I had no reason to. The therapist was incredibly professional, nice, and made it a great experience. The message itself was very relaxing and they used great oils that made me feel so smooth afterwards. Overall, Buttermilk Falls Inn + Spa definitely deserves all 5 stars! It was an all around great day. The ONLY set back we experienced was that we didn't know that the lunch hour ended at 1:30. My message ended at 1:45 so when I went to order the kitchen was already closed. Keep that in mind if you want lunch and don't want to change out of your robe to go to the restaurant nearby.
This is our 3rd visit to Buttermilk and it is still as lovely an experience as ever.  We had hoped to catch peak leaf change; but, we didn't.  It doesn't matter.  The inn is beautifully run.  The llamas and other animal are so peaceful to visit.  There is beauty everywhere you look.We tried to book again next year but were unable to book the same room, which we MUST have for nostalgic reasons.  Wish we didn't have to wait a year to go back!
We had a lovely 2-night stay in the Maynor Flat. The room was beautiful-lots of light and a beautiful bathroom with a claw foot tub and shower with skylight. It was the perfect size space for me, my husband and 7 year old daughter. We especially enjoyed the breakfast every morning. It was a full spread of basics: fruit, cereal, bagels and yogurt plus specials made to order. My daughter had pancakes and french toast and gobbled up the eggs. We loved exploring the grounds with ducks and farm animals. Having Henry's nearby was also convenient for lunch and the food was also very good. All the staff was extremely  friendly. The only disappointment: no wifi in the room but we were able to use our wireless network on our phones. We'd definitely stay again!
We had the wedding of our dreams at Buttermilk Falls!  All aspects of the planning with Michael were handled with great care and attention.  I felt truly cared for even though we were a small wedding of 45 people which was usually met with disinterest when we contacted other venues.  From our first email interactions to the days before the wedding, Michael was quick to reply and took care of everything we needed.  When details did not go exactly as planned, Michael brought it to our attention quickly and gave us solutions.  The views at Buttermilk are exceptional and made for pictures and memories that will last forever.  The food was excellent, the ambience of the barn was beautiful, and the friendliness of the staff was appreciated by all of our guests.  We stayed in Pony's Pad which was an ideal room for us so we both had our own floors to get ready on and there is a beautiful patio to take pictures from without seeing other guests before the ceremony.  I look forward to coming back and celebrating our anniversaries with a fire, dinner at Henry's, and a massage at the spa.
Bachelorette Party: I recently brought one of my best friends to Buttermilk Spa for a Bachelorette Party. It was an experience beyond what I imagined!!! First and foremost, one of the receptionists, Oneika, was PHENOMENAL. She was so personable, even from the moment I called to make reservations from thousands of miles away! She was accommodating, friendly and helpful. I was SO glad to meet her the day of our arrival. The facilities were beautiful. Even though the day was rainy - to what some would say "gloomy" - the view of the grounds from the pool area was just beautiful! I especially loved the full windows we were able to open with a clear view of the farm. The sauna, steam room and pool were all clean. My actual favorite part was the shower in the bathroom with the waterfall shower-head. Thank you Buttermilk Spa for such an amazing experience!!!
Great place for a celebration.  We started out with salads.  Caesar Salad, a fancy beet salad and a spinach salad with strawberries - not sure which I'd get again, obviously not all 3 at once.  They were all fresh and tasty. For dinner I had the special surf and turf.  Normally that's a huge meal - not so much, but I still couldn't eat it all.  Bay scallops with a 5 oz. filet with a delicious sauce on the side and fingerlings.  Husband had the steak with mashed potatoes and I didn't get to taste it as he ate it too fast.  The birthday girl had crab stuffed salmon.  I'm getting that next time.  It was delicious!  Service was excellent as were the drinks...  forgot about those.  We split a cobbler for dessert.  Next time I won't do that - I want my own!
My husband and I have stayed in a few B&Bs before, but Buttermilk Falls Inn & Spa wins best breakfast, hands down.  The spread is amazing!  They even have gluten-free English muffins.  The best was definitely the cook-to-order hotcakes and egg dishes.  Hotcakes were big and fluffy.  The omelet and frittata... seriously never had better before.. don't know what the secret is besides that they use eggs from their farm and fresh vegetables.  I will go back to this place just for their egg dishes.  We spent one night here and had dinner at Henry's, the restaurant on site.  Although the food was okay, I much prefer the Inn's breakfast.  Also, dinner service was spotty and we had to wait long periods of time for our food to arrive.   As for the room, we stayed in a spacious guest house called Pony's Pad.  Basically it's a two-story (spiral staircase) cottage with a nice living area (w/sofa bed), fireplace, and kitchen on the main floor and then a beautiful bedroom with wide windows all across one wall and a skylight on the second floor.  Also on the second floor is a two-sink bathroom with a washer/dryer and a separate, HUGE shower room that is seriously crazy.  The wrap-around deck on the main floor is also pretty nice.  I wish we spent more than one night here.  Wifi was very spotty though.  Some might not care, some might--just be aware!  Wifi worked in the breakfast area and the main Inn, but we only got wifi in the room if we stood by the entrance area.   I didn't try any of the spa treatments but did take a dip in the pool and stuck my head in the sauna to check it out.  It was clean, but very small.  The areas around the Inn are gorgeous.  We experienced a light flurry of snow when there and it really was beautiful.  There are also some animals you can check out in the barn area--chicken, duck, llamas, etc.

What a lovely inn! The grounds are just beautiful, and it's so unique to be able to see and interact with animals. My husband and I stayed in the Winterberry, which was nice and rustic and included a whirlpool bath. Everyone here we interacted with was very kind. Even the coffee is great! And the tea time is a really lovely touch.

This is a great place to go for a quiet getaway. The accommodations are luxurious, the food superb, and it's convenient to Woodbury Common outlets, the quaint village of New Paltz, and Hyde Park, boyhood home of FDR. It's a large estate with a couple of large ponds (with resident ducks and geese) overlooking the Hudson. Very peaceful and pastoral. There is a train that goes by just across the Hudson, so if you're a very light sleeper, bring earplugs or turn on the fan in the room's a/c unit. (In addition to that a/c unit, they provide a space heater as well.) The room was beautiful, well-appointed, and quiet. Be advised that the pet-friendly rooms are on the second level. The bed was very comfy. The complimentary breakfast each morning was delicious and includes not only the cold buffet but a hot gourmet entree as well. They also do an afternoon tea with complimentary snacks, tea, and coffee. Included in the lodging rate is access to the indoor pool, sauna, and steam room, all of which are open till 7PM. The grounds have access to small hiking trails, including one to the eponymous Buttermilk Falls. There's also a farm with llamas, goats, and chickens. Parking in the main lot was a little tough on the weekend--there is more parking down a small road on the property--but during the week it was abundant. The staff and owner were very friendly and gracious. Navigation tip: Coming from Route 9W, look for Milton Road, which is renamed North Road a block or so after you make the turn. As a certain ex-governor of Cullyfornia said: "I'll be back!"

A wonderful spot for a weekend getaway! My boyfriend and I recently spent two nights at Buttermilk, and--having not taken a vacation in nearly a year--found it to be just the thing for two people in desperate need of relaxation. We stayed in the main lodging, and found our room to be just perfect. Terrific decor that harkened back to an earlier era, combined with the perfect dose of 21st century amenities like a flat-screen TV and a gas fireplace. The bed was incredibly comfortable (trust me, we probably slept 10 hours a night) and the room very quiet. The grounds were picturesque, lovely for strolls and a dose of fresh air before hunkering down to read magazines (or nap) in our room or the cozy common area. Food was another highlight. Breakfasts at the inn were absolutely insane (in such a good way). A full buffet spread--muffins, scones, fresh fruit salad, granola, yogurt, hard-boiled eggs, bagels, an assortment of bread--would have been more than enough. But they've also got a chef preparing several daily specials, like frittatas and waffles...food coma! We dined at Henry's both nights, and enjoyed everything there as well (the caesar salad, wine selection, and yummy pre-dinner rolls in particular). Massages at the spa were another highlight, and service was solid across the board. Why four stars instead of five? At times, the staff members were a little cold or dismissive...in one instance, we asked to leave our bags somewhere after we had checked out of the room but were waiting a few hours for our cab. The woman seemed miffed and irritated at the prospect, which was somewhat odd. And I would have appreciated an easier way to figure out activities--hikes? wine tours?--in the area. The inn offers brochures, but we never got a sense that someone was around to help or guide us in deciding what to do and how to do it. Minor thing, but would've been an awesome addition to the inn's offerings. Overall, though, we had a fabulous time. Already planning our return visit...this time maybe I'll make it to a yoga class or the gym, instead of just rolling out of bed and hitting the breakfast buffet for two hours.

I have visited Buttermilk Spa only one time but absolutely enjoyed my day there! It was very tranquil and peaceful.. the grounds there are absolutely beautiful and the service was right on the money.. I can't wait to go back there again this spring! I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to spend a day pampering themselves in very beautiful and peaceful surroundings!

I was disappointed in the spa experience. The pool area is small and the sauna seemed to be broken during most of our stay. The locker room is ridiculously small and I had to share a locker with my friend which was inconvenient and cramped. One bathroom stall and one shower stall for everyone. It seemed they overbooked for the day? I was actually quite shocked at the state of things. Dirty robes piled in the corner waiting to be fetched and no toilet paper. Come on guys.  My treatment was not horrible but nothing special. Technician was quite cold and not friendly of welcoming. It made for an awkward experience. I will definitely not use this spa again. Our room was lovely and we loved that part if the trip. Great space with fireplace and nice furnishings. Very clean. Also, the restaurant was cozy and lovely. Great cocktails and staff were very friendly and kind. The brunch in the morning was outstanding and the girls that made the food in the back were lovely. The frittata I had was out of this world, yum. Overall, I enjoyed the grounds and dining, but they really need to get their act together at the spa which is the main event here. I'm a bit shocked at all of these 5 star reviews.

My husband and I have stayed at Buttermilk a few times and even got married there.   The location is beautiful and it is one of the nicer renovated inns in the area but something is just off.  The staff is a bit whacky, inconsistent and rude.  There is something insincere about the front desk staff which makes you wonder why they are in the service and hospitality business.  We brushed off a few "misunderstandings", turnover of staff while in the middle of planning the wedding and a few quirky incidents before the wedding because we fell in love with the location and...already put down a serious deposit.   Our wedding guests are still talking about the funny stories/bad behavior from staff during our wedding weekend.  There was a range of moments from overcharging guests, screwing up room assignments and constantly telling guests it was the bride and groom's misunderstanding.  They trash talked guests to other guests, telling one couple that another couple's credit card was declined.  (WTF?) One guest got a massage at the spa and walked out with burns all over his back from the hot stones.  The salon overbooked themselves with guests and outside clients so they were running behind but their excuse they kept telling people was that the bride (me) has 3 hairstylists working on her and that's why they are behind. I barely had one hairstylist and I did my own make up!  They were outright lying and causing drama.   Aesthetic - Some rooms are designed and decorated better than others so it's hit or miss.  Some of the rooms are really nicely done and others are kind of dinky and seem more like a cheaply staged room vs. a high end hotel which is more like what they charge for a stay. Henry's restaurant is so so.  Food could be good but they can't get their act together.  We ate there 3 times and each time the orders were slightly wrong and or served cold or late.   Henry's is now the sole caterer they allow for weddings.  That is frightening.  We at least were able to hire an outside caterer at the time which were amazing (Main Course Catering). We have stayed here about 3 weekends throughout a year before our wedding and then our wedding weekend.   Feel like we can give a really honest and accurate review.  We will not be returning.  Not worth the money or aggravation which reverses the point of going to relax!
What a lovely inn! The grounds are just beautiful, and it's so unique to be able to see and interact with animals. My husband and I stayed in the Winterberry, which was nice and rustic and included a whirlpool bath. Everyone here we interacted with was very kind. Even the coffee is great! And the tea time is a really lovely touch.
Ended up here highly recommended by friends - one who had a gift certificate, another who came mid-week. We adored the room, the grounds, friendly staff, gorgeous spa, delicious breakfast. My husband and I are torn - I'd like to return in summer, he feels it's too expensive - a few thoughts: -our room (Sage Right), clean and nice, but quite small compared to others - if you have a choice, I'd recommend Sage Left or the others on first floor -spa *prices are pretty pricey - some more than/same as I pay in Brooklyn and neither of the services that I got seemed worth the price ($110 for swedish massage - good, but not worth 110 for 60 min; $120 for my husband's muscle melt - why $10 more for arnica gel? [and his masseuse gave him a scratch from her nails ;( ], $155 for body treatment which I do NOT recommend - basically non-massage massage with body scrub and lotion, better to get massage or spend money on a facial) *women's locker room shower didn't work "we're waiting on the knobs" the woman at the front desk said when I complained there wasn't hot water. better bet to shower in room or at poolside, but a bummer to not be able to shower in that lovely shower after a treatment *would be nice if water/tea were in pool area so you didn't have to walk back into welcome area in robe/towel and bathing suit -tea time - I had visions of delicious freshly-baked goods (especially since breakfast is nice), but it was cheese and crackers and same fruit from breakfast - it was just built up a lot to be nicer than it was. The taxes on the room are already pretty high, and you get to use the spa with your stay, so I'd either not get treatments next time or maybe they'll have some kind of deal? (% off for people staying at Inn would be a fabulous way to compensate - if you don't stay there you pay same price, so we're all paying for the upkeep? I find that a little weird). Also, the service at the restaurant was the worst I've ever experienced in my entire life, but I'll save that for my restaurant review - it was the first time in my life I've left 0 tip. All that said - if I had a midweek special and didn't get treatments, I'd go back in summer to experience it again. Just have to convince the hubby.

Buttermilk Falls Inn went beyond my expectations.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  The food was excellent, our room was great, and the grounds were absolutely beautiful.  We spent the first part of the day walking around feeding ducks, watching the sheep & lamas, and hiking a few small trails.  The latter half of the day was spent lounging by the fire place, and then off to the spa to get a massage.  The only part I did not love was that the masseuse complained twice that she had worked a 10 hour day.  I wanted to tell her that I regularly work 10 hours days, however I simply smiled.   Take the Metro-North up to Poughkeepsie, and rent a car there (we used Enterprise & they met us at the station).  From Poughkeepsie, drive across the river and you'll be there in less than 10 minutes.   I would highly recommend this B&B.

Zen. Buttermilk is the perfect hybrid: the charm and service of a B&B with the grounds and amenities of a resort.  In fact, I've come back home so relaxed, that my brain is too mushy to write a review. I'll be back soon.
I have visited Buttermilk Spa only one time but absolutely enjoyed my day there! It was very tranquil and peaceful.. the grounds there are absolutely beautiful and the service was right on the money.. I can't wait to go back there again this spring! I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to spend a day pampering themselves in very beautiful and peaceful surroundings!
Div and I came here with another couple for a weekend of relaxation and spa-ing.  This place is about 1.5 hours north of NYC and seems like it is out in the middle of nowhere.  We paid $850 total for a 2 bedroom apartment looking over the Hudson.  The view of the Hudson on the deck in the morning with a nice hot cup of coffee was priceless.  That was worth the cost right there.   The staff is extremely friendly.  The breakfasts that they include were delicious and the spa was beautiful.  The girls got massages / face masks, while my friend and I hung out at the pool and in the steam room.  I love when steam rooms have the freezing shower to cool you off.  We also had complimentary yoga in the morning which I sucked at, but still, it was nice to see how inflexible I really am.  They also have an afternoon tea which is not as grand as I suspected, but had delicious cookies! The only issue I had with this place was the restaurant on the property.  We ate dinner there the night we arrived at that was just a terrible terrible terrible experience.  I understand I am a bit spoiled by NYC and it's fast, efficient service.  But this was just unbearable.  The restaurant was half full and our waiter asked if we wanted a drink, after ordering, we waited 20 minutes (seriously, 20 minutes) before he brought us our drinks and took or order.  We then got the appetizers (20 minutes later) and had to wait an additional (30 minutes for our entrees).  My pasta was undercooked, but the pizza was good.  In total, it took us 2.5 hours to eat dinner, and we were not even drinking!  One of the worst dining experiences ever.   Other than that, the spa and B&B is beautiful.  I recommend either of the Riverknoll places...just don't eat at their restaurant.
I was disappointed in the spa experience. The pool area is small and the sauna seemed to be broken during most of our stay. The locker room is ridiculously small and I had to share a locker with my friend which was inconvenient and cramped. One bathroom stall and one shower stall for everyone. It seemed they overbooked for the day? I was actually quite shocked at the state of things. Dirty robes piled in the corner waiting to be fetched and no toilet paper. Come on guys.  My treatment was not horrible but nothing special. Technician was quite cold and not friendly of welcoming. It made for an awkward experience. I will definitely not use this spa again. Our room was lovely and we loved that part if the trip. Great space with fireplace and nice furnishings. Very clean. Also, the restaurant was cozy and lovely. Great cocktails and staff were very friendly and kind. The brunch in the morning was outstanding and the girls that made the food in the back were lovely. The frittata I had was out of this world, yum. Overall, I enjoyed the grounds and dining, but they really need to get their act together at the spa which is the main event here. I'm a bit shocked at all of these 5 star reviews.
I've been to Buttermilk several times and they are definitely a top notch Spa. I havent stayed over night but I have had many massages and facials and spent the day at the indoor pool. The view is incredible, the service is excellent. I do like to walk the grounds in the summer time as well. I loved the front where they have tea/coffee you can sip in all different flavors. They really do know how to cater to a guest. I would return. The only reason why they did not receive a 5 star rating is because I haven't stayed over night to experience the inn. When I do get there to check it out, I will leave another review.
This is one of those places one would like to keep a secret. Every aspect of this inn exceeds expectations. The grounds, trail and waterfall, the farm (with llamas, alpacas, geese, chickens, peacocks and adorable take-them-home with you ducks) and views of the Hudson are unparalleled. Add in the warm and friendly staff, the great breakfast and short stroll to restaurant and spa, and this cannot be beat. One can't help but feel the relaxation just stepping out of the car. The spa is every bit as good as any and the indoor pool is located in an "outdoor" room. We left walking on air...
My husband and I have stayed at Buttermilk a few times and even got married there.   The location is beautiful and it is one of the nicer renovated inns in the area but something is just off.  The staff is a bit whacky, inconsistent and rude.  There is something insincere about the front desk staff which makes you wonder why they are in the service and hospitality business.  We brushed off a few "misunderstandings", turnover of staff while in the middle of planning the wedding and a few quirky incidents before the wedding because we fell in love with the location and...already put down a serious deposit.   Our wedding guests are still talking about the funny stories/bad behavior from staff during our wedding weekend.  There was a range of moments from overcharging guests, screwing up room assignments and constantly telling guests it was the bride and groom's misunderstanding.  They trash talked guests to other guests, telling one couple that another couple's credit card was declined.  (WTF?) One guest got a massage at the spa and walked out with burns all over his back from the hot stones.  The salon overbooked themselves with guests and outside clients so they were running behind but their excuse they kept telling people was that the bride (me) has 3 hairstylists working on her and that's why they are behind. I barely had one hairstylist and I did my own make up!  They were outright lying and causing drama.   Aesthetic - Some rooms are designed and decorated better than others so it's hit or miss.  Some of the rooms are really nicely done and others are kind of dinky and seem more like a cheaply staged room vs. a high end hotel which is more like what they charge for a stay. Henry's restaurant is so so.  Food could be good but they can't get their act together.  We ate there 3 times and each time the orders were slightly wrong and or served cold or late.   Henry's is now the sole caterer they allow for weddings.  That is frightening.  We at least were able to hire an outside caterer at the time which were amazing (Main Course Catering). We have stayed here about 3 weekends throughout a year before our wedding and then our wedding weekend.   Feel like we can give a really honest and accurate review.  We will not be returning.  Not worth the money or aggravation which reverses the point of going to relax!
Just got back from Buttermilk Falls...I'm in love!  It was the most relaxing place with breathtaking views.  An absolute MUST!  The staff were so sweet, the food local and delicious.  Also, if you want to explore off the 70 acre grounds there is lots to do: wineries, hiking, shopping, and more. I'm already trying to plan my next trip!
Ended up here highly recommended by friends - one who had a gift certificate, another who came mid-week. We adored the room, the grounds, friendly staff, gorgeous spa, delicious breakfast. My husband and I are torn - I'd like to return in summer, he feels it's too expensive - a few thoughts: -our room (Sage Right), clean and nice, but quite small compared to others - if you have a choice, I'd recommend Sage Left or the others on first floor -spa *prices are pretty pricey - some more than/same as I pay in Brooklyn and neither of the services that I got seemed worth the price ($110 for swedish massage - good, but not worth 110 for 60 min; $120 for my husband's muscle melt - why $10 more for arnica gel? [and his masseuse gave him a scratch from her nails ;( ], $155 for body treatment which I do NOT recommend - basically non-massage massage with body scrub and lotion, better to get massage or spend money on a facial) *women's locker room shower didn't work "we're waiting on the knobs" the woman at the front desk said when I complained there wasn't hot water. better bet to shower in room or at poolside, but a bummer to not be able to shower in that lovely shower after a treatment *would be nice if water/tea were in pool area so you didn't have to walk back into welcome area in robe/towel and bathing suit -tea time - I had visions of delicious freshly-baked goods (especially since breakfast is nice), but it was cheese and crackers and same fruit from breakfast - it was just built up a lot to be nicer than it was. The taxes on the room are already pretty high, and you get to use the spa with your stay, so I'd either not get treatments next time or maybe they'll have some kind of deal? (% off for people staying at Inn would be a fabulous way to compensate - if you don't stay there you pay same price, so we're all paying for the upkeep? I find that a little weird). Also, the service at the restaurant was the worst I've ever experienced in my entire life, but I'll save that for my restaurant review - it was the first time in my life I've left 0 tip. All that said - if I had a midweek special and didn't get treatments, I'd go back in summer to experience it again. Just have to convince the hubby.
I happened upon an invite to a wedding at this fabuous venue... The ambiance is exquisite---a waterfall---clear skies...and solitude....in the middle of this...  the most exquisite wedding ceremony The main house is complete with antique decor--- An accomodating staff. Available to larger parites as well as a B&B venue, Absolutely picturesque. The day before the wedding we took in the farm experience....lulling about to feed the animals and just observe them in their own habitat. The staff were knowledgable and no question seemed out of sorts. The Farm metamorphed into a grand wedding center...the very next day. The catering was superb...and the timing was as if there were no clocks ticking. The music echoed softly among the stars...and everyone had a great time. I would surely return...a new fav place.
Buttermilk Falls Inn went beyond my expectations.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  The food was excellent, our room was great, and the grounds were absolutely beautiful.  We spent the first part of the day walking around feeding ducks, watching the sheep & lamas, and hiking a few small trails.  The latter half of the day was spent lounging by the fire place, and then off to the spa to get a massage.  The only part I did not love was that the masseuse complained twice that she had worked a 10 hour day.  I wanted to tell her that I regularly work 10 hours days, however I simply smiled.   Take the Metro-North up to Poughkeepsie, and rent a car there (we used Enterprise & they met us at the station).  From Poughkeepsie, drive across the river and you'll be there in less than 10 minutes.   I would highly recommend this B&B.
My boyfriend and I went to Buttermilk Falls, it is a great place to relax. It is quiet, the animal farm is nice, you can have great walks and the spa is fantastic for massages, and facials. The room we got was cute, although later on we saw other rooms and some rooms are much better then others. We were in the capitans room, which was fine, i myself was not able to sleep well, but that can be personal. We did not get to try the restaurant because it was closed monday and tuesday. I thought that the steam room/sauna/pool are ok, nothing special . Over all relaxing
Zen. Buttermilk is the perfect hybrid: the charm and service of a B&B with the grounds and amenities of a resort.  In fact, I've come back home so relaxed, that my brain is too mushy to write a review. I'll be back soon.
Me and my husband went for our "babymoon" in April and overall had a nice stay. We booked Pony's Pad, which is a modern charming bi-level 1 bedroom cottage with a wrap around porch, kitchen, living room and washer/dryer. their breakfasts (included) were delicious, fresh and generous, along with a nice spread for their daily afternoon tea.  We thought all the staff were pleasant and helpful. Henry's restaurant had good food but was a little pricey and are closed Monday and Tuesday We paid a little extra and got the Spark and Spa package which included a picnic bag and blanket. unfortunately, we couldnt use it because the big hilly lawn behind Pony's Pad that overlooks the Hudson was literally a mine field of goose poop....I mean mushy green defecation everywhere. I dont know how they clean it up for weddings and events. another thing that was disappointing was housekeeping. sometimes they loaded the dishwasher and ran it, sometimes dirty dishes and glasses weren't collected at all. Also, we were fine with not having our sheets changed everyday, but we wanted it changed at least once during our 5 nite stay. each time they would make the bed but not give us fresh bedding. One a.m. we put the cleaning sign on the bed, half stripped the mattress and took off some pillowcases, thinking they would change it for sure. but it was clear they made the bed with the same exact sheets and cases! Another thing they don't advertise, if you are staying in Pony's Pad, the Riverbirch or Riverknoll Houses, you will be woken in the middle of the nite by a train going pressing its horn, almost every half hour, and then by loud vocal ducks and geese at 6am!

This is a really lovely inn with updated amenities and tasteful antique decor. I usually don't like B&B type places but this Inn is really well kept and clean. Service was very friendly. We checked in after 5pm and the receptionist invited us to have sweets and teas and kept it out just for us. The inn has a restaurant which is located on the property just a few steps from the main house. We were able to enjoy a dinner there since we had a $100 voucher. The restaurant is decorated in modern farm style.  Everything we ordered was delicious. My hubby really enjoyed the crab cake app and his steak dish. I had the Caesar salad and pan seared scallops which were cooked to perfection and phenomenal!  The dish was served on spaghetti squash. I have no idea how it was cooked but it tasted amazing. We stayed in the Sage Left room on the first which was beautifully decorated with an amazing view from the patio of the pond and Hudson river. I keep hinting to my husband how lovely it would be to come back in the summer or fall again so we can enjoy the blooming flowers and foliage. The breakfast room which is a part of the main inn is really nice with a patio that looks out towards the pond and river. The food was ok. The menu items were limited but there was a also a continental spread with several options like bagels, banana bread, scones, fruits, yogurt, cereal and oatmeal. My husband and I really enjoyed the grounds and the pool at the spa. You can spend an hour or two just strolling by the duck ponds and farm where there are alpaca, goats, chickens, etc. I plan to go back again and hope there will be another promo or deal out there as it would be expensive at full price.
This is one of those places one would like to keep a secret. Every aspect of this inn exceeds expectations. The grounds, trail and waterfall, the farm (with llamas, alpacas, geese, chickens, peacocks and adorable take-them-home with you ducks) and views of the Hudson are unparalleled.

the grounds are absolutely beautiful. the restaurant is amazing. the spa services - absolutely terrible. nail staff was wholly unprofessional, but more important did a terrible job. i could do a better manicure. she kept messing up, and i have bubbles all over my nails, patchy coverage, excess ALL over my fingers, not to mention the nail tech cut my cuticles so poorly, that i now have hang nails, rough edges and redness i didn't have before. she really didnt know what she was doing, and i have no idea how long it's going to take to recover from that experience (one day later and washing my hands still stings). not to mention she was checking her phone, distracted, etc. and for $30 i expect at least a little bit of a scrub/soak or light lotion/massage. absolutely NOTHING. reflexology was the equivalent of not getting anything done at all. absolutely no pressure, really it was like having someone hold your foot gently for a half hour. the services in the city are much cheaper and better value for money. for the premium you pay i would expect a base level of service. it was sadly totally lacking. i would come again, but definitely not for the services - rather to visit the grounds and eat at Henry's - which was delish.
We went for dinner at Henry's at Buttermilk, and have to say Wow, were we impressed! The service started off a little slow, however, they more than made up for it with a great menu. The appetizers were very good, and our entree's blew us away. And we dine at some of the highest-rated place in NYC, so that doesn't not come lightly. All of that, and it's a farm-to-table restaurant supporting local farms and organic produce. The most expensive item was $32 I believe (the lamb done two ways), and that was great. My wife had the risotto and I was very eager to share hers. Our total tab, including 3 glasses of wine and a martini was about $120 (sans tax) - very impressive. We are definitely bringing friends and suggesting this to others.

My boyfriend and I went for the day to have brunch at Henrys and then go for a spa appointment. I must say that we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Henrys for brunch was amazing. Serivce was wondeful and the food was impeccable. We had the beet salad, duck and eggs, and omelette. I dont think we have ever cleared our plates completely but here we did. Wonderful. The spa visit was equally nice. When we went on a Sunday it was not crowded at all. It was quiet and tranquil. The pool and saunas were clean. Our treatments were enjoyable. For people who say that it was "eh" remember that you should communicate with your masseuse about how you like your treatments. They are professionals, not mind readers. What was really great was after the treatment, just being able to relax at the poolside or sauna kept the relaxation vibes going (its the one thing I hate about getting a treatment in the city..you get all relaxed and the minute you walk out onto the sidewalk, BAM, all the tenseness comes back). The grounds are quaint. For those thinking its going to be a 75 acre hike, nope, its very walkable for kids and family.

This place is your home away from home!!! The food is amazing, the grounds are beautiful, the spa is heaven, the farm is unique, and the staff is absolutely amazing!!! Deb is the best... She brought me chicken when salmon  was the only thing on the menu and she even washed a load of clothes for me! LOVE HER!!! THANK YOU for an amazing week!

My wife and I stayed at Buttermilk Falls for a mid-week 3-night break.  We stayed in the Juniper Room - a room with a king bed and private balcony. We both loved our stay at Buttermilk Falls.  The room was wonderful, with a great combination of B&B charm and modern amenities.  As a technical person, I was happy to see full cable TV on a flat-screen HDTV in the room, and a strong wifi connection.  My wife loved the decor and room amenities.  There are many little touches that make the stay easier, from the closet light that comes on automatically when the door is opened to the jets in the tub to the fireplace in the room (which we didn't use, as it was the end of May).  Sitting on our balcony at night with a glass of wine and some cheese was wonderful. The staff and management couldn't have been any friendlier or more helpful.  When we arrived there were a few minor issues with the room that were not the fault of the Inn (more the fault of a previous guest) and they were resolved quickly.  They also accommodated a minor request of ours that made our stay more comfortable.  We were warmly greeted by everyone from the management down to the maintenance staff that we met as we walked the grounds.  The dinner recommendation made one night was a terrific choice that only locals would have known about. We used the spa as well.  This was my first trip to a spa, so I have no frame of reference, but it seemed nice to me.  My wife who has more experience approved as well. For my next trip, I'm thinking about trying the intriguing Pony's Pad - a cottage one-bedroom suite with two levels and a kitchenette, as well as a great view of the river. I strongly recommend Buttermilk Falls Inn for anyone needing a getaway or who has reason to be in the Poughkeepsie/Hyde Park/New Paltz area.

My review might be influenced by the fact that we drove there the night of our wedding for a mini-moon and were in our own newlywed blissful world, but we loved the inn, the grounds, the breakfasts (amazing) and Henry's restaurant. I saw other comments that the service was slow at the restaurant. I didn't find that to be true, and they were very nice as well. Although it wasn't busy the night we went. The property is gorgeous and well-kept. That falls were so-so, but I'm from Ithaca, NY so they didn't have much chance competing with the Buttermilk falls there. I'm looking to going back there for anniversaries. It was overall lovely, relaxing and delicious. (We stayed in the Lotus Room, which was at the end of a hall and was very private. The decor was perfect, and the whirlpool tub and fireplace were a nice touch.)

I have went here 3 separate times in the last 3 years: July, February, & just this weekend. Each time it has been an amazing experience. I went with my mom the 1st time and the other times I have went with my boyfriend. It is ALWAYS clean. The breakfast is AMAZING. The staff is  FRIENDLY and super HELPFUL. I visited the spa each time, lovely! Seriously there is nothing I say that is a negative. I totally LOVE this place.

Very clean, neat, modern cottage. Our room was a bit loud, located basically on the parking lot, and an annoying refridge motor didn't help. The farm to table restaurant, though lacking in the service department, was quite tasty. The grounds are beautiful and well maintained. We love the animals on the farm( especially those super-soft alpacas! ). Can't wait to come back to try the spa..but will take my time as the rooms are a bit pricey for upstate NY vacationing.

My husband and I had Thanksgiving dinner at Henry's Farm to Table restaurant at Buttermilk Falls Inn & Spa. It was wonderful. Far surpassed our expectations. The food was fresh and we understand from all local farms. The food was not over "buttered" or over "creamed." We left feeling full, but not overly. It really was delicious! The grounds are beautiful with breathtaking views of the Hudson River Valley and the falls. There are several hiking trails that take you across beautiful ponds with Swans and other birds. We did not stay at the Inn, but definitely are planning on it. The peacefulness and serenity of the grounds were bidding us to return. I highly recommend Henry's!
This place is your home away from home!!! The food is amazing, the grounds are beautiful, the spa is heaven, the farm is unique, and the staff is absolutely amazing!!! Deb is the best... She brought me chicken when salmon  was the only thing on the menu and she even washed a load of clothes for me! LOVE HER!!! THANK YOU for an amazing week!
Couldn't recommend this precious spot more.  it's the perfect combination of (non creepy) B&B, beautifully manicured grounds, breath-taking nature, exotic livestock, bicycles, tennis, MODERN spa and indoor pool, yoga, attentive service, tastefully decorated rooms, and impeccably DELICIOUS food at Henry's restaurant...all less than a 2 hour drive from NYC, with nearby towns of New Paltz, Cold Springs and Beacon to venture out to- let alone the Shawangunk wine trail.  All at reasonable prices too!  do yourself/your loved one a favor, and book a room asap!  LOVED it.

We both loved our stay at Buttermilk Falls.  The room was wonderful, with a great combination of B&B charm and modern amenities.  As a technical person, I was happy to see full cable TV on a flat-screen HDTV in the room, and a strong wifi connection.  My wife loved the decor and room amenities.  There are many little touches that make the stay easier, from the closet light that comes on automatically when the door is opened to the jets in the tub to the fireplace in the room (which we didn't use, as it was the end of May).  Sitting on our balcony at night with a glass of wine and some cheese was wonderful. The staff and management couldn't have been any friendlier or more helpful.  When we arrived there were a few minor issues with the room that were not the fault of the Inn (more the fault of a previous guest) and they were resolved quickly.  They also accommodated a minor request of ours that made our stay more comfortable.  We were warmly greeted by everyone from the management down to the maintenance staff that we met as we walked the grounds.  The dinner recommendation made one night was a terrific choice that only locals would have known about. We used the spa as well.  This was my first trip to a spa, so I have no frame of reference, but it seemed nice to me.  My wife who has more experience approved as well. For my next trip, I'm thinking about trying the intriguing Pony's Pad - a cottage one-bedroom suite with two levels and a kitchenette, as well as a great view of the river. I strongly recommend Buttermilk Falls Inn for anyone needing a getaway or who has reason to be in the Poughkeepsie/Hyde Park/New Paltz area.
This place was highly recommended by friends.  We recently spent two nights in the Pony's Pad, the duplex accommodation.   What a wonderful experience.  The rooms were bright and clean with excellent facilities.  The Inn's grounds were beautiful and well maintained.  Spa services were superb.  The complimentary breakfast was fantastic.; eggs were fresh from the on site farm along with the organic vegetables.  Staff members were friendly and knowledgeable.  In addition, we found the Inn was well located for local sightseeing a short drive to most local points of interest. Can't wait to return.
My review might be influenced by the fact that we drove there the night of our wedding for a mini-moon and were in our own newlywed blissful world, but we loved the inn, the grounds, the breakfasts (amazing) and Henry's restaurant. I saw other comments that the service was slow at the restaurant. I didn't find that to be true, and they were very nice as well. Although it wasn't busy the night we went. The property is gorgeous and well-kept. That falls were so-so, but I'm from Ithaca, NY so they didn't have much chance competing with the Buttermilk falls there. I'm looking to going back there for anniversaries. It was overall lovely, relaxing and delicious. (We stayed in the Lotus Room, which was at the end of a hall and was very private. The decor was perfect, and the whirlpool tub and fireplace were a nice touch.)
I have went here 3 separate times in the last 3 years: July, February, & just this weekend. Each time it has been an amazing experience. I went with my mom the 1st time and the other times I have went with my boyfriend. It is ALWAYS clean. The breakfast is AMAZING. The staff is  FRIENDLY and super HELPFUL. I visited the spa each time, lovely! Seriously there is nothing I say that is a negative. I totally LOVE this place.
Very clean, neat, modern cottage. Our room was a bit loud, located basically on the parking lot, and an annoying refridge motor didn't help. The farm to table restaurant, though lacking in the service department, was quite tasty. The grounds are beautiful and well maintained. We love the animals on the farm( especially those super-soft alpacas! ). Can't wait to come back to try the spa..but will take my time as the rooms are a bit pricey for upstate NY vacationing.
My husband and I had Thanksgiving dinner at Henry's Farm to Table restaurant at Buttermilk Falls Inn & Spa. It was wonderful. Far surpassed our expectations. The food was fresh and we understand from all local farms. The food was not over "buttered" or over "creamed." We left feeling full, but not overly. It really was delicious! The grounds are beautiful with breathtaking views of the Hudson River Valley and the falls. There are several hiking trails that take you across beautiful ponds with Swans and other birds. We did not stay at the Inn, but definitely are planning on it. The peacefulness and serenity of the grounds were bidding us to return. I highly recommend Henry's!

This place is awesome, totally beautiful inn and property, the staff was delightful and the service was brilliant.  Spa is new and clean and beautiful.  Henry's is downright amazing.  And breakfast in the inn is an ideal way to relive the prior day's experiences.  All around a delightful and better-even-than-expected visit, we'll be back for sure.
Best trip ever! I went to the place for a week for a work trip and it ended up being the best vacation ever! The place is gorgeous, the food is fabulous and the service is amazing! The people were polite and friendly and I can't wait to come back again with my family as a vacation! The food was organic, yummy and healthy! The rooms were spacious, clean and luxurious! I can't wait to come back again with my family for a vacation.
I've waited to write this review because I wanted to give Buttermilk a chance (over a year!) to correct my situation but they haven't done anything... so here I am. I took my boyfriend here for the weekend last year for his birthday. We had a nice dinner and walk around the property. However, our experience at the spa was terrible. I ordered a couples massage for my boyfriend's birthday but they put us in different rooms. My boyfriend received what he called a "fast rubdown with no pressure applied" by someone who was not experienced. I was given a massage by someone who's hands had the texture of cement (literally). It felt like I was being rubbed with sandpaper. I didn't want to hurt the girl's feelings so I stayed quiet. Both my boyfriend and I left that weekend feeling like we paid for services we didn't get. Two days later, a rash developed on my legs. I emailed the spa to let them know (as an FYI about the woman who worked on me) and they said she had a reaction to the products they used (why let her work then and why use those products then, I wondered?!). A girl I work with had suggested the Inn because she had been there over a year ago. She knew about  the girl with the rough hands so the Inn must have not been telling the truth when they implied that the "allergic reaction" was a new, temporary issue. The Inn suggested I come back for a free service, which was odd to me. Why would I come back? Two days after that, my legs swelled and I had painful sores everywhere. My doctor did some tests and found out I had a serious staff infection. I missed critical hours at work, had to wear baggy clothes for two weeks because of the pain, and had scars for almost 6 months. I wrote Buttermilk to tell them what happened and they offered nothing. So, I spent over $1,000 that weekend at Buttermilk and came away with a bad experience, a painful staff infection and more stress than I had before going on the weekend trip. All I wanted was for the Inn to take responsibility for it's mismanagement and to be compensated by returning the money I had paid them for the relaxing weekend. It's alarming that they've done neither and so I suggest you think twice about investing time and hope for relaxation at this place.

This is a beautiful property truly. We took walks around the grounds every morning, and enjoyed the ducks, llamas, birds and more. It was heaven on earth. We spent four days here and loved the breakfasts by Susan, who made the most delicious quinoa and veggies for a healthy option. (I'm already trying to replicate at home.) Dinner at Henry's Table was really nice, especially watching the sun go down while eating on the balcony. My one recommendation would be to spend the extra money and stay at one of the cottages; the rooms in the inn are very tight together and it feels like someone walking down the hall is walking across your bed. Otherwise, found the staff very helpful and accommodating and the inn and grounds well-maintained.

Absolutely love this spa.  Once you pull onto the Buttermilk grounds, you don't feel like your anywhere close to home.  The spa is very modern with a focus on sustainability. The spa services are great. Heidi is the BEST masseuse they have. They have a pool, sauna and steam room. Overall this is a great spot for a relaxing day.

I come here very often with my husband and it is always amazing. Extremely relaxing and serene environment. Heidi gives the best massages if you like deep tissue or a sport massage. If you book a service, you can spend the entire day at the spa and on some days they offer poolside yoga classes. If your looking to have a romantic and relaxing Sunday, this is the place! They also offer 10% off all services for people who live locally.

Just came back from our 4th visit and Buttermilk Falls was as wonderful as ever. This truly is the most relaxing place you can imagine. The service was friendly as always and our room with a fireplace and jacuzzi tub was great. Definitely take time to wander around and see the animals and if you're up for it, feed the geese. They have a new chef at the restaurant and the food was much better than the last time. Now we are just trying to figure out when we can go back for visit number 5.
