Super cute little art supply shop connect to the Arts Center for the Capitol Region (gallery). It's the sister store of Central Art Supply that used to be on Lark. Prices are fair - they're really the only game in town, and they don't gouge the prices. Selection is surprising, given the size. Drawing pads, painting pads, charcoal, wooden figure models, oils, acrylics, watercolors, brushes, solvents - a wandering artist could get whatevever s/he needs here.
