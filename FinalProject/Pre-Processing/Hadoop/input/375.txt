Through childhood play and teen-aged hanging out, I've spent years of my life at the Oval. Like every day... and yet I struggle to describe it to people. Cause see, it once was a reservoir...so it's a big, drained-dry-reservoir-turned-park. It's like this double decker park...kind of. There's a running track at the sunken to the bottom of the reservoir, with a soccer field in its middle. Paved, tree-shaded walks surround the lower-level oval and lead you to playgrounds, basketball, tennis, and bocce courts and more. Walk up the stairs, or run up a grassy hill bowl, there's the upper oval. After a good snow, we'd sled down them in our red plastic saucers, though there might be the danger of snow-hidden dog sh*t. The top level strolls round, overlooking the park trough the trees, as neighborhood street scenes outline the rim.
I almost got robbed for my iPhone 4 in front of this park. There is always kids smoking pot and others smoking cigarettes inside the park around other peoples children.
You best be careful during the day because there are a ton of unruly students playing hooky who hang out there, smoking pot and even one time, were causing chaos, throwing tennis balls at each other, while I jogged through them and almost got hit with one of them.  But if you were to confront them, a gang of 20 15 year olds can definitely cause you a beating or worse.  Yet the cops rarely patrol that park.  Otherwise, it's a nice park, but I suggest you go ONLY after 10am, when those brats who should be in school leave.  That park is very nice considering it's the "Bronx".
Beautiful park and it is undergoing a renovation.  It now has a new track, new turf, and a new playground.  Soon an updated rec. center will open.  It needs some love and is definitely getting some from the active neighborhood people... visit and enjoy and support!
