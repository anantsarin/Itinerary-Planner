I had a coupon for a 1 1/2 hour spa facial and shoulder massage. Gilda was amazing! Twice I started to fall asleep. My skin feels awesome, the facial was the most thorough I've ever had. I will definitely be going back!
I had the pleasure of meeting Sally Jo who did the most amazing and most comprehensive pedicure that I have experienced in the Rochester area.  I have visited some of the nicest locations in this city and I recommend her services and her slogan is you should not have to take out a loan to have a pedicure.  She does a fantastic job.  Give her a call and tell her Sandi and Courtney sent you!
