By reviewing this place, I'm gonna blow up my own spot. I've been coming here for years, it's been a well kept secret of mine.  They have a dizzying array of leather, both scraps and whole hides, fur, feathers, chair caning supplies and more.  Without question, this is a true old time shop, from the golden age of America.   One of the walls celebrates how many years Craft Service has been in business with cutout newspaper articles marking their success and longevity. What do I go here for?  The rare and hard to find stuff.  Belt buckles, hardware, and other findings.  For some strange reason, they always seem to have all of the discontinued Minwax Stains in stock.  Rochester has changed substantially over the years, but Craft Service is a time capsule, and that's what I love about it.
Craft Service is a true jewel in Rochester.  My mom remembers the store being there when she was a student at Eastman back in the 1950s when the dorms were just down the street near the Memorial Art Gallery.  I moved away some years ago, but keep coming back when I'm in town for interesting items for so many great craft projects - caning, balsa, wax for candles, models, leather, beading, ...  It's funny, but the fact that this store is still here gives me this warm feeling.  I continue to bring my business here when I can and encourage you all in Rochester to support this fantastic resource and institution in your midst. As the others note, they remain cash only, so come prepared with your greenbacks!
Going into Craft Service is like stepping back in time - to arts and crafts at summer camp.  I mean that in the best possible way!  I particularly enjoy it for the leather assortment they have - full pelts, scraps, samples and kits. I believe they have supplies for caning chairs and woodworking too, not to mention your basic art supplies (paper and paint). Remember to bring cash, since they don't accept credit cards.
