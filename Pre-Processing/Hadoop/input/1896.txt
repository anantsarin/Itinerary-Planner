I come here quite often for lunch, its definitely a go-to place for me. They have a great lunch sushi special. The sushi is always very fresh, the presentation is beautiful and they are good sized. Their spicy mayo is house made and not that great, especially because they charge you for a side. When I come the service is so slow, so it's either really bad all the time or just because they're bored. You usually have to work hard to get someone's attention. Atmosphere is relaxed and pretty. Prices are good. I always have hot tea, but they do have a full bar.
My brother lives in the area and he recommended this place. It's in a nondescript strip mall and looks are deceiving, but you cannot judge a book by its cover. Exquisitely decorated on the interior with Japanese decor and a hibachi setting in the front half and a traditional restaurant in the back. We were served promptly and drinks served immediately, along with our food order. I ordered the Mango Tango roll and Rainbow roll, and our party had all kinds of hibachi -- chicken, steak, scallops, shrimp, and salmon. One person in our party had severe gluten allergies, so our chef cooked using separate utensils. The sushi was good, but not the best I've had. The dinner was the best I've had. The portion was large and food was delicious. I will definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants good Japanese hibachi.
We live next door to Kobe and usually walk to/from each time we eat out. The ambiance is "city" like, with very nice decor and trendy designs-including led lights, leather chairs, and great food. The staff is attentive and we never find ourselves waiting for service. Traditionally, we only dine in, but on the few occasions we've done hibachi, it's a large room with over six tables, and a talented staff. Granite counters and very clean surfaces, make eating here a great experience. The sake selection is extensive, and I've grown to like the Sayuri, and pair it with rolls of sushi and Sapporo. Kobe is definitely underrated as a sushi place, per the crowds that often flood to the hibachi tables each weekend. It's great for groups and is reasonably priced. Also, they offer coupons on occasions too. The bar: the first thing you'll notice when you walk in is the epic bar! Although they do not have beers on tap, their bottle selection is great and their mixed drinks are unique and of average price. It's really a fun bar with a nice layout-combining urban chic design with neon lights and plenty of room to hang out for a while. Don't hesitate!
Fun atmosphere. Hibachi dinner is a good value meal. Very entertaining yet the chef will pass on his tricks if you've been there before and really just want a good meal without the show.  They also have a great happy hour (5-7).  Discounted drinks and sushi.  Nice clean atmosphere. Lots of seating so never a wait.
Pretty good overall.  Not completely authentic, as I had the pad thai, and it had those chinese brown bean curd strips (then again, this isn't a thai place).  The sashimi was great for the most part, with the exception of the fluke, which tasted a bit old.  wanted to try the uni (sea urchin) and the toro (fatty tuna) but they were out.  definitely wanna try the AYCE and see how it compares to Sushi Village
I had sushi here nearly 2 weeks ago.  I have frequented this place a handful of times prior, the appearance is clean and I had always had a good experience.  This time I was delayed in picking up my order and it was sitting out on the counter.  When I asked why it wasn't refrigerated they said I was late and should have called.  Please believe me when I tell you, you do NOT want to eat unsafe sushi. 20 or so visits to the bathroom later (and not in a good way), I called to a) let them know I did not want ANYTHING from them and b) wanted to help them protect future customers against getting sick like I did.   I spoke with both owners and all they were interested in was making me go away, they did not want to own anything having to do with fixing their practices thus making things better.  I suggested they refrigerate the sushi till the clients come in.  That's it. They once again resorted to blaming me for not coming in on time, rather than agreeing they should refrigerate their fish till the customer comes.  When I told them I got sick, they asked if I had a doctors note to prove it. When I said I'd call they health dept, they hung up the phone on me.   I strongly recommend you not trust these people to look out for your safety with their terrible attitude and poor food safety practices.
So yummy! Every time I have been I have always had great service and even better food!
Not a bad hibachi restaurant. The people who waited on us were all pretty friendly and even gave some of us free sake! The interior is really nice looking so it's a cool spot to check out.
Dinner with friends and we were pleasantly surprised. Dinner was really good along with the entertainment. We enjoyed a smorgasbord of sushi and it did not disappoint. It's pretty good for a mall restaurant.
We came here last Saturday night and it's been at least 8 months since the last time we were here.  Everything is still pretty good.  Great sushi & great atmosphere.  I had a nice dinner of the same ole "7 for $30".  You just cant beat it.  As usual on a Saturday, the hibatchi section of the was crowded an electric.  One day, I'll have to venture over there...meanwhile, Kobe is pretty hard to beat for sushi in the area.
Probably our favorite hibachi place in the area, the atmosphere is perfect and the food simply delicious. Great for the whole family or a night out with friends.
While we have had some delish dinners there,( be careful with the soft drinks instant IBS)  it only takes one time to screw it up. We ordered takeout and the bottoms of the take out containers melted out. I called to complain, the owner called me back only to give me his resume and say this has never happened before . Well it did to us. I was not interested in excuses. Just wanted my money back and I wasn't returning the food as they asked me to come back that night. ( unless they paid for my gas) Was happy to return containers within the week.. He said " we don't know what you have done to them" hahahahaha what a knucklehead. Sorry you are X'd .  Don't waste your money. Go The Gasho much better!!!!
THis review is only for their service, as we didn't get pass their nasty waitress' attitude to stay for the food. Visited this restaurant for a birthday dinner, wanted to try their hibachi. When we got there, there was a few parties at the hibachi tables, the waitress sat us down with another family. (which we later found that they were there a while before we got there, and put in their order a while ago, they didn't get their food up until the time we left) It was our first time, so it took us a while to decide what we want, the waitress came back 2 - 3 times within 5-10 mins to hurry us up on ordering. When we finally ordered, i told her someone in our party is allergic to seafood, hoping she can tell me they can make an effort to separate the food. she then said "so we will cook his food inside the kitchen" which to me, defeat the purpose of hibachi. the whole time she was less than pleasant, seemed like she didnt want to be bother and hurry us along so she can go home. we ended up just got up and left. I am normally not a snobby person when it comes to service. just didn't feel like paying for crappy service at a hibachi restaurant, which to me, was more than just "food".
Don't go for the all-you-can-eat sushi. The selection was limited and didn't have any specialty rolls. Pretty pricy for California rolls and spicy tuna rolls. They didn't even have sriracha sauce.
My wife and I went when they first opened and thought that it was very enjoyable.  What stands out is their fried rice; it was the best either of us had anywhere.  We have been back frequently since and have been impressed by their sit-down menu.  They have a nice variety of pan-Asian foods from Thai to Vietnamese to Chinese and Japanese, all done well.
This is my go-to spot for sushi in the Poughkeepsie area. I've never had a bad meal here and the prices are on par with the rest of the sushi restaurants in the area.  They give you a fair amount of food, nothing to brag or complain about, but it sure is tasty and always fresh. The inside of the restaurant is really neat too with Japanese decorations and the music is always at the perfect volume. I like that the hibachi area is completely seperate from the dining area so those in the dining area aren't exposed to all of the comotion that goes on in the hibachi room. My only complaint about Kobe is that the waitresses hover; as soon as you sit down they ask if you want a drink. They're back in about 3 seconds with the drinks (which is great) but they're asking if you know what you want before you even have the menu open.
Went there last night with my Family for Hibachi. Food was great and and fresh. We all had some Filet Mignon and Seafood combo. They now have a liquor license, The warm sake was excellent as well as the sake squirt shots from the chef. The Hibachi chef was very entertaining and funny. I will definitely add this one to my list of my regular restaurants.
Delicious! We have been wanting to take our little ones for hibachi and this place was great!
Oh my goodness, this place is delicious. They have fantastic sushi and hibachi. I have been there multiple times and have been happy every time. Great service too.
I just had my fifth or sixth dinner at this fine establishment, and I will be back again!  Everything from the sushi to the hibachi and cocktails are top notch, and resemble the quality I would expect in my adopted hometown of Brooklyn. The service is attentive and the food is light and flavorful. I recommend the mandarin duck, filet mignon, and their featured special roles. In the mood for a drink?  Try the Hurricane. Beautiful interior and outstanding customer service.
Don't let the outside appearance fool you, this hibachi restaurant blows all the others in the area away!  It has been completely redone on the inside, and the food quality is topnotch.  No more Osho for me, Kobe is better and cheaper, superior in every aspect.
As a parent, it is often difficult to find a restaurant that does little more than just tolerate your kids' presence.  Kobe is a welcome departure from that trend, and really do go out of their way to make your whole party feel welcome. This evening they deftly attended to our entire party of 16 people, 8 of whom were children, including 3 toddlers. It is definitely refreshing to go out for a good family meal with kids without it being a buffet or Chuck E Cheese. Kudos to Kobe!
Have been to Kobe a few times, food always excellent!! Extensive menu from sushi to hibachi. Awesome contemporary decor. Very welcoming staff. They always play with our children while we have a drink at the bar waiting for our takeout. If they werent in that plaza I be the place would be more well known. The best Asian cuisine in poughkeepsie.
Came here this past Friday with a group of people for a friends Birthday. Hubby and I hung out at the bar while we waited for everyone else to arrive. Drink prices were average and bartender (Katie) was friendly and mixed a good drink. I had the eel avocado roll while we waited and he had Gyoza. Gyoza was run of the mill and the eel avocado was ok, could have used a bit more eel, but tasty none the less. The other sushi items I saw being brought to diners looked delicious, but alas, we were there for the Hibachi. I didn't see much of the Hibachi show due to hanging at the bar with another friend, but the hubby brought my plate out to me and everything was tasty and there was a TON of food (I got the shrimp and chicken combo). The dessert they brought out was meh, the tempura bananas tasted awful, but the ice cream was good. Prices were typical of other Hibachi placed I had dined at before. Don't let the strip mall placement fool you, the inside is really nice and clean. As they say, don't judge a book by its cover!
Don't be fooled that it is crappy because it is next to price chopper!!! I just wanted to say that we have been there about 10-15 times for lunch and dinner and we have yet to be disappointed, That atmosphere is very modern, almost like a NYC vibe restaurant. We don't care for hibachi but we love the rolls and pai Thai. The food selection is great, the rolls are cheaper than many places, the specialty rolls are amazing, and the specialty entrees are all less than $19. The only negative is that they haven't acquires a liquor license yet as of march 22nd 2011.  We have tried atleast 5 other sushi restaurants in Poughkeepsie and this seems to be my top 2. Thanks!
A solid Asian food restaurant. It has a broad menu that will likely appeal to everyone. They also have a hibachi section for people that want a little entertainment with their food. They have a decent sake selection as well. On the downside, the food is just okay. They try to do a bunch of different styles, and don't really end up doing any of them super well. This place is great for groups.
this review does not reflect the hibachi portion of the restaurant.   first two visits were stellar.  awesome sushi, one of the best sweet potato rolls i have ever eaten!  brown rice is available for the sushi, which isn't usually an option as it is hard to maintain the form of the rolls. most recent visit was disappointing.  the sakitini ordered by one of the party was pretty dreadful, we'll be sticking to beer & sake in the future. the rolls did not seem as fresh as we had remembered previously.  will likely go again, but hope the dish quality picks back up again.   also, at this recent visit, the waitstaff didn't check in or refill our water glasses.  the place was 80% empty, no really good reason why that happened. c'mon, blokes.  get it together.  we are pulling for you, as you were the most recent fave in the valley area for sushi.
My girlfriend, and I decided to test the waters at this still, relatively new, Hibachi restaurant based on the reviews posted by other "Yelpers".  I am happy to say that Kobe met, and exceeded the previously posted praise.  The outside is very deceiving.  The interior is indeed quite impressive, and nicely appointed.  I was also surprised by the size of the space, which is nicely divided into hibachi tables in the front, and a traditional set-up with booths, tables, and the bar in the back.  The staff was extremely friendly, and attentive from the moment we walked in.  Drink orders were taken quickly, and arrived just as fast..  I ordered the spicy tuna roll, and the steak/shrimp hibachi meal.  My girlfriend chose the chicken meal.   We received our miso soup, and salad almost immediately, and then I ordered the roll as an afterthought, which was no problem for the server.  Soon I had what looked like a feast in front of me, as the plates were piling up.  However, they were removed in a timely fashion, which is always a welcome point of service when I dine out.  When the roll arrived, I was surprised by the fact that the server poured my soy sauce for me.  A pleasant touch.   Then, the hibachi chef came out with his cart of goodness.  He was also extremely personable, and humorous from the get-go.  He also turned out to be a highly skilled showman, the best I've experienced infact.  He seemed to cover all of the hibachi basics, and then some.  He was also quite liberal with the sake shots.  Just have your napkin ready to catch the "overspray".  The food itself was cooked, and seasoned perfectly.  I was stuffed, but my girlfriend was really curious as to the quality of their red bean ice cream, so she ordered the un-fried version for herself.  She had no complaints.   Finally, the owner came over to introduce herself.  She gave us a card with the website, and told us there would be coupons posted there.  After that, the head server/maitre 'd (not sure what the term is in hibachi) came over to give us one of those frequent customer, punch cards which gives you a $35 gift card for every 10 visits.  All in all, they were very eager to please, and it showed throughout the experience.  We can't wait to go back with a bigger group.
Depending on which way you look at it, this will be either a fun experience or a case of customer abuse.  Let me explain. The dining experience is quite like what you would see at your local benihanas only geared more towards adults.  To give you an idea of what I mean: The chef pours sake shots into your mouth, uses a toy of a boy peeing as his main water supply to give moisture to your food, and aims projectiles of cut up zucchinis into your mouth.  And if you don't catch it like me, the chef proceeds to clonk a piece of zucchini onto your head.  Really hard.  Wait did he just do that? I wasn't sure if I should laugh or cry.  It really hurt and I felt a little offended.  Who is he to hurt me like that?  I know it was fun and games(I hope).. but really now... -_- The food I felt wasn't very fresh, but I wasn't expecting it to be.  The beef tasted a little gamey and the scallops I ordered with the meal lacked flavor.  The only redeeming part of the meal was the spicy calamari that I ordered at the beginning of my meal.  That was surprisingly really good.   Next time I want to come back to try the rolls because I am getting desperate for Asian food out here.  Not sure if I'll be doing Hibachi again, because if I get hit in the head with a zucchini again... I am not going to stand for it.
This place is beautiful inside, I was shocked honestly when we walked in. Went here for a birthday celebration with friends and had hibachi. Everything was very good, as good as you would expect from hibachi. Far better than the other hibachi places I've gone to!! I'm curious about the sushi side of the restaurant too, will have to go again!
You get the best of both worlds here! All staff members are super friendly. The sushi here is awesome and the service is very fast. The menu is clear and easy to read and prices are reasonable. The waitress recommended several sushi rolls and they were all very delicious. If sushi isn't your thing, you can always try the Hibachi. Initially, I get turned off by Hibachi because of bad prior experiences and thinking it's only for show. But at Kobe, the Hibachi is excellent. The food was great and was very fulfilling. Also, the chef is very friendly and makes the ambience so much fun. I definitely recommend!
Review for sushi/restaurant only, as I have never been to the hibachi side: Consistently excellent sushi.  I have been going to this restaurant since it's opening, and the sushi is always top shelf.  Food is fresh and delicious, presentation is beautiful, and although service is sometimes iffy/slow on a very busy night, we forgive that because the food is great.  Some of the negative reviews about this place are ridiculous and actually comical.  Give this restaurant a try.  If you really know and appreciate good food, then you will come back!
This beautiful establishment just opened about a month ago.  My husband and I went there this evening to celebrate his birthday and we were certainly glad that we did.   The owners spared no expense on the renovation of this newly remodeled space located in an older strip mall.  The interior is simply gorgeous and the design, decor and layout are very aesthetically pleasing!   A large, full tiled bar, graces the rear of the restaurant, but the owners  are still waiting to gain approval for their NYS liquor license, so no alcoholic beverages could be had.  This is typical for N.Y. Government (red-tape rigmarole) and not indicative of an unfavorable establishment. Service was delightful.  Our server was attentive, propitious, and just plain ole' cute!   The menu is extensive and reasonably priced.  We simply couldn't make our minds up as there were so many wonderful dishes to choose from no matter what your pleasure is.   The appetizers (Japanese salad, shumai, and chicken satay) were simply fabulous tasting and very elegantly presented to us in their preparation. The Chef special sushi rolls and shashimi that we ordered were also delicious and expertly assembled by the apparently highly- skilled sushi chefs stationed at the far end of the restaurant. Even the bathrooms are beautifully appointed!   Our meal was pleasantly wrapped up at the end of the night as two of the gracious female servers arrived, delivering a scrumptious birthday dessert (on the house) of generous proportions- a heaping scoop of high-quality vanilla bean ice-cream topped with light whipped cream, fresh strawberries and lightly deep fried banana points splayed around the edges of the plate and then drizzled with rich chocolate sauce!! Mmmmm-mmmm!!!   They even sang "Happy Birthday" to my hubby in Chinese!  Very cool.... It will be even better when they get their liquor license!
One of my best friends absolutely LOVES Kobe Hibachi and always suggests we go here for lunch or dinner. I want so badly to love it too so that finding a dinner spot would be easy, but I'm always reluctant. I think my main gripe with it is that I find the hibachi plates too salty. I could ask for less soy sauce, but I honestly don't think that would be the cure-all for my aversion. I tried to order a sushi plate instead on several occasions and they're often hit or miss. With that said, I think a hibachi combo is much more worth it than the maki combo. On the plus side, the chefs are always animated and love to shoot sake. When the sushi is good, it's gooood. The hibachi combos come with a side of salad and ginger dressing as well as miso or clear soup. If you get a sushi plate, it doesn't come with the sides, but you could get soup for another $2 or so. I'll probably be back again because my friend will inevitably drag me. Here's to  hoping my next sushi dinner is gooood.
I've only eaten here once, based on the recommendations of fellow Yelpers but I was very, very pleased with my overall experience.  My friend wanted to go to Osho but based on reviews and those annoying radio ads they run I refused and turned to Yelp for an alternative.  I'm glad I found Kobe.  The location is odd (in a strip mall next to the Dialysis place) but step through the doors and it has a funky metro vibe. Our server was fast and attentive.  I ordered the sweet potato sushi roll - OMG it was delicious!  It was also huge and very filling.  I ordered another dish for my entree which I didn't care for but it was my fault for not asking what was in the dish.  It was some kind of Tofu Teriyaki and it was literally an entire block of tofu cut into inch thick pieces.  It was just too much tofu and too "wobbly" of a texture.  The vegetables that it came with were fresh although the canned corn I thought was an odd addition.  Based on the previous stellar sushi roll I was able to overlook this and leave satisfied from the rice and veg from my entree. I'll be going back for sure.  The atmosphere is great.  I'll just be more careful to order something else.
Having read the previous reviews, we weren't as surprised as we might have been to find such a beautifully decorated place in the Price chopper plaza. We were at Kobe for lunch, and tried out the non-hibachi menu. Our overall impression is very positive. The four of us shared the house special "Kobe roll" -- a sumptuous roll with spicy tuna, salmon, shrimp and other stuff I forget now. We then had individual lunch portions -- one sashimi lunch platter, one sushi lunch platter, one shrimp tempura box, and one two roll combo (with spicy tuna and california roll). All excellent. The sashimi was incredibly fresh, and though the tuna nigiri in the sushi box wasn't the best, the rest was perfectly delicious. So were the other rolls. The salad and miso soup that came with the lunch orders were very fresh. One complaint. We believe we ordered the shrimp teriyaki box, not the tempura box we got. But the tempura was good as well.
Good fresh food from the hibachi side. My wife and I visit often, more than a dozen times since they opened. Kobe is our new favorite hibachi restaurant. We haven't been to the non-hibachi side. Only complaints are the lunch portions get smaller with each visit and sometimes the miso soup is bad. Love the salad dressing! The service is usually very good.  Be sure to ask for the check, otherwise they wait until you are completely finished eating before bringing it on their own. Love Izumi too, but Kobe is more convenient to us. Just a quick update: We went to Kobe last week and I ordered the lobster which turned out to be bad.  The waiter promptly offered to replace it and the new lobster was good, although flavored differently. Another waiter came by before we I got the new lobster and asked if everything was okay.  Well, no, the lobster was bad and I thought we were going to get a replacement.  At that point I asked to speak to the manager and they said it would be 25 minutes before I could speak to him/her.  At the end of dinner, I asked when the manager would come to speak to us and they said it would be another 25 minutes.   That just made no sense at all.
Food was amazing, drinks were tasty and the service was fantastic. This was our first visit to Kobe but certainly not our last. We started with the chicken lettuce wraps, which were perfect. So good, we almost ordered another order but we took the Janet, the bartender's suggestion and went with the crispy orange beef; we licked the plate clean - enough said. It was out of this world good! Just going for the food is worth it but the decor is stunning. I want to have a party in the hibatchi room. The colors, lighting and attention to details is seen throughout. I can't believe it's taken us this long to go there. Kobe is a must add to your favorite lists of restaurants. PS I hear that have 1/2 price drinks for happy hour. We'll be there soon.
My husband and I love sushi and have been to many Japanese restaurants in Poughkeepsie and New Paltz.  Kobe is by far THE best in this area.   We went for the first time last night and we will definitely go back again and again.   We order the Lobster Rock & Roll, along with other delicious dishes.  Wow!   Wow!   The waitress had come by to ask if we were set; we happily responded that we were not; we wanted to order another Lobster Rock & Roll! Oh, and the ginger dressing on the salad was heavenly......  FAR better than any other ginger dressing we've had at a Japanese restaurant. We treated ourselves to fried vanilla icecream.  In other restaurants, it is served plain - just as the fried icecream.  At Kobe, it included slices of pear, a cherry, whipped cream and a green & white swirled cookie stick.   :) The server was attentive and prompt too. Overall, we had a fantastic dining experience at Kobe.   We highly recommend this restaurant!!!!
I was hesitant to visit this restaurant due to its location in the dirty-looking price chopper plaza, tucked right between the dialysis center and liquor store. A coworker wanted to check it out for lunch and I was nothing short of stunned when we walked in. The place is simply beautiful and has a relaxed feel with modern decor. DJ Shadow's "Midnight in a Perfect World" happened to be playing when we took our seats, and this pretty much cemented my initial feelings on the ambiance There is a main dining area and a hibachi area with around six gas-powered griddles (if I am not mistaken). Both are large, and I hope the customer base will grow to fill it up. The main dining area also has a sushi bar in the back, and a well-stocked traditional bar. We opted for hibachi lunch which was very reasonable; just 10 bucks a person for chicken. The food was what you would expect from a hibachi place, and the portions were perfect. Nobody left hungry, nor too stuffed to get back in the car. The chef went easy on the salt and butter, but the taste wasn't lacking. So, I shouldn't have judged this book by its cover. I certainly hope that Kobe will gain popularity. It is very close to both my place of business and home, and look forward to many more meals there.
I come here quite often for lunch, its definitely a go-to place for me. They have a great lunch sushi special. The sushi is always very fresh, the presentation is beautiful and they are good sized. Their spicy mayo is house made and not that great, especially because they charge you for a side. When I come the service is so slow, so it's either really bad all the time or just because they're bored. You usually have to work hard to get someone's attention. Atmosphere is relaxed and pretty. Prices are good. I always have hot tea, but they do have a full bar.
My brother lives in the area and he recommended this place. It's in a nondescript strip mall and looks are deceiving, but you cannot judge a book by its cover. Exquisitely decorated on the interior with Japanese decor and a hibachi setting in the front half and a traditional restaurant in the back. We were served promptly and drinks served immediately, along with our food order.

One person in our party had severe gluten allergies, so our chef cooked using separate utensils. The sushi was good, but not the best I've had. The dinner was the best I've had. The portion was large and food was delicious. I will definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants good Japanese hibachi.

Each time I come to Poughkeepsie to visit,  this place is always my first stop. They have amazing lunch specials starting at $11 for 3 rolls and the owner is so sweet. She really goes out of her way to make her customers feel special. I love coming here and is definitely my go to sushi place! I definitely recommend trying this place out. Thanks Kobe for being so awesome.
Unlike many other reviewers, I did not know what to expect when I entered Kobe besides that several people I know had eaten there a few weeks earlier and raved about it all over facebook. I was not expecting the immaculately styled restaurant to be so large, not was I expecting such fresh quality sushi or such a good hibachi meal. Being in Manhattan, restaurants with trendy décor and Asian-inspired sushi houses are a dime a dozen, but what awaited me inside the doors of this Poughkeepsie, NY restaurant, which happens to be nestled between a dialysis center and a liquor store in a strip-center style shopping mall, was perfection. The entire restaurant is styled in tasteful décor, delightfully colored tiles and gorgeous dark wood tables and chairs. Upon entering, you walk down a long hallway with windows providing a sneak peak into a large hibachi room. Upon meeting the hostess, you are given the choice of dining in the hibachi room or a large dining room with square tables that can be configured for a party of 2 to a large party. The room has a long sleek bar with colorful pendant lights overhead and lighted tiles underneath. However, I almost missed the tiny sushi bar tucked in the back corner and my only recommendation would be that the sushi bar should have been switched with the liquor bar, to highlight the sushi better. However, since the restaurant did not have their liquor license yet, perhaps that's why the empty bar seemed so oversized in the sushi dining room. Regardless, the decorator did not forget anything and each piece, from the elaborate ceramic vases, to the carved tiles, the lighting choices, and the tables and chairs, was selected to beautifully complement each other and provide for a stylish dining experience. Even the bathrooms are magnificent with heavy carved detailed doors and tastefully chosen accessories. We chose to eat in the hibachi room and passed a Kio pond with a large statue and several potted plants. This is one of the rare Kio ponds that was not decorated in tacky fish décor or filled with dirty water. Entering the hibachi room, you pass through one of two large ornate arched entry ways. The hibachi room has 10 hibachi stations and can easily seat 75 people in total. The oversized stainless steel overhead fans above each station were an early indication that the hibachi chef's would be cooking to full power. First, I ordered a salmon and avocado sushi roll which came out perfectly tightly wrapped and cut. The salmon was fresh and the rice was extremely smooth. For our entrees, we all got hibachi, ranging from chicken, beef filet and shrimp. Prior to the main meal, a waiter served a clear broth miso-like soup and an iceberg salad with ginger dressing. James was our hibachi chef and he remembered my mom immediately from a few weeks prior. He was full of energy and took the time to welcome each guest and make them feel at home at his table. He spoke English excellent and conversed with us including asking where I was from and telling me about his trips down to Manhattan and Queens. He was witty and humorous as he cooked and had us laughing the entire time. I will not ruin it for anyone who has not been there yet but his cooking includes a very funny "prop". He offered us sake as he cooked and enjoyed squirting it in our mouths from across the table, which often resulted in it running down our chins! He also amused us with cutting a piece of broccoli into small pieces and attempting to flip it into our mouth. I could see this being uncomfortable on a date but for a family dinner, it was an enjoyable attempt that we each tried and laughed about. The entrees are served in typical hibachi style, with the rice, noodles, shrimp appetizer, vegetables and meat being placed on your plate as they are cooked. Three sauces are provided for dipping. However, the food was cooked so flavorful, but yet not salty, that the sauces were not needed. The rice started off as pile of white sticky rice and after adding an egg and some sauces, the end result was fluffy fried-rice style rice. The noodles were soft with an excellent teriyaki/soy flavor. The appetizer that accompanies each meal was flavorful, perfectly cooked juicy shrimps that melted in your mouth and left you wishing you ordered a combo meal for more shrimp! Each piece of the different fresh vegetables was cooked to its perfect crispness.  The filet was cooked as requested. The portions are huge and no one at our table was able to finish their meal. James cooked the food excellent. After clearing our plates, we were served a refreshing plate of fresh fruit including melon and oranges which was the perfect dessert to a full meal. The owner came over to ask how we enjoyed everything and everyone delightfully complemented each course, the decor and Chef James' wonderful personality.
don't let the outside fool you, this place is great, friendly service, great drinks, great selection of sake, good sushi, good soups, even if you're not a hibachi/sushi person, they have other pan-asian style options i think i have found my favorite asian restaurant in poughkeepsie
I have been to Kobe a few times and always had a good meal. This was the 1st time we did the hibachi. The chef was very entertaining. I give him 5 stars for personality. I did not care for my meal though. The calamari was like biting in rubber bands. The scallops we cook good. I could get past the rubber band calamari if there was not so much teriyaki. I will go back but won't eat at the hibachi. Will enjoy a good sit down meal in the dinning room.
Went here for hibachi lunch but then i saw that they have sushi buffet for dinner. We ordered hibachi as planned and i ordered a couple rolls from their regular menu. Hibachi was great, one of the best hibachi in the area but their sushi were not as good. I would rate 4 stars for hibachi and 1 star for their sushi.
Kobe and Akari (same owner) are hands down the best sushi places in the Hudson Valley. Out of town family looks forward to eating here. We love everything about it. The staff is great and they remember frequent visitors. The atmosphere is beautiful. And food is awesome... We've never had anything we didn't like.
Mysister picked Kobe based on the decent yelp score.  She was  severly misled.We got takeout tonight -chicken teriyaki and tofu and veg teriyaki. It is supposed to come with rice, miso soup and salad...11 for the vegetarian and 14 for the chicken. After the 15 min drive there and then 15 back, we found that they excluded the soup andsalad for both orders :( The vegetables in the vegetarian was corn (WTF??!?) and some peppers. The tofu had a teriyaki skin and was mushy, like it was silken tofu, not firm. The chicken had the corn and peppers and tomatoes (again...WTF.) Whenthe food was picked up, the hostess answered 3 phone calls before addressing me. We called about missing food and were told we would get a credit next visit, but how would they know us? No name was requested, no instructions given, no offer to provide it tonight if we drove back. We agree the food is not worth returning for anyhow. Yelp, you burned us this time.
Yikes.  Kobe was a reliable sushi joint for me when I lived in Poughkeepsie.  Visiting recently, I stopped by for a quick sashimi platter, and what a disappointment.  Yellowtail and salmon were fresh, tuna not so much.  All of the fish was room temp and mushy.  Rice had no tooth to it at all.  The whole thing was unpleasant.  What was worse, however, was the service.  Our server could not possibly have been less interested in serving us.  I flagged her over to express concern over my plate, and she left without a word, returning to fling a take-away box at me.  Time passed.  Lots of time.  We finally got up, put on our coats, and made a big deal about leaving.  We paused at the host station and finally, the server hustled over to deliver the check. And she did note that I had not brought my take-away box, so she had some level of attentiveness, just not the right way nor at the right time.
We ate dinner here on 5-17.  We wouldn't have known about this restaurant except for the restaurant.com coupon.  So glad we found this place - what a great surprise!  The restaurant looks small and rather unassuming from the front.  Once you walk the long hall, you enter a restaurant that is welcoming, sophisticated yet with enchanting decor. One room has tables and is flanked on one side with a long modern bar.  The second room has tables for those who will be eating hibachi.   From the beginning the service was appropriately attentive and friendly.  The menu offers a wide range of tempting options - something for everyone.  Yes, we started with a beer for my husband and a glass of pinot grigio for me - both reasonably priced (and the pinot was good!).  We shared a hot appetizer of Thai chicken spiced lettuce wraps.  Highly recommend.  There were four, served beautifully and tasting even better.   I ordered the sushi deluxe which was fresh and artistically presented.  My husband ordered the orange beef that was also attractively served and of course tasted delicious.  The small bite sized beef was tender and seasoned well.  Our server was properly attentive and a recent graduate of the CIA.  We will be back.  The food and selection is outstanding, the atmosphere lovely and the staff professional.  Great addition to Poughkeepsie.
This was a fantastic dining experience!!! The sushi & sashimi was extremely fresh and artfully served. The atmosphere was comfortable and this is a very family friendly environment. I can't wait to go back and enjoy some more. Worth every penny!!!
This place is fantastic despite the crappy location!  The mango salad for a starter is out of this world.... I highly recommend this for a romantic dinner and or a casual lunch.  I'll be going back soon.
We went to Kobe on recommendation from a fellow "yelper". We went with an open mind and felt confident that we can "rate" this place as we cook and eat Asian cuisine 3 or 4 days a week. We didn't have sushi but chicken and shrimp dishes with a request of extra spicy for each dish. The food came out great. Only next time we'll request for double or triple spiciness. The food comes close to what you get from Asian homes. Will definitely go back when we are in the area.
A beautiful restaurant in a mundane strip mall. Hibachi is better than most in the area. Service is great and very attentive. Definitely will be back to try the other Asian selections and sushi. Kids had a blast as they are very friendly and cater to everyone.
My boyfriend and I had a wonderful dinner last night at Kobe. We ate in the dining room and we were impressed with everything from the food, to the decor, to the service. We ordered the sushi and sashimi dinner for two. The fish was as fresh as it gets and the amount of it was remarkable. It was the best sushi we have had in the Hudson Valley yet. We also ordered the pork gyozas as an appetizer and fried ice cream for dessert which we were also delighted with. We will definitely be going back soon.
We are from out of town and thought this was an amazing find. Food was fresh service was right on. Bill was very reasonable and the feeling was great. Recommended highly'
Really great food , service and atmosphere. Excellent variety from Japanese , hibachi,Chinese, Thai.... All delicious.  Classy atmosphere. Two rooms one for hibachi and regular dining room.
Great sushi and chicken Yaki udon. Salad dressing fantastic. Miso soup good but came out lukewarm. Low sodium soy sauce available. Decor magnificent. The service was a little slow during lunch time but maybe because the staff was intrigued by the summer Olympics on the tv. I highly recommend this restaurant.
Very good! Vegetable rolls are great! Good soup as well !
