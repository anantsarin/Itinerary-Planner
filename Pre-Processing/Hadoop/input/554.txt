I had one of the best massages of my life at Spa at 500!   The facilities are wonderful - quiet, calming and clean.  I highly recommend relaxing in the hot tub before your massage - it's a couple extra bucks but totally worth it!   And Angela is wonderful!  She asked where my pain was and really focused on what I wanted.  The massage was pure heaven!
