Awesome place. Great facial and massage. Don't bother going anywhere else cause this is the best.
A wonderful relaxing way to spend some time. I wish we could have stayed longer.
I just happened upon this place at a local festival while on vacation. Yes yes they were running a spa day deal!  Super nice people, peaceful space, they relaxed us, rubbed us and made us glow!
Very nice spa. I had a massage with Nick.  Did a great job and was very nice. I recommend this spa.
Almost a week after my fantastic spa day there, I'm still reeling from it. I'm calm, cool, and composed, not to mention, my skin is still baby soft! The ladies there are fabulous, are amazing at their craft, and keep the goodness flowing. It's the perfect way to pamper yourself. So, do it ASAP.
What a great place; and so convenient! Hands-down, best facial I've ever had!!! Awesome massage and mani-pedi as well. Such a friendly staff and their prices are very reasonable. I would definitely recommend that anyone living in or visiting the area treat themselves to a relaxing, uplifting experience here!
This spa is a lovely place to unwind and relax.  I have had two facials and am going back for more.  Gladys explains each thing she is putting on you and my face has never been so soft.  I am happy to have found her.  I will keep returning while I am in Florida.
Amazing is perfect name for this upscale salon.  I had a mani-pedi.  Very relaxing atmosphere with soothing music.  I will be back every year on vacation. If you live here treat yourself more often.  Reasonable prices.
