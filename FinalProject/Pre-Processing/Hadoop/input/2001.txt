I've visited The Screening Room a few times and I can't explain how cool a place it is, but I'm going to try! Think of the coolest movie you've ever watched with a group of friends. Comfy chairs. Popcorn. Beer/wine/soda/ whatever. Now grow that room five or ten times over seating wise. That's what the screening room has. It's your living room only bigger, better, and with popcorn you didn't have to pop! My most recent trip was to watch the American release of an anime I'm a fan of, but before that I've stopped in to see a lovely presentation of "It's a Wonderful Life." They are not a cineplex that shows films on dozens of screens every twenty minutes. They are a single screen that shows amazing movies most nights (check their schedule). The Screening Room is a great little theater that shows everything from classic films to fresh new niche releases. The prices are so affordable that it's a great night out on any budget. In addition, the staff is amazing. This is LITERALLY one of Buffalo's best kept secrets. It's tucked behind a dance studio, an Asian food market, and tucked around the LEFT side of a public services office. When you find it know that you've earned yourself a great treat!
Most unique theatre experience in Buffalo.  The seating has the feel of a true screening room, not a theatre.  Plus they serve beer which should not be overlooked.   Plus, despite playing mostly older movies,  they seem to have their finger on the pulse of the industry.  I went for a one night only screening of a music documentary called As The Palaces Burn.  No one else in the area was playing it.  Fully recommend it.
What a great place! My wife and I just saw our first movie here and loved it. Great atmosphere, great price. Can't wait to go back!

Do you ever get resentful that we don't have as many cool spots to watch movies as some of our neighboring cities (cough Rochester or Toronto?). Sure, we have locally-owned Dipson Theaters, but they don't even serve wine or beer, let alone have tables and comfy chairs for you to sit at. And while going to the Dipson Theaters surely beats catching a flick at Regal, it's tough to be crazy about it when you've experienced such fantastic movie watching experiences in neighboring cities. Well guess what? I am now brimming with pride for Buffalo's movie theaters once again. Ever since The North Park closed down (and I can't wait to see what they do with it once it reopens), I've just been a bit bummed. Is it so much to ask to enjoy a nice movie in a laid-back comfortable environment? Well this little Cafe, which by the way is probably run by your grandparents (please be sure to thank them and make sure you take over this business when they don't want to do it anymore, because it is SUCH a gem!) delivers! Tucked and hidden away in a plaza in Amherst, you wouldn't know this place exists. What does it promise? Old flicks for true movie lovers, low prices and the feeling that you're going to watch a movie in a friends house. My fiancé and I went there this past Saturday night to catch Breakfast at Tiffany's. It cost $5 to watch the movie. A bucket of popcorn cost $4. Tea with unlimited refills was like $1 each. We didn't get any beer or wine, but plenty of people were enjoying libations at little tables set up around the room. Our total bill for two for one of the nicest dates we've had seeing a movie was like $14. Cost-value aside, there's a community feeling here that is priceless. You need to experience it for yourself. Check their web site for movies that are playing and come snuggle with your SO or bring your friends and enjoy a fine night. If you're coming on a weekend, be sure to get here at least 10-15minutes early if you want to find a seat at a table or come even earlier. Otherwise, you'll be stick in a bar stool in the back somewhere (which is where we were, but it was still really comfortable). Love this place!

I went to the Screening Room for their Sci-Fi movie night, and I was wildly impressed (enough that I went back the following evening for a regular screening). The price is definitely right. For a double feature of Gattaca and The Day the Earth Stood Still (the original) it cost just $10... $8 for me since I found out about it through Meetup. When I came the following evening for Murder on the Orient Express the tickets were just $5 each. A tub of popcorn is $3.75, a far cry from the Regal or AMC where a large popcorn is running somewhere in the neighborhood of $10.   Other reviewers were right that it's hard to find. I think it's particularly tricky because when I read "Northtown Plaza" I assumed it was part of the shopping plaza, but there is a separate business plaza off to the side. The Screening Room is probably accessed most easily by turning into the parking lot on Bailey. The decor is cute. There is a row of comfy-looking chairs in the front with tables and standard chairs lined up behind it. The walls are decorated with old movie posters and lights, and there is a concession stand tucked in the back corner. I've been back a few times, and each time I'm a little more impressed.

THIS PLACE!  THIS PLACE!!!  This has to be one of the best places in the Buffalo area, hands down.  I have seen three movies here over the years and I absolutely loved it.  This place is a cafe cinema (meaning you get to sit at tables and order food/drinks while you watch a movie) so it is already unique.  The staff is so friendly and the people are really cool.  I don't remember the price (you can check their website) but I remember it being pretty cheap for just movie tickets.  They show the best old movies like Hitchcock movies or Casablanca (every Valentine's Day).  This is definitely a must-go if you like movies at all. A final point: One thing I worried about was that this place would be filled with "movie snobs".  You know, those people that go see old movies and then say things like "ohh yes that in fact was a 1936 AeroStar sea plane not a 1938 Windmark sea plane as the movie makes it out to be, yuck yuck yuck..." and then stares at you for not knowing this simple fact.  But, in fact, the place is filled with friendly regular people who just want to enjoy a movie.  I like that.  A lot.

The Screening Room is one of Buffalo's hidden treasures--even a lot of lifetime Buffalo residents are surprised to hear about it. Nestled in a former dance studio in a side-lot at a largely abandoned plaza, finding the place can be a bit tricky (but, hey--there's plenty of parking!). It's well worth the expedition, however. As you enter the spacious venue, decked out with decades of movie memorabilia, you'll be directed to a counter that serves as the box office. From there, head in and pick your spot amidst the cafe and banquet tables, a few wing-back chairs (extra comfy) and some bona fide theater seats up front. Shows fill up quickly on weekends, so if you want the best seat in the house, show up early. With you seat selected, it's time to head over to the concession counter--where you'll find not just popcorn, candy, and soft drinks, but also a nice selection of beer and wine. (Yay!) From there, you can just sit back and enjoy the film. Most often, you'll find classic movies on their schedule, but they also host plenty of special events--art films, short film festivals, anime, etc. There's really something for everyone. It's always a great experience coming to the Screening Room. The folks who run it are as nice as can be--it seems to be a family operation with multiple generations often on hand. The atmosphere is warm and relaxed. Additionally, the projection quality and sound are very good, making the movie-watching experience a true pleasure!

This is the most amazing new place I have been to and will definitely be back for future screenings very soon. The atmosphere is intimate, relaxed, warm lit and the people who work there are just too kind and very nice. If you are paying with a card, they open up a tab for you to take over to the snack area where they keep your tab till the end and can take it back over to the main desk where they cash you out. They have delicious popcorn with huge portions for the price and great drinks, they serve alcohol. Next time, I am going to try one of their ice cream Pomegranate Wine Float Drinks, my friend had their Orange Creamsicle Drink with Champage or Wine and she loved it. I saw the movie "Niagara" with Marilyn Monroe and the screen was great quality and everyone is very respectful when the movie starts rolling. Get there early and snag the theatre style seats or sit at a table, whichever suits your taste. This is an incredibly unique, vintage energy screening room and will definitely be back!

One of my favorite things about Buffalo is all the little hidden gems waiting to be discovered.  The Screening Room is a prime example. Tucked away in a nondescript plaza, this cinema is the perfect setting for a cozy, comfy viewing of a classic film.  The "cafe" feel is awesome.  Order wine (nothing fancy) for $18/bottle and about $4/glass or a beer ($3 for domestic, $4 for premium).  The popcorn is really inexpensive as well. The setting is absolutely adorable and comfortable.  The walls are covered with movie posters yet feels the opposite of cluttered.  There are tables throughout the room with chairs and there are a couple couches for more comfortable seating. Staff is really friendly and obviously excited that you've decided to check them out. Their film selection is great and they keep their online calendar up to date.  I caught an Alfred Hitchcock film, "Rope," which I had never seen before.  This place is the perfect setting for classic films. I can't wait to go back and tell all my friends about this place.  Consider this for a unique date idea, especially if your date appreciates quality, classic movies.

Outside the cafe, An older gentlemen is writing the title of the ONE movie they are showing, while listening to his grandson chat with him. He opens the door to the entryway hall and invites me politely inside. I am there early - and wander looking at the walls of pictures of private events that look (appropriately) a bit outdated, but fun and unique. When I walk in, jazz music is playing in a room cluttered with tables and chairs and some fun looking red pleather(?) couches. There is a concession stand stocked with - besides the usual movie theater fair - wine, beer, hot chocolate, and coffee as well as some specialty drinks, which I can't really comment on since I stuck to a bottle of water this time. I love that it's available though, it just adds to the uniqueness of the Screening Room experience. Basically, at this point - I know whatever happens next I have fully romanticized this place and fallen in love The cluttered room does not serve to be a problem for my friend who happens to use a wheelchair - the staff quickly asks us for our table preference and moves a couple of chairs out of the way. When the movie starts the cafe is silent other then a few snacks being munched and movie reactions. The crowd here is, like the movie selection, made for true film lovers. We are all there to really SEE this movie. The movies they show at this theater are classics (they are doing a Hitchcock series now) and new movies you will most likely not see anywhere else. I was in heaven! The only downside to the Screening room, for me - is the location. Arriving at Northtown plaza on a Tuesday night, looking for a rather non-descript building amongst closed retail super centers was a bit tough. I wish they were in a location easier to reach for an urban-dweller. However, it is definitely worth the trek at least once in awhile for a great movie experience... I just hope the suburbanites around the area appreciate having this theater in their neighborhood as much as I would!

Where have you been hiding all my life? This cinematic experience in the form of a coffee house is truly one of the most enjoyable times I've ever had. I stumbled across this place while reading ArtVoice's movie section. The Screening Room was showing How to Marry a Millionaire with Marilyn Monroe, Betty Grable, and Lauren Bacall for $5 admission. I adore Marilyn Monroe and have always wanted to experience one of her films on the big screen. At first I thought it would just be a small theater, but after looking through some of their pictures it was set up like a cafe which I was skeptical about which I'll get into later. The Screening Room specializes in classic and foreign films. They show two different films every night and some nights they'll allow you to stay for both at the cost of one. Their admission changes based on the type of films they're showing which is understandable. The only criticism I have about allowing patrons to stay for both films in one night is to at least have some cohesiveness between the films. Somebody who wants to go see a Marilyn Monroe film may not want to stay and watch an Alfred Hitchcock film. The Screening Room also allows you to host private events there which is pretty neat if you want to have a birthday party screening. Screen your favorite film and have a mini party. Now for my personal experience. Like I mentioned above, I was a tad skeptical about the whole cafe feel. Wouldn't it be crowded? How would we be able to see the screen? I was a little nervous. When I arrived my worries instantly vanished. The decor was all classic Hollywood. The walls were littered with classic film posters, movie lights, film reels, it fit the mood perfectly. The tables and chairs were spaced out very well that if all the chairs were filled, people in the front row could sneak by without squeezing through. In terms of the screen, it was a good size. The screen was raised above, like a drive-in, so there were no worries about people's heads getting in the way. As I sat there watching Marilyn Monroe grace the screen, it was like looking up into the stars. Watching these beautiful ladies shine bright again on the big screen, there were no words to describe the amazement! Moving onto their menu! I took one look at the menu and was quite shocked at the assortment they offer. You can order an entire bottle of wine for your table, pour yourself a glass, sit back, relax, and enjoy the film. What other place allows you to do such an awesome thing like that?! Aside from that they offer beer, your choice of soda, water, tea, and a drink I instantly fell in love with over the name itself. Café Casablanca, a warm apple cider served with a cinnamon stick. Any classic film fan will instantly understand the reference and I personally fangirled out! (Fangirl - A fan, sometimes also called aficionado or supporter, is a person with a liking and enthusiasm for something.) Finally, the location. When I said, "Where have you been hiding all my life?" I meant literally. It took me two days to actually find out where this place was located. It's located in the Northtown Plaza on the corner of Sheridan Rd & Bailey Ave. At first you'd think it would easy to find, nope! I drove around the entire plaza a handful of times just to finally find it located in the furthest corner, behind another building, and next to some dumpsters. There was a small sign on the wall next to the door saying "The Screening Room" which initially led to my skepticism. A couple signs and arrows would help wonders in finding this place. I don't know if they're deliberately trying to hide this place, but if that's their intensions they're doing a pretty good job at it! Once you find out where it is, everything else is smooth sailing. Here's the "too long, didn't read" version. If you're a fan of classics/foreign films, this place is for you. The menu provides a variety of items. The cost of admission is quite reasonable, but depends on what you see. If you've never been here before, do your research first and leave a little bit early to find it. The Screening Room represents one of those hidden little gems in Buffalo that you'll completely fall in love with. I can't say enough good things about this place! To look up their upcoming films and showtimes go to their website (screeningroom.net) It's definitely a place worth experiencing!
I went to Screening Room for my first time last night to see Evangelion 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo. I had no idea what to expect, and I was pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere is very quaint, with a café type setting. Concessions were also very reasonable price wise. I can't wait for another screening that would pique my again. I will be looking for as many reasons as I can to go back.

Get here early! First come first serve. Some nice wingback chairs if you can grab them. Nicest family runs this and has for years. Old(er) movies on the big screen with wine, beer, soda, water, food and snacks. Affordable and just plain fun!

The owners let us in very early because it was cold outside.  They told us to grab a seat anywhere and they'd get our ticket later.  After the movie they invited us to stick around and watch more movies.  How friendly can you be?!  To boot, their concessions are actually normal prices.  $1.75 for a bottle of water.  They also have beer and wine.  I live over 3 hours away from this place and I'm excited to go back.
