Always good all the time...savoring pizzas at a not hurt ur pockets price..its good to know that something awesome exists right next to a not so friendly state farm store.
Worst customer service i have ever encountered. Piss poor! Thank you for ruining my night. Will never order again nor recommend! Â Beyond rude.
Great pizza, including a killer white pizza. Good sausage and spinach rolls. Surprisingly great Italian sub! And free delivery. What else can I say? 5 stars.
Thin Crust!!! From NY I like my pizza with a thin crust. This Bizzarro has great pizza and it was ready to pickup with-in 20min. Staff was friendly and the pizza was a good price. Will go back.
Being from NY, I'm definitely going to be super-judgemental about pizza outside the state. Fortuntately, the pizza is terrific! The wings were awesome too. You can't beat the prices here. Very friendly waitstaff, and turns out one of the girls is from NY.
Best pizza by far!!!!
The toppings are good, but the crust is rubber. Expect a sore jaw after a few slices.
