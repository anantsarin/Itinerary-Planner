I started training in Tai Chi at a later point in my life.  What I've found is that tai chi enhances most aspects of my daily life.  Specifically, my balance and coordination have improved allowing me to do other sports with more confidence and success.  My other sports include cycling and skiing.  In addition, the Qigong practice helps me with calmness, clear thinking and patience as I go through each day.  I highly recommend the Chinese Martial Arts Academy because of the experience, caring and kindness of the people who provide teaching there.  It is a very friendly and homey environment for all.
