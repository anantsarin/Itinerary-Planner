As good as it gets!!!   Yes, it is!!  My manager at work visits La Bella Grand Salon and it is a satisfied customer. She had handed me a card with Paula's name and told me to go, that I would like her.  She was so right!! The salon is open, homey and clean. I was able to get an appointment for following day, which I thought it was wonderful as I needed a haircut desperately. I got there at 10:00 am and Paula was ready for me. She greeted me in a way that I felt very comfortable and at home.  Chat for a bit about my hair, what I was looking for, etc. Washed hair and back on chair. She did an awesome job and I felt such relief after she asked me to please let her know what I liked and what not.   I had a great experience, and excellent haircut and now I have a hair stylist for the time I will stay in Syracuse.  I am very happy! I left happy, love my haircut. Thank you Paula, from bottom of my heart.
