Getting ready for the 6x6 at RoCo Art Gallery I went in looking for specific supplies.  While I was able to find most of them one particular type of paint they did not carry.  Luckily for me the cashier, a kind elderly woman, was kind enough to call around town to save me countless trips.   Unfortunately we couldn't find the paint here in Rochester, what she did next earned the five stars.  She went online found three companies that carried the paint and delivered.  The entire process took less than fifteen minutes.  Great service, knowlegeable staff, plenty of stock on hand, and reasonable pricing.  I would  recommend them to anyone.
This place is awesome. They have everything you can think of and some things you've never seen before. Supplies for all medias and levels. Prices are reasonable with some things on sale frequently. Helpful staff and a sort of chaotic environment that I actually like in an art store. It means they would rather have a lot of inventory for customers to choose from, than lean it out and make everything neat. Having recently moved downtown, this is an obvious addition to my go-to art supply store.
I lost my favorite little travel watercolors and went berserk trying to find them to no avail.  The place that used to carry them around here no longer does and it was not easy to find them online...until I found Rochester Art Supplies.  No sooner had I placed an order than they appeared in my mailbox...ok, it took a couple of days, but who's counting when they're traveling 3000 miles and I didn't specify faster shipping.  If I am ever in Rochester, I will make this store my first stop.
