This is the only true gym in Syracuse. I worked out here in the 90s and at the time was run by a guy named Joe. Call what you want muscle head gym juice gym, these guys came to battle every day and night. There was no bullshitting here. There were no tvs, no extras to make you feel "comfortable", it was a dark dungy hardcore gym. So if you looking to really train this is the place.
This is a muscle head gym.  I started working out here when it was moving from a downtown (North Side) location.  The new location was kind of cramped at first.  The owner was making modifications and adding equipment as funding permitted. This place is all about the weights.  A powerlifters paradise. Parking is kind of tight
