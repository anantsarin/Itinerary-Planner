This is such a great boutique shop in the heart of a quaint little town!  Whenever I go shopping, I seek out places just like this.  They have a bit of everything and are extremely helpful if you need it.
I had a hard time not buying out this whole shop. I had no idea it existed in Pittsford until hearing about it from a friend. I found some great Christmas gifts here, and was happy to support a local shop to boot. They have something for everyone, including the men in your life. There's a back room dedicated to the gents. It's a well-rounded albeit small collection to choose from -- quality socks, ties, leather wallets, button down shirts, casual-wear, and sweaters. Then, for the ladies, there's the motherlode. They have everything -- they cater to the young and older crowds without seeming disjointed. Everything blends well together, some pricier items like the Michael Stars tees, but also offering a nice selection of jeans and amazing purses. I think I found at least three that I had to have. Sadly, I resisted, but I know when I'm in the market for a new bag, I'll be back. (That large green one is still calling to me...) Their jewelry selection is lustworthy. I spent a solid 15min. riffling through their basket of silver rings (price ranged $25-35). I also picked out an amazing purple gem necklace on a delicate chain for my mom. They have some nice statement pieces too. Scour as you wish. I'll be back for more!
I like boutique shopping and this is one of my favorites. They have a little bit of everything- leather clutches and purses, womens clothing,  a lot of unique jewelery, great men's button down shirts, and some home goods. If you are in Pittsford, stop in!
I love this boutique. It has a little bit of everything and they are very friendly. Give yourself time to really look around, it is bigger than you think and so much fun stuff!
