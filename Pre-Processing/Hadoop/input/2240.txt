If you want a yummy Italian meal in Ithaca, ZaZa's is definitely the place to go. The restaurant offers a wide variety of pasta, meat, and seafood options, and the cocktails are great, too! On a recent visit to ZaZa's during AppleFest (when other restaurants had hour-long waitlists), the hostess was able to seat us immediately. She even offered us free dessert when we volunteered to move to a smaller table to accommodate a larger party. For great service and a delicious meal, I suggest ZaZa's.
My first time at Zazas! Absolutely amazing!! Not only was the food amazing but our waiter (Kyle) was hands down the best service I have ever received! Kyle was very knowledgable, attentive, and made us feel very welcome! I will surely be back again soon!
Pretty decent food. I've only had takeout from here, so I can't comment beyond that, but I did enjoy what I got. Plus they supplied well-prepared ciabatta rolls, which will automatically earn you a star in my book. My husband enjoyed his food, as well. One thing, though: ZaZa's, please use a font other than Papyrus on your menus. I can take the Times New Roman, but Papyrus? That makes me a bit sad.
Wonderful Italian restaurant. Exterior is not inviting but go inside. Nice decor, great service and good food. Wine list was good. We both had an enjoyable evening.
Good food, good service , good atmosphere. I was there during Cornell University's graduation and the menu was a special graduation menu. Not sure how it differed from their regular menu but everything was delicious! Service was excellent for our large group which always makes any dining experience that much better. I would come back if I'm ever in the Ithaca area again for sure.
This has got to be the classiest restaurant in Ithaca.  Okay I admit my experience is limited but this place is well decorated and the service is that of a more upscale restaurant.  The food wasn't good, hence the stars, but the staff was friendly and very helpful with introducing the menu.  I had the shrimp and lobster risotto.  The shrimp and lobster were good and the risotto tasted undercooked.  Overall the dish was salty.  We had the mozarella cheese with tomatos and balsamic reduction.  This was delicious and I recommend it for an appetizer.  There are only three pieces of cheese though and four slices of tomato.  But the crust was very crispy and the cheese was melted.  My brother ordered the special of the night which was blue snapper.  Apparently this tastes just like regular snapper but is slightly larger.  This was flavored with lemon and herbs and the dish came with vegetables. The artichoke was delicious and the fish was very tender and not that fishy.  I would give this place 3.5 stars.   btw the parking lot is tiny! there were parking spaces but it's difficult to back up.  luckily we had a micro sized rental car. Sidenote, ZaZa's has gift certificates.
My boyfriend and I were visiting the Finger Lakes for the first time for our anniversary and we picked ZaZa's for dinner based on its Yelp rating and the recommendations from the wineries we visited.  We had our expectations pretty high but it was AMAZING. We got there pretty early.. 5pm because we just finished up visiting wineries so we were among the first people there.  We asked if we could sit by the fireplace and they kindly seated us there, splitting a table of 4 in 2 and they lit the candle on the table for us.  The restaurant was beautiful. We ordered the smoked salmon bruschetta as an appetizer and it was perfect.  There was so much salmon it was hanging over the bread.  It also came with a little bit of salad on the side.   I ordered a penne pasta with red sauce, sausage, spinach, and mushrooms.  The red sauce was so great.  I think the sauce is what won me over with this place.  Second was the salmon bruschetta.  My boyfriend got veal parm entree.  He asked to swap out the mashed potato with extra veggies.  His meal also came with the same red sauce and he agreed the sauce was perfect.  He didn't think the combo of veal-string beans-mashed potatoes made sense but he thought it was good nonetheless. I should also note that we went to Maxie's Supper Club and Oyster Bar the night before and this place was much better in comparison.  About the same price but you felt like you were getting more for your money.   The next time we go to the Finger Lakes we would absolutely go to ZaZa's.
ZaZa's is a decent choice if you need to satisfy your craving for overpriced italian food.  The ambiance has a sort of "converted office building" feel that the animal print decor just can't hide.  Service is good here and it is one of the few options in town where you can seat large groups at a single table.  Overall, I think there are better options in town for a nice classy dinner, but it'll do if you're craving cucina italiana.
Refined, authentic, Italian food. I've been to ZaZa's several times, and all and all I think it does traditional Italian food well. Their risotti and gelati are fantastic, and I am always intrigued by their antipasti! I only had one less than great experience - when I ordered the Veal Milanese, which I felt was over cooked.  The ambience is classy but comfortable.
One of the best places in Ithaca!
One of few fine dining experience at Ithaca Try a lobster risotto :))
Best date night spot in town.  The food is delicious, the ambiance is romantic, and the staff is very proffessional and courteous.  The menu is very extensive so it's hard to decide what to get since everything looks amazing so check out the menu before you go!  They have a full bar and an extensive drink menu.   My husband and I come here for birthdays, anniversary's and celebrations.  It's pricey but worth every penny.  We've been blown away by the homemade pasta, fresh marinara and all their seafood.  My favorite drink is the Dark and Stormy (with fresh ginger) - give it a try, the bartenders are magicians.
Very professional staff, very good pasta selections with lots of mushrooms and tartufi!!
3.5.. For Ithaca, I'd give it a 4 (Ithaca sympathy points). For a big city, I'd give it a 3. We came here last April for an anniversary dinner after reading the Yelp reviews. Zaza's is a lovely establishment in Ithaca, makes you forget that you are there. There is a convenient parking lot and the atmosphere is classy. We ordered the duck breast and rack of lamb. Both were very good, nothing mind blowing. Prices were fair as well.
the restaurant is much bigger than it feels from outside. the dome is interesting. food never disappoint me and they are big portion, leftover is good for a next day lunch. considering that, price is very reasonable.
Parking good Atmosphere good The tv in the bathroom was a bit strange So we're the plastic chairs. The bread is delish and the champagne I got on special was delicious too and well priced. The calamari was ok.   Kind of rubbery. Mushroom ravioli was good and the red sauce was good too. I was disappointed that I could not get any meat sauce based products as I don't eat veal and they put it in all their meat items.   Lemon tart was good, It was ok food decent but nothing that makes me say "I need to go back there"
Maybe I ate at the wrong place but this was NOT as good as some of these reviews made it sound. Portions were pretty small (that's fine for fine dining) but the food itself just wasn't that good. A caesar salad at and italian place should be A++ and it just tasted OK. I had the scallop appetizer and also tasted the fried mozzarella appetizer. Both had such a thick layer of breading it was like eating things from the frozen section. You can still have something be fried and keep it classy, it doesn't need to have a concrete wall of breading to taste good. I had the special which turned out to be a decent piece of sea bass smothered in cream (lemon aioli) and butter on top of some rice pilaf and 6 (yes 6) green beans. The plate looked like a snow storm. White plate, white rice, white fish, white sauce. It was so unappetizing and looked like Top Chef's worst nightmare. So heavy and bland. Jeez, mix it up a little bit with some color and flavor. What a waste. Want to know the best part, it cost me $25! Unless it's really desperate, I will not be back.
Za Za's is unexpectedly posh.  The layout of the place is very cool - it's all housed on one floor with a recessed central seating area and a "border" of tables around the periphery.  The atmosphere is hip and the colors are rich.   Lots of cocktails.  Lots and lots of specialty cocktails.  They are a bit expensive, even for the yuppie parts of Ithaca.  The waitress knew her wines by the glass, too.  When my husband wanted something they were out of, she could give informed counsel.  It wasn't just, like, "Uh, no more of the Cab.  Pick another red?  I think Merlot is red.  Let me check on that, actually." I got the duck.  It was amazing.  I ate everything.  (Portions are large-ish but not insane.) Go.  It's good.  Nice place to hang out, busy and bustly, but somehow not as frenetic as Madeline's can sometimes seem.  Maybe it's that layout thing.
Absolutely love this place.  My fiance and I went there based on a recommendation from a friend so we were looking forward to trying out a date night place where we would feel a little bit more comfortable dressing up to go to.  The decor is warm and inviting but still refined.  We enjoyed it so much that we went back a second time a month later in a town full of restaurants! The first time we went, we tried the fried calamari and mussels in a broth sauce for apps.  The calamari pretty good but nothing compared to the mussels.  The calamari was pretty basic; you can get it at pretty much any good Italien restaurant.  They cook their mussels perfectly and the broth is heavenly.  I'm pretty sure that if it were allowed, my fiance would have taken the bowl of broth and and drank it!  Fortunately, he was able to restrain himself and use his spoon to finish all the broth.  After that we got the veal paillard and gnocchi bolognese.  Let's just put it this way, when we came back for a second time we got the same meals.  And while I've been known to repeat meals (at almost every restaurant we go to...) he has never done this with me and we've been together for five years!  We have yet to try dessert-we've been too full at the end of the meal!
My father took me here for dinner when I was last in town, more so because, he and I could not figure out what was going to sound good. Once we were seated, there was a big of confusion with our Server vs. Host on who was doing what. My father and had the Chef's tasting special, and that consisted of: Amuse Bouche Hearts of Palm with Tabbouleh  - Wicked yummy from what I could steal. Soup Course Mediterranean Seafood Bouillabaisse- Still dreaming of this dish, and I do not like seafood. Starter Course Beef carpaccio - At this point, I may have ordered the wrong meal. Meat Course Pomegranate marinated rack of lamb, served over a lentil and sweet potato ragout - Really good Lamb, served over polenta, as my Father does not care for Sweet Potato. Dessert Course Fresh fig baklava - It looked wonderful, but I did not have any. I had the Pappardelle with wild mushrooms, mascarpone cheese, and white truffle oil with a Caesar salad.  The salad was just what you would expect, nothing to write home about. The pasta was more broken up noodles than long pieces, but very tasty regardless of presentation! All and all, amazing food! I would defiantly go back.
Yum.  Definitely a favorite.  The lasagna is DIVINE.  Simply lovely texture with the bechamel, delicious meat, perfect sauce.  The mushroom risotto is absolutely delicious. Service is impeccable.  Each server is incredibly friendly, gracious, and seems happy to be there.  This really stands out and makes the whole experience that much more enjoyable.  The complimentary bread and oil/sundried tomatoes that is placed on each table is delicious, and the servers have even brought around seconds of it when I have dined with a group of friends here. Decor is lovely.  I think this used to be an old movie rental store?  Those days are in the past!  You'd never guess from the outside how romantic it is on the inside.  I have had such a great time with a group of friends here laughing and chatting, and have also been on amazing dates here. Five stars!  LOVE this place, would recommend it to anyone!  Can't wait to go back!
I have been to ZaZa's about 10 times and I have always left very satisfied. The food and service are always very good, but I feel there is a few more small things that can be done to get that final star. As far as the interior goes, I don't think there is a place in Ithaca, or almost anywhere else, that can compare to ZaZa's. The dining room layout is very unique with the sunken center and large columns and curtains. The lighting and color scheme adds elements of refinement that works with the rest of the decor. The kitchen is open to the dining room with a large mural painted above the opening. The only thing I would change are the seats. They are somewhat hard and uncomfortable plastic chairs. The service has always been excellent. Whether is calling in to make a reservation or checking in at the front of house I have always felt welcome and appreciated. The servers are reasonably knowledgeable about the food and drinks being served. When I ask for recommendations, they elaborately describe the dish's ingredients and flavors, rather than just saying "this dish is good". Now on to the best part of ZaZa's, the food. I have had most of the menu over the course of my visits. As far as appetizers I have had the sliced fennel, artichokes, polenta, scallops, calamari, prosciutto, and buffalo mozzarella. While all the appetizers were good,  I thought the scallops and polenta were exceptional. The polenta's creaminess and the mushroom's meaty texture played well with the garlic and thyme with the truffle subtly hanging out in the background. The scallop was perfectly cooked and fantastically tender. The fried crust was a great segue from the scallop to the bacon. I have had the veal parmesan, saltimbocca, gnocchi with cheese sauce, frutti di mare bianco, and lobster and shrimp risotto. However, the most memorable dishes are the pumpkin ravioli and the wild mushroom ravioli. The fresh pasta encases a good proportion of filling but not so much that it explodes or leaves you wondering where the filling is. The pumpkin ravioli is dressed in a beautiful sauce with a hit of amaretto that is a great compliment to the pumpkin spices. The mushroom ravioli with the walnut sauce gives a smoky earthiness that ties the dish together. The only criticisms I have of individual dishes are about the lobster risotto and gnocchi. The lobster ravioli uses only claw meat, not the more tender and delicious tail meat that I prefer. The cheese used in the gnocchi sauce may have been heated to high and made it a bit grainy. Another consistent flaw in the food is that I feel the dishes are undersalted. Salt is the most crucial ingredient that is most noticeable when left out. However, I would rather have to add some salt to my dish, rather than send it back for being too salty. Overall, I am very satisfied with my experiences at ZaZa's. I will continue to go to ZaZa's for great Italian food in one of the most impressive dining rooms you can find anywhere. If you go there, you will not be disappointed!
Best Italian place in town. The price is medium ranged, not so expensive considering the quality of the food and service you get. My favorite dishes are the lobster risotto and veal parmesan.
ZaZa's is one of my absolute favorite restaurants in Ithaca. My rating of it is between a 4 and 5 stars, as I've been here now four times and have had slightly different experiences every time. It's owned by my Italian professor and her husband (who was also the brains behind Thai Cuisine, Madeline's and Mia). The first time, I was absolutely blown away by the food. The seared tuna with a peppercorn crust, green beans with a balsamic reduction and saffron polenta...insanely good. The pennette with sausage and gorgonzola cream sauce was possibly even better. My boyfriend and I didn't speak the whole meal because we were both too busy stuffing our faces. Which would have been awkward, except it was a few days before Valentine's Day and the couples on either side of us also weren't speaking (but it seemed like they were actually fighting...yikes). Second time, we brought my sister, who was in town. Got the mind-blowing tuna again, as well as a lobster and shrimp risotto (good, a little heavy/greasy toward the end) and pappardelle bolognese (decent, but mediocre in comparison). Third time, pappardelle with wild mushrooms, truffle oil and mascarpone cheese. Catapulted ZaZa's back to a 5-star restaurant for me...and then the other entree, the seafood pasta with red sauce, just ruined it. It was boring and something we could have gotten anywhere. The meal was somewhat redeemed by a delicious dessert of flourless chocolate/Sicilian orange torte, which had fresh whipped cream and candied orange peel on top. And the most recent time, I tried a few bites of the beet salad (good), the duck with red wine cherry sauce (SO GOOD), and the farfalle with cream sauce, prosciutto and asparagus (not great). The farfalle was pretty bland and since ZaZa's food is not salty and there is no salt on the table, I was disappointed. Split a chocolate mousse for dessert that had Kahlua in it and espresso beans and whipped cream on top which was lovely. Overall, this restaurant has more outstanding entrees than most. I've been disappointed only with a couple entrees (and the bread is sometimes boring, since I think it's frozen ciabatta rolls from Wegmans). The wine is consistently good and so are the desserts I've tried. Service is a mixed bag. The hosts are almost TOO professional and helpful, and so are the servers...until after your food comes, and then it's almost impossible to get the check, get your leftovers wrapped up, etc.
I took my parents out last night to Zaza's on a whim and was blown away by the whole meal! The food was amazing, from the appetizer special of endives stuffed with lobster, crab, red peppers etc. to the out of this world delicious chocolate hazelnut cake. The service we received made everything that much better. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable- she recommended the perfect wine for my tenderloin. The atmosphere is quiet and relaxing, they even had the fire going. I would really recommend this to anyone!
Despite being 3000 miles away from the some of the most luxurious and upscale Italian restaurants back home in SoCal, my foray into the wonders and flavorful nuances of Italian cuisine has led me to ZaZa's Cucina in Ithaca, NY. Prompted by our epicurean curiosity and herculean appetite for fine dining and decent, Italian food, a bunch of my friends and I made reservations to ZaZa's. To be honest, we've heard mixed reviews about the place from an Italian friend but were eager to try it out anyway. Fortunately we went with our culinary instincts and were blown away by the restaurants decor and quality of food. As mentioned in earlier reviews about ZaZa's, its menu is quite extensive and an epic testament to Italian traditions. We started off with a pumpkin-squash combination ravioli that was drizzled with truffle oil. The truffle oil gave it a nice, sharp taste and an interesting bite to it. Along side with the ravioli appetizer, we also ordered an anchovy salad with a balsamic vinaigrette. Refreshing, zesty, and a bit nutty would be the best way to describe it. The appetizers only whetted our eagerness to feast on our main entrees; the latter did not disappoint. Our entrees all came around the same time, which was a very nice gesture, on the behalf of the restaurant staff, because it feels more comfortable to be eating at the same time with chatter kept at a minimum. My veal cutlet was just phenomenal--it was a generous cut of veal (oh gosh, I still feel guilty about it!) cooked to perfection under a coat of melted, sliced mozzarella cheese. I also had the opportunity to try some of the dishes, namely the lobster risotto, which my friends had ordered. They were all equally, if not more, delicious. The desserts get an honorable mention from me, but they certainly won't wow or surprise your taste buds. It's your typical Italian fare, as far as desserts are concerned. So why five stars? ZaZa's Cucina has wonderfully, authentic Italian food served in bountiful proportions to please the most picky and hungry diner out there. You probably won't find another place like it in Ithaca, where quality Italian restaurants are quite rare. I would also like to add that the service is subtle but efficient; they make you feel like family without being too overbearing!
Zaza's is an all time Ithaca favorite of mine dating back to year one of grad school. I usually fall back on the ahi which is always seared perfectly! Their homemade pastas are usually spot on as well. Was sad to see on my recent trip back that they no longer have the truffle infused mushroom polenta appetizer, it was divine but they still have a tone of other high quality options!
The food wasn't really that savory to me. Everything tasted okay, but could have had a lot more flavor.  This place is a lot more expensive than other restaurants with "$$".  I'd rather go to another Italian place right down the road. Only reason I'll go with 2, is because they had a nice menu and the service wasn't bad.
I absolutely love this place. I've been here twice and both times were very good experiences. The food is always great featuring clean, classic flavors. Presentation, ingredients and flavors are not too pretentious or adventurous, but still pleasing and well-executed. The last time I was here I had the seasonal pumpkin ravioli in a sage brown butter sauce and it was to die for! It was definitely one of those meals in which flavor impacts your senses so strongly that it  leaves a lasting impression in your mind. The cocktails that I've had here are also good. Service is great and they took our coats at the door which is always a nice touch. The atmosphere is also a plus, giving an almost grandiose, open air kind of feeling. It has a modern feel with classic inspiration. This place is great for dates. One of Ithaca's best restaurants. Definitely make a reservation if you're planning for a weekend night.
In Los Angeles I would have given this place two stars but considering that there is no other Italian place in Ithaca that makes most of their pasta, gnochi, and ravioli from scratch I am going to give it three stars. The first time I went I ordered a gnochi in a bolognese type sauce. It was pretty good. It had the proper amount of herbs and spices to make the sauce zesty, meaty, and tart. I would have preferred it a bit saltier but overall the flavor of the sauce was good. However, the texture of the sauce was a bit off, the meat was ground a bit too much, and tasted like it had been overworked, it was also a bit too greasy, and not in an extra virgin olive oil kind of way, but in a fatty meat kind of way. I would have preferred them to get a bit leaner cut of ground meat and use more olive oil. The gnocchi was slightly over cooked, but not too much to complain about. The second time I came, I ordered a fish picatta dish (some sort of white fish), which was not quite tart enough in my opinion. They did not use enough lemon in the sauce. However, the fish was cooked well. If the food were cheaper I might have given them four stars, but $20 for a plate of pasta slopped on the plate with very little attention to presentation is a bit much. On the other hand, the place is very nicely appointed and the service was spot on. I probably won't go back on my budget. When I am willing to spend 35$ on a meal there are much better places in that price range than here.
Good food, good selection, inexperienced staff.
I've been to Zaza's twice now in the past month, and will definitely be going back. On my most recent trip, my fiance and I brought a friend, and we split three appetizers and two entrees. We had to sit at the bar because we hadn't made reservations, and didn't take into account that it was move-in weekend for Cornell, so the restaurant was packed with families from out-of-town. The service here is informative and friendly, without being overbearing. The bartender placed linen napkins at our places to serve as impromptu tablecloths, and prepared us some delicious cocktails. The Venetian Summer was a refreshing blend of limoncello and prosecco with muddled mint. We sampled the warm artichokes, prosciutto and melon, and the diver scallop appetizers. The scallops were my favorite - they melted in your mouth under a crisp, light breading. They came drizzled with a bacon vinaigrette, which complemented the scallops without overwhelming their own delicate flavor. We ordered the gnocchi with Bolongese sauce and the mushroom risotto. We've had the risotto before, and it is not to be missed. Rich, creamy, mushroomy goodness. The gnocchi with Bolongese was good - not as good as some of the pasta at other local restaurants, but not bad, either. Zaza's remains a favorite for the food, the ambiance, the service, and last but not least, their inventive cocktails.
I'm allergic to wheat, and my sweetie is Italian.  Thank goodness Za Za's is here and serves the most amazing mushroom risotto!   They are the only Italian place in the area to serve risotto. I cheated once and had a small taste of to die for gnocchi.  My friends have raved about the pasta dishes as well. The atmosphere is a bit more swanky than many Ithaca restaurants, but its a nice place for a casual, quiet, special dinner with friends and a good bottle of wine.
I was taken out to Zaza's in the beginning of the month and boy did my date earn some brownie points! Firstly, we enjoyed two cocktails from the amazing specialty drink list. He had a Vespa Sidecar and I tried the Hibiscus Cocktail - both were beautifully presented, perfectly balanced and of high quality. We were a little bit intimidated by the huge beverage list (the wine menu is about the size of a King James Version) but our server gently guided us toward a suitable selection. We decided on a bottle of Gaja's Nebbiolo Blend (I can't remember what it was called, but it was delicious!). Our meal was heavenly; I started with a perfectly proportioned apple salad while my date had the pork belly salad, then we shared an order of the house-made lobster and prawn ravioli in a yummy cream-pesto sauce, and for our entrees I ordered the duck and my date ordered the tenderloin. Everything was specular; my only regret is that we didn't save room for a house made dessert. Great service, great atmosphere, will go again!
The best duck breast I have ever had in my life! Their red wine sauce for the duck breast tastes unique and exceptional! Their cooking time for the duck breast is so well controlled that the texture of the meat are the same every time I went there (I have been there at least 10 times and I ordered the duck breast 9 times^^). Their way of cooking keeps the duck breast very juicy retaining the meat flavor and also able to absorb the flavor of other ingredients. A Must-Try in life! Their lobster & shrimp risotto is also great! But it's difficult for me to finish it all by myself, because their sauce is very rich and greasy. However, sharing it with friends makes it perfect! I think their grilled 16 oz. certified "Premium Gold Angus" New York strip steak is really great too. I rarely eat beef, because my mom didn't want me to eat beef for some reasons. Being a human being for 30 years, I think I have only ate beef for five to six times. In general, I don't like the taste of "ordinary" beef, because I may be trained to dislike it. I am fine with Japanese premium beef like Kobe beef though. However, during one of my visits to zaza, my friends told me that the steak tasted so good that I should really try, so I tried for a bite. And it tasted sooooo good that I can never forget that experience of eating beef. I even told my mom that I might start eating beef after that time. :-)
We were in Ithaca for Cornell's parent's weekend and we were looking for some special restaurants- especially for one night that was my other daughter's birthday. After doing my research I decided on ZaZs's and we weren't disappointed. The interior is really cool looking. The service was very friendly. And the food was great. My dad ordered the duck and thought it was outstanding. All the appetizers and other entrees were also very good. Overall, it was a wonderful experience.
Service: Fine dining service experience! Food: Really good. I got the mushroom ravioli with the walnut sauce and it was sooo GOOD! It was out of this world.  I think my entire family really liked my dish too. They loved their food as well and said it was delicious. My sister got this steak my dad got cioppino, my mom got this vegetable soup and my brother got a fettuccine.   Price: Worth it for the food! Go here for a special occasion! we went for my sister's birthday Atmosphere: They treat you like you are at a five star restaurant in an five star hotel. So nice and polite. The restaurant decor was really thought out and beautiful. The ceiling especially! Would go again! Enjoy!
I always enjoyed this spot. I've been to some solid Italian Restaurants and Zaza's is right up there with'm.
The latest incarnation of the bricks at 622 Cascadilla Street is ZaZa's, an Italian restaurant to make Virgil Sollozzo proud ("try the veal - it's the best in the city").  Before ZaZa's the space held the original VideoIthaca but the makeover is so good the only movie you'll think of is The Godfather.  The menu is time-honored Italian, sliced into four sections: antipasti, primi, secondi and dolci.  Do not, however, feel obligated to order a dish from each.  I advise a soup or a salad (antipasti), and either pasta (primi), or a meat or a fish (secondi).  As for dessert (dolci), one is enough for two. At ZaZa's don't let ambivalence scare you - just close your eyes and point, it's all good.  Make sure you try the soup.  Other favorites include the salad of buffalo mozzarella and tomatoes and basil, spaghetti puttanesca, and pumpkin ravioli.  And of course the veal (try the cutlets).  A single caveat:  if you order polenta be ready for deconstruction. The servers are friendly and efficient and the ceiling mimics a white duvet, inspiring - along with the food - thoughts of heaven.
What a surprise!  Didn't this place used to be a video store? Feels like a special occasion.  Loved the gnocci in blue cheese cream sauce.
I was so surprised by the level of detail at this place. I didn't feel like I was in Ithaca!! Anyway, to get to the point it's a excellent Italian experience - I believe it's among the best if not the best north of Westchester County! Whether you're local or visiting it's a must do.
appetizers, pastas, and main dishes = decent to very good, but not excellent.   You're getting standard dishes, and they're nicely done, but nothing sets ZaZa's appart from what I think of as neighborhood Italian places (the kind with paper placemats) except the higher end decor and touches like "nice restaurant"-level waitstaff. Basically, if there were more competition for this type of food in Ithaca, ZaZa's couldn't pass off the food it serves as "fancy."   The desserts are very good.  I think in general I'll reserve ZaZa's as a wine and dessert destination more than anything.
Really great food, interesting unique cocktails and a great atmosphere. My boyfriend and I come here on special occasions because it's a tad on the pricey side, but it's worth it! Their lasagna is easily the best dish on their menu.
My wife and I were in Ithaca for a short weekend visit to the Finger Lakes.   Za Za was a spur-of-the-moment selection, but turned out to be a real find.  THe food was great, the service was prompt and professional, and the environment was energetic.   We would definitely return.
I  thoroughly enjoyed my experience at  Za Za's Cucina, I thought the pasta to be authentic, fresh and expertly prepared. Although  Za Za's Cucina could be considered pricey by some I believe it's well worth the price. The atmosphere is refreshing and some of the pasta dishes seemed very creative and original. Za Za's Cucina is an excellent addition to the Ithaca food scene and I highly recommend a visit.
good, a bit pricey, not great - nice atmosphere
Context: I came here for a friend's birthday dinner on a Saturday night. It wasn't too crowded. Pros: Nice decor/ambience. Friendly service. The pesto/olive oil dish that came with the bread was addicting. Salmon entree actually tasted fresh, as did scallops dish. Normally, I stay away from seafood in Ithaca, but this was surprisingly good. Espresso milkshake dessert was also tasty, with gelato instead of ice cream. Berry crumble also came with a scoop of vanilla gelato. Cons: The bread was probably from a supermarket. Mushroom ravioli was too salty, the beets in the beet salad tasted like they were from a can, and the berry crumble was pure sugar. Prices were high. Overall: It's OK to come here. It's just not a preferred option.
Based on the reviews I thought I'd get at least a slightly above average meal. But I was not impressed. They had a broccoli /parmesian soup although it was more like pureed broccoli and luke warm. Next I had the spinach /riccotta ravioli in bolognese sauce. Now I am not a huge fan of meat sauce but this was pretty mediocre. More like tomato sauce flavored ground beef instead of tomato sauce with bits of meat. And the homemade raviolis were hard at the edges and a little tough. I am not advocating Olive Garden but I think you could have had a slightly better meal.
My fiance, and I had dinner here Sunday night.  Our waitress was excellent.  She recommended 2 great wines for us, and was very knowledgeable about the menu.  The atmosphere inside was also very good.  My 1st issue was that they did not serve Italian bread.  How do you not serve Italian bread in an Italian restaurant?  We had to ask for it, and it was 2 dinner rolls served with olive oil & herbs.  It tasted good, but I was not expecting to be dipping a dinner roll in olive oil at an Italian restaurant.  We ordered the rack of lamb, and smoked mozzarella with asparagus ravioli.  Both dishes tasted great - the lamb was cooked perfectly, but the serving sizes were very skimpy.  I am not a fan of ginormous portions, but the serving size on these 2 dishes was lacking.  The serving of mashed potatoes & vegetables served with the rack of lamb was tiny.  I think there were maybe 8 green beans on the plate.  There were also only 6 ravioli in the dish.  For $16 I am expect more.  Again, the food tasted great but I think this restaurant needs to be more generous with their portions.  For dessert we had the chocolate hazelnut torte which was delicious, and the serving size on the dessert was perfect!  Dinner portions needs work.
The test for Authentic Italian to me is a Lasagne Bolognese. Real Bolognese, with liver & besciamella. They do it right! Minus one star for the totally unnecessary glopping of marinara on top. Really? WHAT is that doing there? The last time I was there (Thanksgiving 2009) the waiter was rather useless, but the guy was very happy and that made up for his uselessness. I come back every time I'm "home"! Every dish is lovely and the wine list is quite good. They DO need a simple cheese plate for dessert though, or a macedonia di frutta. The pastries/sweets are too much. They also stop serving early, or maybe that's just my Boston-ness.
It's a very nice room and one of the few Ithaca options for Italian food.   The price-level is pretty good for the types of food and the food itself is quite good but I wouldn't call it great.  The sauce-based dishes are fine but the sauces themselves are nothing that particularly stands out or is distinct from something one could prepare at home.  Overall, Za Za's is a good option because of the variety of the options available if you're in a group.  The 3-4 meals I've had there have never stood out as anything special.
Nice atmosphere. Ithaca really needs better restaurants as this is supposed to be one of the better Italian restaurants. The food was good, ambience and service are excellent.
I chose ZaZa's Cucina as the venue for a birthday party based on other Yelp! reviews.  I wanted something that was a little more upscale than what you would typically find in Ithaca, and ZaZa's seemed to fit the bill.   The management was extremely helpful in planning out the night, including the flow of events, the menu, and the drink options.  My only complaint is their inflexibility in terms of timing.  We were only a group of about 12 people, but they wanted to get us seated for dinner at 6:30pm instead of 7 or 8pm because that was their busiest time.   In terms of the dinner itself, we got a prix-fixe family style menu - the appetizers were good.  We got the caprese salad, calamari, and caesar salad.  I would skip the caesar salad next time, but the caprese was fresh and the calamari was decent. For our main course, we had rigatoni with smoked mozzarella and a farfalle with pancetta.  We also got salmon and chicken parm.  For sides, we had green beans, polenta, and mashed potatoes.  The salmon and chicken parm were fantastic.  I wasn't a huge fan of either pasta dish, but I'm not sure that the prix-fixe option is a true representation of their abilities. The service was top-notch throughout the night and the cocktails were great as well.  The decor at the restaurant is a little bizarre - there are lots of naked people and roosters everywhere, but besides that, I would definitely recommend ZaZa's for an Italian night out in Ithaca!
Delicious food, every single time. This place is classy.  The servers are professional, the food is delicious, the atmosphere is romantic.  I've loved every meal.  The raviolis are fresh, and the gnocchi is the best I've ever tasted.
The outside of this restaurant is totally misleading - it looks like it might be an old warehouse or a run-down single-story office building.  But inside it's cozy and nicely decorated and very comfortable. I had a really fantastic experience here - sat at the bar with a friend and was served by a very sweet and personable bartender.  She recommended the gnocchi and house-made pasta (both were excellent) and the vanilla bean creme brulee.  I'm a sucker for home made pasta and it definitely lived up to its reputation here, but the real star of the night was the creme brulee.  I mean, I've had my share of exceptional creme brulee and custard in the past but....I might have to say that I can't remember a better one than this.  Creamy, sweet (without being sacharrine), full of rich specks of vanilla bean and perfectly caramelized on top.  Really, really wonderful.   And best of all, prices were pretty reasonable - good value for the money.  If I get to Ithaca again, I'll definitely make another stop here.
As close as you will get to fine dining in Ithaca, and you don't have to break the bank to get it. Been there 3 or 4 times in the past year.  Food is always excellent, service isn't always the best, but its always acceptable. The hostess is kind of mean looking, and never smiles at anyone, but has been very accommodating to find a table on short notice. Can get kind of busy, so wouldnt hurt to call ahead for a table, so you dont look like a fool while waiting a while.  Please dont wear jeans a tee shirt, you will look a lot more than out-of-place.
An excellent restaurant - very good food, unusual atmosphere that offers something a bit quieter than many, good service. Good choice for a special night out on this town.
Part of the problem with eating out as much as I do is that nearly every restaurant eventually falls into the "hit or miss" category.  Zaza's in no exception - at times the food has been dull and the service aloof.  Other times my meals have been delicious and memorable. My four stars judge my past two visits.  The first of which, we arrived quite early for a dinner with my in-laws and their children.  Bringing the children along was not exactly in the plan, so I cringed as I made the reservation and admitted that we would be bringing two kids.  I found it to be a nice gesture that upon our arrival, although the kids were not yet there, our host asked right away if booster seats would be required.  We knew would be waiting for a while for the rest of our party and we ordered a nice bottle of wine and some appetizers.  From past experience here, I knew that I really loved their appetizers even if I did not always love their entrees.  I ordered a few cured meat options and my husband had a carrot soup and all was delicious.  When everyone else arrived, our server was very kind towards the kids and let my sister in law sheepishly order from the children's menu herself.  Once again I ended up ordering an entree that just didn't thrill me (some kind of seafood stew), but our desserts were wonderful (strawberry panna cotta and chocolate mouse) and we left the evening feeling satisfied.   The last time I was there we decided to eat at the bar and just do highlights - drinks, apps, desserts.  This was by far the best meal that I have had at Zaza's.  It was a snowy evening and I had some girly drink that I think was called an Abominble Snowman and then a glass of merlot.  I ate a shrimp appetizer as well as a bruschetta tasting, both of which were very nice.  Dessert was raspberry panna cotta this time, and a chocolate bread pudding (yummy, though it does not beat Fine Line Bistro's).  What actually made this my best meal here was the service.  I have low expectations for service in Ithaca so when I get a perfectly attentive and professional server it blows me away.  The woman at the bar was efficient, unobtrusive, pleasant and knowledgable.  I just really appreciated her perfect timing and her professional manner - it made the meal for us.  After this meal I have decided never to order another entree at Zaza's again (I have been eating here for years and too often they are dissappointing), because a few appetizers instead is definitely the way to go. The atmosphere here is great - I've been for several special occassions and they keep up well for the crazy holidays (I've been here for a few Valentine's Days and for New Years Eve once or twice).  Even when the entrees aren't that great, the space and decor still make you feel like it's a special evening out.
Hidden gem!  Doesn't look like much from the outside, but once you get inside you'll be truly impressed.  We had the rack of lamb which was excellent, and the waiter recommended the chicken parm.  Food was great.  My new favorite place in town.  Take out the tailored suit, and give it a try!
It kind of speaks to Ithaca's isolation that Zaza's is one of the best restaurants in town. Zaza's specializes in very basic Italian cuisine.  The food is not bad, but it is not great either.  The decor on the inside is just bizarre.  It's like the ceiling is a bed.  Incredibly strange. The salad was good and the calamari that we ordered was average.  It was a little chewy and very greasy.  What killed it for us was that there was a giant curly black hair in the squid that I found after chewing for a little bit.  What was even more disgusting is that we could see into the kitchen and no one had dark hair.  DISGUSTING. It was kind of hard to enjoy our main course after that.  But we both left with the impression that the food is just mediocre. The waiter was very understanding about this and was very nice about the whole situation.  With that being said, will we be going back?  Nope.
If you want a classy Italian restaurant in Ithaca for a dinner party or a date, ZaZa's is the place for you. I came here twice, first for a date and then for my graduation dinner (which was a prix-fixe). In terms of food quality, the pastas were decent, but the salmon was nothing special (at least for the time I got it). The desserts were good though! In general, I think ZaZa's is the place to impress a date and/or your parents whenever they come into town, but I've definitely had better Italian food outside of Ithaca.
Came here looking for great pizza but left after eating a fantastic Italian dinner topped off NY excellent service and reasonable prices.
Delic! Take the parents here  when they're in town :)
I went to Zaza's for a date and the service was excellent. The waiter was extremely attentive. My date got the spaghetti with clams and I got the lobster risotto. Both of the dishes were very generous and really good. You can really taste the seafood in both dishes. This is a great place to go for good Italian food. Didn't get to try any of the dessert though. If you're ever in Ithaca, definitely stop by.
Gorgeous food, professional staff- as good as it gets.
My first time at Zazas! Absolutely amazing!! Not only was the food amazing but our waiter (Kyle) was hands down the best service I have ever received! Kyle was very knowledgable, attentive, and made us feel very welcome! I will surely be back again soon!
Wonderful Italian restaurant. Exterior is not inviting but go inside. Nice decor, great service and good food. Wine list was good. We both had an enjoyable evening.
This has got to be the classiest restaurant in Ithaca.  Okay I admit my experience is limited but this place is well decorated and the service is that of a more upscale restaurant.  The food wasn't good, hence the stars, but the staff was friendly and very helpful with introducing the menu.  I had the shrimp and lobster risotto.  The shrimp and lobster were good and the risotto tasted undercooked.  Overall the dish was salty.  We had the mozarella cheese with tomatos and balsamic reduction.  This was delicious and I recommend it for an appetizer.  There are only three pieces of cheese though and four slices of tomato.  But the crust was very crispy and the cheese was melted.  My brother ordered the special of the night which was blue snapper.  Apparently this tastes just like regular snapper but is slightly larger.  This was flavored with lemon and herbs and the dish came with vegetables. The artichoke was delicious and the fish was very tender and not that fishy.  I would give this place 3.5 stars.   btw the parking lot is tiny! there were parking spaces but it's difficult to back up.  luckily we had a micro sized rental car. Sidenote, ZaZa's has gift certificates.
ZaZa's is a decent choice if you need to satisfy your craving for overpriced italian food.  The ambiance has a sort of "converted office building" feel that the animal print decor just can't hide.  Service is good here and it is one of the few options in town where you can seat large groups at a single table.  Overall, I think there are better options in town for a nice classy dinner, but it'll do if you're craving cucina italiana.
One of the best places in Ithaca!
Best date night spot in town.  The food is delicious, the ambiance is romantic, and the staff is very proffessional and courteous.  The menu is very extensive so it's hard to decide what to get since everything looks amazing so check out the menu before you go!  They have a full bar and an extensive drink menu.   My husband and I come here for birthdays, anniversary's and celebrations.  It's pricey but worth every penny.  We've been blown away by the homemade pasta, fresh marinara and all their seafood.  My favorite drink is the Dark and Stormy (with fresh ginger) - give it a try, the bartenders are magicians.
Very professional staff, very good pasta selections with lots of mushrooms and tartufi!!
the restaurant is much bigger than it feels from outside. the dome is interesting. food never disappoint me and they are big portion, leftover is good for a next day lunch. considering that, price is very reasonable.
Maybe I ate at the wrong place but this was NOT as good as some of these reviews made it sound. Portions were pretty small (that's fine for fine dining) but the food itself just wasn't that good. A caesar salad at and italian place should be A++ and it just tasted OK. I had the scallop appetizer and also tasted the fried mozzarella appetizer. Both had such a thick layer of breading it was like eating things from the frozen section. You can still have something be fried and keep it classy, it doesn't need to have a concrete wall of breading to taste good. I had the special which turned out to be a decent piece of sea bass smothered in cream (lemon aioli) and butter on top of some rice pilaf and 6 (yes 6) green beans. The plate looked like a snow storm. White plate, white rice, white fish, white sauce. It was so unappetizing and looked like Top Chef's worst nightmare. So heavy and bland. Jeez, mix it up a little bit with some color and flavor. What a waste. Want to know the best part, it cost me $25! Unless it's really desperate, I will not be back.
Absolutely love this place.  My fiance and I went there based on a recommendation from a friend so we were looking forward to trying out a date night place where we would feel a little bit more comfortable dressing up to go to.  The decor is warm and inviting but still refined.  We enjoyed it so much that we went back a second time a month later in a town full of restaurants! The first time we went, we tried the fried calamari and mussels in a broth sauce for apps.  The calamari pretty good but nothing compared to the mussels.  The calamari was pretty basic; you can get it at pretty much any good Italien restaurant.  They cook their mussels perfectly and the broth is heavenly.  I'm pretty sure that if it were allowed, my fiance would have taken the bowl of broth and and drank it!  Fortunately, he was able to restrain himself and use his spoon to finish all the broth.  After that we got the veal paillard and gnocchi bolognese.  Let's just put it this way, when we came back for a second time we got the same meals.  And while I've been known to repeat meals (at almost every restaurant we go to...) he has never done this with me and we've been together for five years!  We have yet to try dessert-we've been too full at the end of the meal!
Yum.  Definitely a favorite.  The lasagna is DIVINE.  Simply lovely texture with the bechamel, delicious meat, perfect sauce.  The mushroom risotto is absolutely delicious. Service is impeccable.  Each server is incredibly friendly, gracious, and seems happy to be there.  This really stands out and makes the whole experience that much more enjoyable.  The complimentary bread and oil/sundried tomatoes that is placed on each table is delicious, and the servers have even brought around seconds of it when I have dined with a group of friends here. Decor is lovely.  I think this used to be an old movie rental store?  Those days are in the past!  You'd never guess from the outside how romantic it is on the inside.  I have had such a great time with a group of friends here laughing and chatting, and have also been on amazing dates here. Five stars!  LOVE this place, would recommend it to anyone!  Can't wait to go back!
Best Italian place in town. The price is medium ranged, not so expensive considering the quality of the food and service you get. My favorite dishes are the lobster risotto and veal parmesan.
I took my parents out last night to Zaza's on a whim and was blown away by the whole meal! The food was amazing, from the appetizer special of endives stuffed with lobster, crab, red peppers etc. to the out of this world delicious chocolate hazelnut cake. The service we received made everything that much better. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable- she recommended the perfect wine for my tenderloin. The atmosphere is quiet and relaxing, they even had the fire going. I would really recommend this to anyone!
Zaza's is an all time Ithaca favorite of mine dating back to year one of grad school. I usually fall back on the ahi which is always seared perfectly! Their homemade pastas are usually spot on as well. Was sad to see on my recent trip back that they no longer have the truffle infused mushroom polenta appetizer, it was divine but they still have a tone of other high quality options!
I absolutely love this place. I've been here twice and both times were very good experiences. The food is always great featuring clean, classic flavors. Presentation, ingredients and flavors are not too pretentious or adventurous, but still pleasing and well-executed. The last time I was here I had the seasonal pumpkin ravioli in a sage brown butter sauce and it was to die for! It was definitely one of those meals in which flavor impacts your senses so strongly that it  leaves a lasting impression in your mind. The cocktails that I've had here are also good. Service is great and they took our coats at the door which is always a nice touch. The atmosphere is also a plus, giving an almost grandiose, open air kind of feeling. It has a modern feel with classic inspiration. This place is great for dates. One of Ithaca's best restaurants. Definitely make a reservation if you're planning for a weekend night.
Good food, good selection, inexperienced staff.
I was taken out to Zaza's in the beginning of the month and boy did my date earn some brownie points! Firstly, we enjoyed two cocktails from the amazing specialty drink list. He had a Vespa Sidecar and I tried the Hibiscus Cocktail - both were beautifully presented, perfectly balanced and of high quality. We were a little bit intimidated by the huge beverage list (the wine menu is about the size of a King James Version) but our server gently guided us toward a suitable selection. We decided on a bottle of Gaja's Nebbiolo Blend (I can't remember what it was called, but it was delicious!). Our meal was heavenly; I started with a perfectly proportioned apple salad while my date had the pork belly salad, then we shared an order of the house-made lobster and prawn ravioli in a yummy cream-pesto sauce, and for our entrees I ordered the duck and my date ordered the tenderloin. Everything was specular; my only regret is that we didn't save room for a house made dessert. Great service, great atmosphere, will go again!
We were in Ithaca for Cornell's parent's weekend and we were looking for some special restaurants- especially for one night that was my other daughter's birthday. After doing my research I decided on ZaZs's and we weren't disappointed. The interior is really cool looking. The service was very friendly. And the food was great. My dad ordered the duck and thought it was outstanding. All the appetizers and other entrees were also very good. Overall, it was a wonderful experience.
I always enjoyed this spot. I've been to some solid Italian Restaurants and Zaza's is right up there with'm.
What a surprise!  Didn't this place used to be a video store? Feels like a special occasion.  Loved the gnocci in blue cheese cream sauce.
appetizers, pastas, and main dishes = decent to very good, but not excellent.   You're getting standard dishes, and they're nicely done, but nothing sets ZaZa's appart from what I think of as neighborhood Italian places (the kind with paper placemats) except the higher end decor and touches like "nice restaurant"-level waitstaff. Basically, if there were more competition for this type of food in Ithaca, ZaZa's couldn't pass off the food it serves as "fancy."   The desserts are very good.  I think in general I'll reserve ZaZa's as a wine and dessert destination more than anything.
My wife and I were in Ithaca for a short weekend visit to the Finger Lakes.   Za Za was a spur-of-the-moment selection, but turned out to be a real find.  THe food was great, the service was prompt and professional, and the environment was energetic.   We would definitely return.
good, a bit pricey, not great - nice atmosphere

My wife and I ate at Zaza's last night after a day of wine tastings along Cayuga Lake.  What better way to cap a Saturday night than a delicious Italian meal? The ambience was fantastic - very classy. No loud, obnoxious music. (Thank God!) The crowd seemed to be an interesting blend of either upper-middle-class people or Cornell students. Our appetizers (Caesar salad and the fried mozzarella) were awesome. My wife wasn't happy with the sauce on the lobster ravioli (read the description carefully!) because it was a pesto type sauce, not your typical marinara sauce. I ordered the red seafood spaghetti, which was great. To make my wife happy, we switched dishes. I liked the lobster ravioli too. The waiter was very professional and on top of everything despite being incredibly busy. I would eat here again!
Came here looking for great pizza but left after eating a fantastic Italian dinner topped off NY excellent service and reasonable prices.
Zaza's is one of our "go to" places for a special night out. I've been to the restaurant on many occasions, and it is generally very consistent in quality and service. I appreciate that the service staff is very well-informed about the food and the wine, and though I would prefer servers memorize the specials, it is better to have them read to me than for the server to not be informed about ingredients and preparation. I also appreciate that the service staff is trained to try to accommodate patrons however necessary. The entire staff is gracious, helpful and hard-working. Clearly, the owner does not tolerate slackers. I appreciate that the food is always very carefully prepared, and that the hot food is always at the right temperature (by that I mean piping hot, when it should be).   The particular appetizer we shared was interesting. It was a beautifully presented, stacked creation.  On the bottom was a molded disc of red quinoa, perfectly cooked. On top of that was a pleasantly piquant layer of finely cut and pickled shallots, celery, carrot, and red sweet pepper. Atop the whole pile was a scoop of shrimp and crab salad. And there were micro-greens in there somewhere , too. The star of this dish was definitely the pickled vegetables, and I could have eaten a whole plate of them.   For an entree, I had the "red seafood spaghetti," which was excellent. The house-made egg-spaghetti was not overcooked, as is often the case with fresh pasta in other restaurants, the arrabbiata sauce was exquisite, and the dish was loaded with cockles, baby mussels, squid, shrimp, and two diver scallops that were perfectly tender and juicy. I'm a big eater, and I was stuffed after sharing the appetizer and eating the pasta. Most recently I went there with my husband on our anniversary. I am a long-time restaurant professional, and as is always true in a restaurant, there are some little things that I would do differently. But there's an overriding atmosphere of professionalism at Zaza's that you don't find at many restaurants today. Some of the comments in other reviews here of Zaza's are odd, to say the least. "Ithaca sympathy points?" What on earth does that mean, and could the reviewer be any more embarrassingly condescending?  "The rolls are dinner rolls? " No, they're not.  They're small ciabatta, which is a recipe straight from Italy. "Small portions?" Absolutely untrue.  Not huge portions, perhaps, but perfectly adequate and appropriate. "High  prices?" I'm not sure where that reviewer goes to eat, but the highest-priced entree is the rack of lamb, at $26.00, which is low to average.  This cut of lamb is incredibly expensive, even for the restaurateur. (Generally speaking, expect to pay $50-60 per person, before gratuity, for two cocktails or glasses of wine, a shared appetizer, two entrees, and two desserts.) It's a restaurant. It's run by people. People are fallible, and sometimes not everything will be perfect. Clearly, the owner and chefs at Zaza's are trying to make a menu that appeals to the most people, because that's what restaurateurs do. And food is a matter of taste. In Italian cooking there are often variations between families and regions and styles. I once heard a chef say "There are as many different recipes for tira misu as there are families in Tuscany." There are so many different kinds of Italian restaurant that I find it bizarre to hear this compared categorically to other Italian restaurants in a statement such as "there are better Italian restaurants." Huh? Overall, it's a very good choice for a special night out, and the staff members will try to make your visit as enjoyable as they can.
Delic! Take the parents here  when they're in town :)
This is probably one of the best Italian restaurants in Ithaca. Though not as good as the really fancy places in NYC I have to say that this place rather nice. The decor is pretty fancy dimly lit with table cloths. There is a certain formal atmosphere to it. Attire is formal but because of the number of college students in the area that come it takes away from the formalness and you can get away wearing jeans and a casual shirt. The hostess is friendly and greets you at the door and escorts you to your table. The bread comes out warm and amazing and comes with a pesto and olive dip which is really nice which is something I really like about this place. The fried mozzarella and calamari are all really good appetizers. I've been here a couple times and each time the service has been friendly and helpful. For the main entrees I've tried the Lobster Ravioli with pesto sauce which is really delicious. I've also tried the pasta with sausages and red sauce, the chicken and  veal parmesan. All were really delicious. My top two would be the lobster ravioli and the veal parmesan. They are both flavorful and the veal is really juicy. The desserts here are also great as well. I say they'd even contest those of Madelines which is pretty well known for desserts in Ithaca. I've had the Tiramisu and the chocolate flourless torte before and both are really delicious. The flourless torte is really rich! If you really really are a chocoholic you should get this if not I suggest trying a lighter dessert. A few things to be careful of though. If you are planning on ordering wine definitely check the label because sometimes they don't serve you the same vintage that is on the menu. (This means there might be a price alteration if the vintage on the menu is known to be a particularly good vintage). Another thing to be careful of. A gratuity of 18% will already be charged for a large group. Make sure when you see this on your check. My friend paid for the checks of a group of 10 and paid tip on top of it by accident. They were nice about it though and issued him a gift card when he called back explaining the mistake. I also had graduation dinner with my family when I was here. Beware you have to make reservations around january during the year of your graduation to get a good time or even a spot. The graduation dinner is a set meal of appetizer, entree , and dessert per person which costs $60 per seat and is a little pricey. They actually don't cut down the normal  appetizer size for each person in this set so it actually ends up being a lot of food. Overall I've had a good experience here (enough to choose to have one of my last meals in Ithaca for a long time during graduation). If I come back to Ithaca anytime soon I will definitely hit this place up.
I went to Zaza's for a date and the service was excellent. The waiter was extremely attentive. My date got the spaghetti with clams and I got the lobster risotto. Both of the dishes were very generous and really good. You can really taste the seafood in both dishes. This is a great place to go for good Italian food. Didn't get to try any of the dessert though. If you're ever in Ithaca, definitely stop by.
My boyfriend and I went to ZaZa's while in Ithaca for a few days. We found it through these great reviews on Yelp and figured it's hard to mess up Italian too much. The restaurant is unimpressive from the outside but very beautiful inside, definitely a great ambiance for a dinner date or business dinner. The service was good, attentive but not overbearing and flexible on table preferences. What knocked this rating down was the food quality. I had the apple salad for an appetizer which was a generous size but wasn't anything unique. For the main course I had the lobster risotto per all the Yelp reviews raving about it. Maybe my expectations were too high as a result, but the flavor was very one-dimensional and very salty. Server also forgot to charge our card the first time around (brought the card and receipt back untouched) which kept us waiting for a while and gave my boyfriend a pen that dripped blue ink all over his hand. Four stars for ambiance but three stars for food and service.
Gorgeous food, professional staff- as good as it gets.
