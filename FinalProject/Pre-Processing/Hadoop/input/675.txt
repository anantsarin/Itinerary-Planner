I first came to Buffy for personal training after my son was born in 2003. She helped reintroduce me to my abdominal muscles. Since then I have seen her as a Feldenkrais practitioner for postural issues and injuries. I love to Crossfit and I was having sore knees. Buffy helped me so much and brought an awareness that I still carry with me into workouts. When my son was diagnosed with  developmental dyspraxia I knew Buffy could help him integrate his reflexes. Her rapport with my son was so sweet & he really looked forward to going. If you check her education you would be pleasantly surprised  that she's as smart as Spock! She's got a passion for the physical and emotional body. She can certainly help you with yours.
Buffy is highly educated and skilled as a hands on practitioner too boot. She works wonders whether it be leading a group class or individual sessions. Receiving work from her is a subtle but profound experience that brings about shifts in physical awareness that can translate to pain reduction as well as functional improvement. Highly recommended.
Although I've been in the health and wellness industry for 15 years and have helped many people with pain, there are occasions when my own old injuries flare up. As humbling as that can be, I feel safe and can trust Buffy to work on my body when it's hurting. She is an amazingly skilled practitioner and I give her the highest respect and recommendation.
Buffy is vivacious, focused, and devoted to helping her clients. She is a positive person who always maintains a can-do spirit. With each Feldenkrais lesson I have received from Buffy, I have benefited and improved my well-being.
