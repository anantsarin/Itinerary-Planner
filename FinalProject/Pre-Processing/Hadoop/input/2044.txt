I really enjoy this place.  When I think of the type of restaurant I want to go to decor wise, remington fits that to a t.  Parking is almost always a nightmare though and the menu leaves a little bit to be desired but overall I always have good service and great food.  Drinks are a little pricey...not horrible though.  I bought some shots for a friend's birthday and they were $8 each.  I paid more for three shots than they paid for the bottle...though I suppose this really isn't a "shot" place.  The steak sandwich is great.  Fries are really good and the dipping sauce they bring is incredible.  All raw items have always been good as well.
Delicious, great drinks, perfect atmosphere. I'd definitely come back. Especially in the summer.
Great food and service. Highly recommend this restaurant. We have been there at least 10 times and never had a bad meal or service.
Came here on a whim on a Sunday early evening around 5pm for dinner. We were starving so we decided to order appetizers.  We got the calamari and it was simply delicious - perfectly breaded and crispy, with a slightly spicy tangy dipping sauce. It is officially our favorite place for calamari, replacing Templeton Landing (they changed their recipe and it is now TERRIBLE so i'm glad we found a new place!) We also got some clams casino - not the best I've had, but pretty good. For our entrees I got the sesame crusted tuna and it was very tasty - the wasabi that came with it definitely had some kick to it which was great. My fiancé ordered the filet - it came with mashed potatoes and green beans. I had a piece and it was delicious. We both cleared our plates! We also ordered a side of fries with the malt vinegar flavored creamy mayo-like dipping sauce - amazing! I've always like the flavor of malt vinegar but not so much how soggy it makes the fries, so this was perfect!!! All in all, the service was efficient and courteous, and everything we ordered was excellent! Look forward to going back to try out some other dishes!
My girlfriend took me out for my birthday dinner last night based on a recommendation from some of my friends in the restaurant biz. I was actually very surprised - from the outside it looked far better than what I would expect in NT. Pretty decent location, and I like the brick as well as the open layout. They have a large, square open bar area where a lot of people sat to get drinks and menu items. Now, I have enough experience dining and reviewing to pretty much ignore what someone whose opinion I don't particularly respect tells me to do. This isn't a serious food column, and nobody here is Jonathan Gold. I went here one time and I left with a bad taste in my mouth (not from the food - more on that later). The biggest issue, really, dealt with the front of the house. We waited for over an hour....which they didn't warn us about. We wanted a patio table, they had a number of them open, but we waited and waited. Some older gentleman came in, slipped the hostess some cash, and walked right out to the patio table! They weren't even discreet about it! The hostess came by and offered some people behind us the option of being served right where they were. I was like "Enough", and went to the hostess and asked what the hell was going on. 30 seconds later we were seated....not on the patio, but whatever. At that point we were starving and just happy to get some food. Our server looked nervous - she knew the front of house screwed her over and gave her people who were already unhappy. The food was undeniably great. We started with two varieties of oysters and the house smoked salmon with pickled onions and horseradish cream. They give you a cocktail sauce with shaved horseradish for the oysters, which I thought was delicious. The oysters themselves were just fantastic. The smoked salmon was very similar to what they serve at Hutch's. For our entrees we ordered off of the specials menu. I had the soft shell crab special, and she got the wild salmon special. The salmon was crusted with coriander and mustard - something I hadn't tried before - but it worked very well. The fish itself was of the highest quality - a continuing theme in this place. They gave me two fried soft shell crabs, with green beans and potato and a super delicious sauce. I very much enjoyed it and polished it off.....no take away bag for this guy. Our server went out of her way to please us and knew the menu well. She was able to describe the differences between the types of oysters and elaborate on our questions concerning the other menu items. She was awesome.... and she saved my birthday dinner. So to her I sincerely say Thank You. To the ownership I would make two helpful suggestions to make this place better. The first is to replace that dog shit, shady front of house. Those people are far better placed in one of those chain joints at the Walden Galleria instead of a restaurant of this caliber. They have an attitude problem. They are harming your reputation. The second suggestion is to do what other busy places have done and take maybe half of your tables and make them available for reservations on weekends. It's busy enough where you probably won't take the haircut for the no-shows. So there you have it! Good food, good drinks, good service once you get a table, but admittedly staff professionalism is the one thing that will make me never want to be a repeat customer. I think if they improved on that a bit, this would be in my opinion one of the best spots around.
4th time at the Remington and I wasn't very satisfied with my food. My party had salmon, mahi mahi, and oysters. Nothing really popped out at me, in terms of flavor for the price I paid. It was decent. I've felt the same on my last three trips aswell. On a brighter note, the place is absolutely beautiful. Great vibe, great bar. Pretty good service too.  I will be back, I just am hoping for some better fare.
Stopped in on a busy Saturday night with a friend of mine.  We put our names on the waiting list to be seated and stopped by the bar to wait.  The bartender was extremely friendly and our drinks were promptly served.  We only waited 15 minutes before our table was ready. We ordered clams casino and the Diablo mussels for apps.  Totally delish!!  We both ordered the seared ahi tuna with green beans as our main entree.  I think orgasmic is the only way to explain this dining experience!  The tuna was unbelievable!  I was so sad when I finished it.  Normally I hate green beans- these were the exception to the rule!  There was not a crumb left!  Our waiter, Dave, was extremely attentive and his recommendations were right on the mark.
I do not even know where to begin with this review. I have to explain my 1 star with simply that, it was one of the worst experiences I have had with customer service in a restaurant.. maybe ever. To begin, I called to make reservations because it was for MY 25th birthday - table of 11 for 8pm. We arrived about 10 minutes early and expected to go to the bar and have a drink and wait for the table. 8:30 rolls around and two inquiries later, we were finally sat. Back room with another really loud table of umteen people. One server for these two big tables, bad idea. I got my first drink at 7:50 and I probably did not get another one until an hour later. Slow is an understatement. I could go on and on about what everyone ordered but I will keep it short and sweet. I ordered 3 apps, I wanted to try a few different things. I ordered the garlic parmesan oysters, almond shrimp and the banana peppers for my "entrée". The first two were amazing honestly, I wish I could say I was coming back to try them again. My entrée was the last to come out, maybe around 10:30pm. Yeah 10:30pm, about 20 mins after everyone elses. The server apologized and notified me that the kitchen gave me an extra pepper for my wait. Great thanks!  My boyfriend let them know it was my birthday and asked for a dessert to come out before we sat. Do you think it did?? Nope! Had to remind them as I was sitting next to him. Happy birthday to me. I won't continue much further, but the check was a F'IN DIBACLE. I won't be returning to this establishment ever again. Thank you Remington for a wonderful 25th birthday, I won't forget it!
I read the previous not so great reviews about this place, before heading here with my parents. My mom also gave me her verbal not so pleased opinion of the food here, but on the other hand my dad loves their oysters, so here we ended up. The venue itself is awesome. I love the space, the open patio, the lighting, and the location, right across from the canal. North Tonawanda needed something like this bad. Service was mehh, the server didn't know where the Oysters were from when my dad wanted to know their origin. She also forgot our drinks a few times, but made up for it by giving us bread to take home. Which leads me into their bread.... amazing. I would go back for bread and the location alone, it was so good. It was fluffy and flaky, topped with some herbs and heavenly. Just trust me, get some bread. Our server didn't bring it automatically, my mom knew enough to ask though. Food- Oysters were very good and tasty. On par for size and they were from Prince Edward Island and were the next best thing besides the bread. My mom and I spilt the stuffed banana peppers and the crab cakes. She loved the crab cakes and thought they were the best thing she has yet to order ( I also tried them , very good) and said she plans on sticking with them, since she has had some not so great entrees from there. Banana peppers were very cheesy, and hot in certain bites( seeds will get ya). Ambiance, bread and oysters are the best things going on here ladies and gents
For the area this restaurant is excellent. I have eaten at most of buffalo's premier restaurants and I strongly feel that the Remington ranks well. This restaurant offers a modern casual fine dining experience. There will be no classical violin playing and you might catch your husband watching sports center. But the cider brined pork chop is a masterpiece. Raw bar is very, very good (I love the mignonette). Stop ordering the salmon and wait for a sea bass special. Lastly this restaurant is in North Tonawanda not Manhattan so expect your server to be friendly and hard working, but not a sommelier. Go here 10 times and 5 will knock your socks off, 4 will be good, and you might get one off day.
The food is good and the place is nicely done -a large, open space with an upscale vibe.  It would be even better if someone in charge of music understood that old Rolling Stones, CSN&Y and old Led Zeppelin does not a thing for the atmosphere of a place quite different than Duff's or any other dirty beer joint in town. At these prices people with money to spend expect a great experience in total.  We don't have to overlook spotty service & bad music just to say we had oysters at the canal in NT.
I think the current Yelp rating of somewhere between 3 and 4 stars is pretty accurate. Generally, Remington is having an identity crisis. Are you upscale or casual? It's one of those places that hit some things right on the mark, and others fell a little flat. The good: The look and feel (or ambiance and decor, if you prefer) is great. It feels like a cool. slick, spacious, modern, not stuffy not weird kind of place. I was immediately impressed upon walking in. It was the highlight of our meal. That being said, the food should always be the highlight. The okay: The food was fine. I was expecting more impressive food for the price and based on the feel of the place. I think they would be better served doing a few things really well with more life to the flavors of the dishes than they do hosting such an extensive menu. The Wedge was okay - they were clearly trying to put some twist on the dressing by adding a horseradish/wasabi flavor to it, but it just ended up being too much sharpness with blue cheese and raw onions to boot. It wasn't balanced. My meal was a scallops dish with a squash risotto. The risotto was mild enough to not overpower the scallops, but the dish needed a little texture. Hubster had a steak, said it was fine ("nothing to write yelp about"). The service was equally "okay." As for the hostess, we were perturbed that on a not-so-busy evening, a couple was sat immediately next to us (when I say immediately, I mean it really felt like we were with them) despite 20 other open tables. We all felt awkward. The waitress was fine but missed a few "no onions" requests. Again, my expectations on the level of service were based on the scene set for us - so maybe at a different place, the service would have seemed better. The ugly: No reservations, and parking in nonexistent. You could take your chances and park around the block on some unmarked street, or choose valet - which charged up front (which was super weird and made tipping feel both more and less compulsory at the same time). The location of this restaurant does not warrant a valet service and it just raised your expectations of the meal you were going to have to a further unreasonable level. You can't have (essentially forced) valet and ALSO not take reservations. It's odd to have such a modern and cool interior with underwhelming (and therefore overpriced) food. Decide who you are, Remington, and commit!
Good restaurant. Oysters and clams are very fresh and quite good! Atmosphere is pretty cool. They don't have much of a menu. However, what they do have is quite good. I had the scallops and they were outstanding!! I would recommend the valet parking as there isn't a lot of parking. I would come back for the oysters!
I really want to give these guys 5 stars, but I feel like I need to go there one more time.  I had a wonderful experience with the food there, but there were just a few very small details keeping me from wanting to say that they could not get any better. (IE Lloyds) First let me tell you that for Seafood in or near Buffalo, this place should be the first one you consider.  The oysters made me think of Chesapeake Bay dining rather than Buffalo.. I don't know exactly what the staff does to ascertain such quality, but I feel that at the least, this aspect of my dinner was met and exceeded. Speaking of the staff.. I'll admit, I felt I'd shown up underdressed.. (A button down and jeans) but the hostess was more than kind and offered us a table without a reservation.. after a small wait at the bar, out table was ready.. (the bar was busy and it was difficult to get a drink, but I'd rather a busy place than an empty one).. we sat and had a very (almost too confident) waiter walk us through the menu, but I will give him credit for knowing his stuff.. it's always comforting to know your server has some knowledge of what goes into your dish. I actually broke from the seafood trend and tried the Cider brined pork.. (if I remember correctly) regardless.. it had an amazing sear and was served tastefully with just enough starch and veg to let me leave feeling satisfied but not over-stuffed... All in all the experience of eating, and sharing bites with my tablemates is what I remember most, and when I'm sharing food, it's a good thing. --- For those of you that claim that this place is gross and expensive.. simply take a look at the menu before you go, if you think the prices are too much, then don't go.. but please don't let price effect your review.. if that taste was off.. fine, if the service was bad.. fine, but if you had a great meal then simply enjoy that great meal.. after all.. that's the reason we went out to dinner in the first place isn't it??
Great wait staff. Had the diver scallops which was delicious. Wife had the strip steak... nothing fancy but cooked well. Also had oysters on the half shell very fresh. We would definitely go again.
Thank god the bathrooms are heated!  The rest of the place is a tad bit chilly... But it's a beautiful industrial urban decor - exposed red historic brick, standing fireplace, and pin lights.   Two dined in the party this evening. First we started out with a bowl of New England clam chowder which was more if a soup then a chowder. The clams were fresh but the soup on a whole was average. First entree was the steak and frites which was seasoned and cooked well but did not warrant a cost of $35. I have had better steaks locally for much less. The other entree was the chicken Milanese which the arugula  salad was a bit under dressed. The chicken cutlet lacked flavor, seasoning and a bit underwhelming. Maybe being a seafood exchange we should have chosen the seafood but with what they charge for meals and what I have read in  write ups about the restaurant I had higher expectations. Steak Frites
I really enjoy this place.  When I think of the type of restaurant I want to go to decor wise, remington fits that to a t.  Parking is almost always a nightmare though and the menu leaves a little bit to be desired but overall I always have good service and great food.  Drinks are a little pricey...not horrible though.  I bought some shots for a friend's birthday and they were $8 each.  I paid more for three shots than they paid for the bottle...though I suppose this really isn't a "shot" place.  The steak sandwich is great.  Fries are really good and the dipping sauce they bring is incredible.  All raw items have always been good as well.
Delicious, great drinks, perfect atmosphere. I'd definitely come back. Especially in the summer.
This was probably one of the best overall experiences I've had for a meal in Buffalo (and actually, even a few places in larger cities) for the price. I parked down the street a little and walked a block. The atmosphere was great - decor, the hostess, even the 80s music in the background. Our waiter actually sat us and was incredibly personable throughout the entire service. Drinks were expensive for cocktails but what I would expect from a place like this. They were delicious. The raw bar was great for the price considering they didn't skimp on the size of oysters or clams. My boyfriend ordered the fra diovalo (recommended by the waiter) and said it was the perfect spice -- the sauce was good enough to eat on its own. I had the rigatoni bolognese. Typically I dislike meat and red sauces but this dish was so flavorful. It wasn't overly saucy or meaty, but again, the sauce was good enough to eat on its own. Considering how great everything else was, we had vanilla bean cheesecake with carrot cake crust. Again, not disappointed. I will be returning and recommending it to anyone who enjoys seafood and a good time out. I spent the same amount at a restaurant in Chicago started by a celebrity chef and while that was good, I would pick Remington any day over the Chicago restaurant.
Great food and service. Highly recommend this restaurant. We have been there at least 10 times and never had a bad meal or service.
Service was great and the food was even better. Had the ribeye steak and it was done perfectly.

I had dinner here with a friend after hearing a lot of good things... our impression after dinner?  Can't believe a place like this exists in North Tonawanda! Remington Tavern is located in an old converted building and the feeling inside is very cozy and cool.  Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the menu which we very much appreciated when trying to decide what we wanted.  We split the calamari appetizer, which was light and crispy and dressed lightly in a spicy citrus sauce.  It was delicious!  Our waiter advised us that the salads were large, and if we wanted to split one, he would be happy to serve it on 2 separate plates.  Classy service.  So we tried the spinach salad special, which was very seasonal with walnuts, apples, and a warm bacon viniagrette.  My friend had the salmon which had a beautiful crust on it, she very much enjoyed it.  I tried the mahi mahi special, which was served with clams and a butternut squash and brussel sprout hash.  It was wonderful!   With 3 glasses of wine between the two of us, the bill came to $100 before tip, which is a little pricey, but honestly, the food and atmosphere was so good that I would not hesitate to come here again.  Its nice to

The name of this establishment is The Remington Tavern and Seafood exchange. They have a raw bar, but where is the seafood????????? Originally we were attempting to dine at Grapevine however they were too packed. My fiance was in the mood for seafood. In the Tonawanda/North Tonawanda area where is one to get seafood you ask? I then recalled a radio interview about remington tavern and seafood exchange on 103.3 the edge. Thinking that would be the perfect fit we elected to give it a try. First off parking was near impossible. I was later at ease when I found they had their own parking lot down the road approximately a 1/2 a block walk which was very nice. When we walked in we were greeted by a wonderful hostess who was cheerful and polite. She unfortunately had to tell us the wait would be about 15-20 minutes which was completely understandable as we arrived during the dinner rush. We went to the overcrowded bar for a drink. The bar staff was also a pleasure to deal with and quickly brought our drink order. After what seemed like forever we finally got our table. Someone from the wait staff quickly filled our water glasses and our server brought the "specials" menu. As we gazed over the menu expecting lobster tails, crab legs, shrimp and various other seafood we found nothing of a sorts. They have an extensive raw bar and you can order cooked mussels, clams and oysters but that is it. No lobster, no crab, no shrimp. I then saw for 8.00 I can get a cup of chicken, shrimp and andoille sausage gumpo, I thought GREAT!!!! When it arrived I found it bland, small for 8 dollars and didn't have a single piece of shrimp in it. Our main courses arrived I got a 14oz steak served over fresh cut french fries. She had a salmon dish. The steak was ordered Medium-Well I received it Medium-Rare to Medium at best. The server acknowledged the steak was well undercooked and offered to "heat it up" rather than making me a new one so I elected to keep the undercooked steak I had. Upon eating some of the steak I found it lacked flavor, something I could have cooked at home for less than the 34 dollars they charged. I do have to admit the french fries were wonderful. My fiance thought her salmon was good, but was missing something as well. When it was all said and done the bill was over 100 dollars which I wouldn't mind paying if the food was delicious. I think they should also expand the menu from a raw bar and a few different kinds of fish to include shrimp, lobster, and crab. Overall I found the atmosphere although loud, warm and inviting. I find this a great reuse building and commend the owners for taking the chance on part of North Tonawandas history.
I read the previous not so great reviews about this place, before heading here with my parents. My mom also gave me her verbal not so pleased opinion of the food here, but on the other hand my dad loves their oysters, so here we ended up. The venue itself is awesome.

On par for size and they were from Prince Edward Island and were the next best thing besides the bread. My mom and I spilt the stuffed banana peppers and the crab cakes.

Banana peppers were very cheesy, and hot in certain bites( seeds will get ya). Ambiance, bread and oysters are the best things going on here ladies and gents
Was told the wait would be 35 minutes on a Sunday night, even though I pointed out to the hostess there were 3 tables ready & available. I was told those were for people before me; well when I left the restaurant 2 hours later, those tables were still unoccupied, I would think since I asked to sit there the snippy hostess would seat us, but no luck . I did not know you had to ask for bread, most places just give it to you. Another place they skimped on was dessert. Payed $9 for strawberry shortcake which had only 5-6 slices of strawberries on it. At least the main course was good. Don't plan on going back though, prefer to dine at a place where I will be seated as soon as a table is available.
The food is good and the place is nicely done -a large, open space with an upscale vibe.  It would be even better if someone in charge of music understood that old Rolling Stones, CSN&Y and old Led Zeppelin does not a thing for the atmosphere of a place quite different than Duff's or any other dirty beer joint in town. At these prices people with money to spend expect a great experience in total.  We don't have to overlook spotty service & bad music just to say we had oysters at the canal in NT.
Pretty damn classy- nice set up.  EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE- talk about weeding out most restaurant goers, but I get it - it 's like a Chop House- honing in on a certain clientele.  We had a large party (of which we called 4 times for reservations and when we got there they knew nothing about it) which was accomodated in a back room.  Waitress was young and left alot to be desired.  She didn't get the whole "Ask if they need another drink" concept.  Parking is a bit of a nightmare- they need valets. Meals were fresh and tasty and memorable.  I didn't foot the bill so I walk away giving it a 4- 4 1/2.  If I had footed the bill, .................well I might have been a bit tougher on the review.
I really want to give these guys 5 stars, but I feel like I need to go there one more time.  I had a wonderful experience with the food there, but there were just a few very small details keeping me from wanting to say that they could not get any better.

Definitely steep on the prices, but this is the only place I've ever been that served Brussel sprouts that I not only tolerated, but loved. My steak was cooked to perfection. I won't go here often, as it's not in my budget, but I would definitely go again.
Thank god the bathrooms are heated!  The rest of the place is a tad bit chilly...

This place actually finally prompted me to sign up for a Yelp! account and post a review instead of just lurking.   I don't understand the complaints about the service-- I thought the staff was friendly enough-- we sat at the bar and ate, the bartender was attentive, and left us to our conversation.  What more can you ask for? The oysters were phenomenal, and we were very happy with our entrees (rib eye steak-- perfectly medium rare, thank you, and seafood stew).  The only complaint we had, only thing holding back that fifth star, was the stuffed jalapenos were really small and only three to an order-- I don't mind paying for something, but this app was pretty skimpy. Speaking of the prices-- again, not sure what people were expecting here-- we had a few drinks each, dozen oysters, app, two entrees-- $140 before tip.  Not someplace you're going to eat every week, but for a nice treat once in a while, I would in no way call that unreasonable.  Looking  forward to going back when it's warmer and sitting on the patio!
This was probably one of the best overall experiences I've had for a meal in Buffalo (and actually, even a few places in larger cities) for the price. I parked down the street a little and walked a block. The atmosphere was great - decor, the hostess, even the 80s music in the background. Our waiter actually sat us and was incredibly personable throughout the entire service. Drinks were expensive for cocktails but what I would expect from a place like this. They were delicious. The raw bar was great for the price considering they didn't skimp on the size of oysters or clams. My boyfriend ordered the fra diovalo (recommended by the waiter) and said it was the perfect spice -- the sauce was good enough to eat on its own. I had the rigatoni bolognese. Typically I dislike meat and red sauces but this dish was so flavorful. It wasn't overly saucy or meaty, but again, the sauce was good enough to eat on its own. Considering how great everything else was, we had vanilla bean cheesecake with carrot cake crust. Again, not disappointed. I will be returning and recommending it to anyone who enjoys seafood and a good time out. I spent the same amount at a restaurant in Chicago started by a celebrity chef and while that was good, I would pick Remington any day over the Chicago restaurant.
We REALLY wanted to like this place. Such a cool atmosphere and who doesn't love a raw bar? We got there on a Friday at around 6:00 with a party of five. We were told it would be an hour to an hour and fifteen minute wait (they don't take reservations), which isn't too terrible. Honestly, the food was great. The service, however, was actually so atrocious it made the entire experience absolutely terrible. So many issues it's almost painful. Here is a list of why everything was so awful: 1. The bartender was extremely rude. When we were getting close to finishing our drinks, (we had about a quarter left in our glasses) we asked for another round, and she proceeded to pour more into our glass to only slightly fill it up to where the level was when it was first served to us. I then watched her pour someone else's wine glass almost completely full, clearly he was a friend of hers because she seemed more interested in chatting with him than serving us. 2. After over an hour of waiting at the bar my mom went up to ask about how much longer it would be until our party would be seated. The hostesses informed her our name was never on the list but they'd add it on for us. Not sure how they managed to mess that one up but about a half hour later we finally sit down. 3. We are now pretty hungry, and when we finally receive bread we each eat a piece and ask for another basket, which takes 25 minutes to get to us. At this point we had not even ordered our dinners, as our server was missing for quite some time. When we do place our orders and wait about 45 more minutes for them to come out, everything is great. (My tuna was delicious, and so was the soft shell crab). 4. My mom was told that garlic sauce would come on her order, which it did not, so she asked the server for some on the side. By the time he brought some to her, we had all finished our meals except her. 5. My husband and uncle both ordered a fish stew, in which the server told us included swordfish, salmon, shrimp, and calamari. When they got their orders, there was no swordfish OR salmon in the stew. When we asked the server about it he had said that they had run out of the swordfish much earlier so they were putting in whatever fish they had back there. Umm k, but it probably would have been nice to tell us at some point? We've never experienced anything even remotely close to that poor of service. 6. After all the issues we were pretty over it. I went up with my aunt to ask to speak to a manager and let her know our concerns. When we politely told her about all of the issues, she responded "I'm sorry you had a bad experience, thanks so much for bringing this to our attention, that's how we improve!" We said no problem, and asked how long they've been open. She said about a year so they don't have everything figured out just yet. Really? That's all you can say? Everything was handled so poorly, it's actually a joke in our family now. It was hands down the worst service any of us had ever experienced. Such a shame. I feel bad for the owner, and more so the chef.
Service was great and the food was even better. Had the ribeye steak and it was done perfectly.
I am visiting from Seattle and took my family here for dinner tonight. Here are the good things; Well designed space, great atmosphere, very nice wait staff. Needs improvement: The food is VERY EXPENSIVE. I travel a lot and often eat in large metropolitan cities and I would say that this place rivaled the prices of NYC or Los Angeles. However, the food was not worth the high prices. My father and I had rigatoni with bolognese sauce. The pasta had a very weird texture (read cheap quality) although the sauce was delicious but $24. for rigatoni with ground beef and a little pancetta? Also, the portion was huge. It was really more suited for two people. But why do this? i would have rather paid less money and received a normal portion with better quality ingredients. Everyone else liked their dinners but also, nothing special to warrant the prices. The funniest thing was that before the meals, they brought out a tiny basket of bread for us (6 adults and two kids), it was VERY small, just a tiny taste each but my sister complained and they brought out more. The waitress, although nice, forgot several things that we requested and needed several reminders. Perhaps the seafood bar is well worth it but for a family dinner, I wouldnt recommend it.
I had dinner here with a friend after hearing a lot of good things... our impression after dinner?  Can't believe a place like this exists in North Tonawanda! Remington Tavern is located in an old converted building and the feeling inside is very cozy and cool.  Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the menu which we very much appreciated when trying to decide what we wanted.  We split the calamari appetizer, which was light and crispy and dressed lightly in a spicy citrus sauce.  It was delicious!  Our waiter advised us that the salads were large, and if we wanted to split one, he would be happy to serve it on 2 separate plates.  Classy service.  So we tried the spinach salad special, which was very seasonal with walnuts, apples, and a warm bacon viniagrette.  My friend had the salmon which had a beautiful crust on it, she very much enjoyed it.  I tried the mahi mahi special, which was served with clams and a butternut squash and brussel sprout hash.  It was wonderful!   With 3 glasses of wine between the two of us, the bill came to $100 before tip, which is a little pricey, but honestly, the food and atmosphere was so good that I would not hesitate to come here again.  Its nice to
After wanting to check out Remington Tavern for quite some time, I finally made it there over the 4th of July weekend.  My friend called to make reservations for a group of four for Sunday at 6pm.  Similar to other reviewers, she was told they do not take reservations, but to arrive at 5:45 for a 6:00 seating.  The other half of our group promptly arrived at 5:45 and was told a 15-30 minute wait.  By the time my significant other and I arrived fashionably late at 6pm (traffic), they were already seated at a table outside on the patio waiting for us!  The place was pretty busy (almost every table inside & outside was full) so I was surprised they were seated so rapidly. Four ice waters and a basket of 4 slices of bread were already on the table when we met them.  About five minutes after us seating and greeting our friends, the waitress came to take our drink order.  Three beers were ordered, a glass of wine for yours truly, and an order of the fried calamari for our appetizer.  It wasn't until 22 minutes later we saw any of the aforementioned.  Yes, 22 minutes for our drinks to arrive!!! This was followed up with calamari less than 60 seconds later.  Why did it take the same amount of time for our drinks to arrive as it did for our appetizer?! Well I can't answer that because we weren't offered any explanation.  And frankly by the time those arrived we were all too parched and famished to bother to ask.  The calamari was suitable.  It was barley enough for 4 people to share; definitely split amongst two to get a decent sized serving. I decided to order off of the Daily Specials Menu, and chose the Chicken, Shrimp, and andouille jambalaya in a Cajun cream sauce.  My other half ordered the same thing, because he didn't see anything else worth sharing and I knew he would end up eating all of mine anyways if we split two entrees.  We both agreed on the following:  The noodles (rigatoni) were overcooked, the sausage was burnt, shrimp was delicious, chicken ok, and the cream sauce was good, except I added crushed red pepper to mine because nothing can ever be spicy enough for me!  For $26, we were both a little let down.  I would have at least expected the rigatoni to be executed properly.  Instead it tasted like they made a large batch of pasta hours earlier, over cooked it, and then refrigerated and warmed up for us.  Our friends ordered the banana peppers which a got thumbs up, but was a little too oily and garlicky, and a salmon dish off the daily specials menu - really good (he said). This place is located in a prime area on the canal in North Tonawanda, right next to the newer Lofts (eeeek - don't read the reviews for those lofts, pretty scary!).  Inside is aesthetically pleasing to the eye.  It has a gorgeous large square bar in the center.  The outdoor patio is pretty large (compared to patios in the city).   I was really hoping to be pleased with my dining experience here.  At this point I can fairly give it an "A-ok", 3 star review.  However with the prices on the menu and the over all higher expectation I placed for this restaurant, nothing higher would accurately suffice.  In my book, a 22 minute wait for a beverage is completely unacceptable; I don't care how busy it is.  And an explanation is definitely due upon arrival.  Shall I return, and I am sure I will, I will update my review if necessary. PS - Parking - good luck! We had to park almost a mile away!!
The name of this establishment is The Remington Tavern and Seafood exchange. They have a raw bar, but where is the seafood????????? Originally we were attempting to dine at Grapevine however they were too packed. My fiance was in the mood for seafood. In the Tonawanda/North Tonawanda area where is one to get seafood you ask? I then recalled a radio interview about remington tavern and seafood exchange on 103.3 the edge. Thinking that would be the perfect fit we elected to give it a try. First off parking was near impossible. I was later at ease when I found they had their own parking lot down the road approximately a 1/2 a block walk which was very nice. When we walked in we were greeted by a wonderful hostess who was cheerful and polite. She unfortunately had to tell us the wait would be about 15-20 minutes which was completely understandable as we arrived during the dinner rush. We went to the overcrowded bar for a drink. The bar staff was also a pleasure to deal with and quickly brought our drink order. After what seemed like forever we finally got our table. Someone from the wait staff quickly filled our water glasses and our server brought the "specials" menu. As we gazed over the menu expecting lobster tails, crab legs, shrimp and various other seafood we found nothing of a sorts. They have an extensive raw bar and you can order cooked mussels, clams and oysters but that is it. No lobster, no crab, no shrimp. I then saw for 8.00 I can get a cup of chicken, shrimp and andoille sausage gumpo, I thought GREAT!!!! When it arrived I found it bland, small for 8 dollars and didn't have a single piece of shrimp in it. Our main courses arrived I got a 14oz steak served over fresh cut french fries. She had a salmon dish. The steak was ordered Medium-Well I received it Medium-Rare to Medium at best. The server acknowledged the steak was well undercooked and offered to "heat it up" rather than making me a new one so I elected to keep the undercooked steak I had. Upon eating some of the steak I found it lacked flavor, something I could have cooked at home for less than the 34 dollars they charged. I do have to admit the french fries were wonderful. My fiance thought her salmon was good, but was missing something as well. When it was all said and done the bill was over 100 dollars which I wouldn't mind paying if the food was delicious. I think they should also expand the menu from a raw bar and a few different kinds of fish to include shrimp, lobster, and crab. Overall I found the atmosphere although loud, warm and inviting. I find this a great reuse building and commend the owners for taking the chance on part of North Tonawandas history.
Went out to the Remington for dinner on a Sunday evening. We arrived promptly at 4pm when they opened for service. Parking was not an issue, but I can see how at peak times it would be. I've been in Buffalo for over six years now, though I am from Brooklyn originally. The person taking us out told us that this was an upscale place serving primarily steak and seafood. Upon entering, I noticed how pleasantly open the space was. The bar looked appealing, but not nearly as much as the two fireplaces. Lots of windows, though with the snow, there wasn't much to see. The waitress was nice and helpful. I split an order of the calamari with my fiancee. It was a large serving and was quite good. However, the chili sauce was lacking. I asked for a side of cocktail sauce to supplement. I had the seafood fra diavolo which was well done with mussels, shrimp, and squid. The sauce was very good - chunky, well seasoned, and not overly spicy (but, if it was up to me, the spicier, the better!). I had the almond biscotti gelato, which was also quite good. My fiancee had the blackened salmon, which she also enjoyed. Overall, the service, food, and ambiance were all good! Admittedly, the person who took us there was not as happy. He made some particular requests with his salad and salmon entree that were not quite up to par in his eyes. However, I didn't equate that into my rating. Wine and beer selections, as well as the raw bar were all a plus, though we did not drink or partake in the raw bar selection. Ultimately, the meals were reasonably priced for the ambiance and the quality of the food and service. Though, the menu was slim. We hoped for a larger selection. While there was a decent amount of seafood on the menu, a variety would have been better. One thing that was odd was the sides they offered with the seafood. With the salmon: Sweet and sour cabbage and roasted potatoes. Not what I would expect. Perhaps they went for something unique. While this is considered by some as "upscale," it felt like a typical restaurant to me. The restaurant itself had a quasi-bar restaurant feel, which detracts from its suggested upscale nature. There are two flat screens right over the bar, which is located in the middle of the restaurant. The building itself is unique, and the brick inside is attractive - but again, not an upscale feel. This was magnified by the rather loud music, which was turned down and changed as the night went on. Nonetheless, I would go back in the future.
Enjoyed a great evening at the Remington last night.  First off, my wife and I ate at the bar as the service from Dickie and Peter is always friendly and spot-on. Kath can't resist the fries with the malt vinegar aoli so she started with those and I had fresh oysters.  So good! Then cam the entree decision.  We were leaning towards the tuna, however, we were suggested to take a second look at the veal porterhouse.  When someone stakes their reputation on it, you go with it.  And delicious it was.  It was cooked just enough and served with a bourbon peppercorn sauce.  The sauce was slightly sweet but also a little spice from the peppercorn.  So glad we went with it. That and a good bottle of wine to share with my wife made for an enjoyable evening.  So glad Remington is in our backyard.
Was told the wait would be 35 minutes on a Sunday night, even though I pointed out to the hostess there were 3 tables ready & available. I was told those were for people before me; well when I left the restaurant 2 hours later, those tables were still unoccupied, I would think since I asked to sit there the snippy hostess would seat us, but no luck . I did not know you had to ask for bread, most places just give it to you. Another place they skimped on was dessert. Payed $9 for strawberry shortcake which had only 5-6 slices of strawberries on it. At least the main course was good. Don't plan on going back though, prefer to dine at a place where I will be seated as soon as a table is available.
We have been here twice. Both times have been outstanding. I am vegan and while there are ok vegan entrees or appetizers on the regular menu, chef Adam has accommodated us each time with an amazing entree and appetizer. The seafood menu is quite substantial as are the other non vegan options. The space is amazing and you will appreciate the adaptive reuse of the existing space. The bar and wine list is extensive. This is a wonderful addition to North Tonawanda's dining options.
Pretty damn classy- nice set up.  EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE- talk about weeding out most restaurant goers, but I get it - it 's like a Chop House- honing in on a certain clientele.  We had a large party (of which we called 4 times for reservations and when we got there they knew nothing about it) which was accomodated in a back room.  Waitress was young and left alot to be desired.  She didn't get the whole "Ask if they need another drink" concept.  Parking is a bit of a nightmare- they need valets. Meals were fresh and tasty and memorable.  I didn't foot the bill so I walk away giving it a 4- 4 1/2.  If I had footed the bill, .................well I might have been a bit tougher on the review.
Definitely steep on the prices, but this is the only place I've ever been that served Brussel sprouts that I not only tolerated, but loved. My steak was cooked to perfection. I won't go here often, as it's not in my budget, but I would definitely go again.
Great waiter, kinda disorganized staff, willynilly ancillary staff (busses, water person) but really good food.  Steaks perfectly done, yummy cheesy bread complimentary, really good stuffed banana peppers.  Seemed like half the staff were working hard, half the staff socializing, not sure that mgmt knows what is really going on.  People were waiting well over an hour for outside tables.  We ate inside and were seated right away.  Kinda loud but not awful.
This place actually finally prompted me to sign up for a Yelp! account and post a review instead of just lurking.   I don't understand the complaints about the service-- I thought the staff was friendly enough-- we sat at the bar and ate, the bartender was attentive, and left us to our conversation.  What more can you ask for? The oysters were phenomenal, and we were very happy with our entrees (rib eye steak-- perfectly medium rare, thank you, and seafood stew).  The only complaint we had, only thing holding back that fifth star, was the stuffed jalapenos were really small and only three to an order-- I don't mind paying for something, but this app was pretty skimpy. Speaking of the prices-- again, not sure what people were expecting here-- we had a few drinks each, dozen oysters, app, two entrees-- $140 before tip.  Not someplace you're going to eat every week, but for a nice treat once in a while, I would in no way call that unreasonable.  Looking  forward to going back when it's warmer and sitting on the patio!
i have ate at the Remington Tavern at least a couple dozen time and have never had a bad meal or poor service...truly a 5 star restaurant

We live in the Remington Lofts which we have found to be a huge disappointment and in that regard the Remington Tavern fits right in. I've dined there twice and been in a couple other times socially and I have consistently found the staff haughty and unpleasant. This review is of my second, and most likely last, experience at the Remington Tavern Wednesday, December 19th. Upon asking for a table, we were told 15 minutes. The hostess was not unpleasant but she didn't smile either.  I dined facing her and I didn't see her smile once all night. We went to the bar to get a drink before dinner, and despite having cash out and taking space at the bar that other patrons gracefully opened up for us, we were not able to get a drink from the bartender before dinner.  On my social visits to the tavern I've seen considerable favoritism between the bartenders and certain patrons and while that is to be expected, when you're serving ten dollars cocktails in North Tonawanda some service is to be expected.   So we are seated and the dinner is going fine. The waiter was not bad but very mediocre; again, no smiles, no charm, but serviceable. He answered questions but didnt ask any or try to make recommendations.  My date had soup and a bass special, I had a burger. Now of course my order isn't seafood or fine dining, but it's on the menu and what I wanted so its fair game for review. I will not hedge my bets: I hate this restaurant, the atmosphere, the concept, the execution. I feel it is a lot of flash with zero substance. But everything I have put my lips to, with one exception soon to be mentioned, has been pretty darn tasty. Tonight was the same: soup tasty (portion under-served, cup about 2/3rds full), burger looked awful but was cooked just right, juicy and delicious. My date's fish was tasty. What wasn't good?  A monkey dish of cold dog pooh served with my burger. Awful, cold, and the waiter couldn't say what it was but did admit everyone hated it. Yet it was the only offering with the $12 burger. Fries, side salad, chips all ala carte, all that comes with the $12 burger is a dish of cold crud. I did order a side of fries. Delicious. But they were $7 and we were served enough for 3-4 persons. I asked during the ordering stage about fries and was told I had to order them separately. My date asked again, because she recalled having a sandwich served with fries at an earlier time. Both times the waiter wouldn't budge and even though he admitted the side dish was lousy he offered no alternatives.  I think there should be an option between a dish of crap and a $7 bucket of fries for 3-4 people. A $3 side of fries, reasonable. A handful fries on a plate, because we're sorry we gave you a dish of cold crap our customers have universally disdained, even better. I understand upscale dining. But consider this: a $12 burger, a $7 side of fries, and a $2 soda (I think soda is more) totals $21. After tax that's at least $22.47, and with just a 15% tip you're at $25.84. For a standard sized burger, a lot of fries, and some soda. At that level of upscale dining I expect some ambiance, some unique quality, and a lot of charm and personality from the staff. None of those things are offered by the Remington Tavern.  Where I was seated, the busboy knocked the back of my chair at least half a dozen times.  The staff was attentived but never smiled and lacked genuine concern. To my right were five younger persons that weren't I'll behaved but were up and down to the bar throughout the meal more like a Quick-Draw pub than a decent restaurant. That's not the Tavern's fault but it is part of what they offer. The Remington Tavern has no soul or substance.  It's like a beautiful woman with dead eyes and no heart. Please, don't let these people fool you into thinking they are top shelf just because someone familiar with Hutch's is involved and it's in a remodeled warehouse that makes you think of Manhattan. You're in North Tonawanda, and in addition to some good cooking you have to be nice, show customer appreciation, and offer value. Added thought: we paid with cash, and we needed smaller bills for the tip. Our change should have been $7.36 but the waiter just brought $7 cash. I get it, change is a nuisance. But as a business owner, if you are going to take the stance that change is a nuisance, I feel you have to take the high road and short change yourself. Now I'm not going to let some punk waiter reduce me to the point I have to ask management for 36 cents and a reasonable chance at French fries. But the short changing convinced me what I suspect of the Remington: there are people of questionable character running the place and their malevolence permeates the entire staff.  I'll starve before I do business with these types.
I am visiting from Seattle and took my family here for dinner tonight. Here are the good things; Well designed space, great atmosphere, very nice wait staff. Needs improvement: The food is VERY EXPENSIVE. I travel a lot and often eat in large metropolitan cities and I would say that this place rivaled the prices of NYC or Los Angeles.

It's good food, but it's not great. You would think a place like this would take reservations on the weekend, but they don't. The wait once there wasn't terrible, but you are pretty much forced to stand at the crowded bar while your waiting. Once seated the waitress was very nice and the food was good. I kinda was expecting more but I would go back.
After wanting to check out Remington Tavern for quite some time, I finally made it there over the 4th of July weekend.  My friend called to make reservations for a group of four for Sunday at 6pm.  Similar to other reviewers, she was told they do not take reservations, but to arrive at 5:45 for a 6:00 seating.  The other half of our group promptly arrived at 5:45 and was told a 15-30 minute wait.  By the time my significant other and I arrived fashionably late at 6pm (traffic), they were already seated at a table outside on the patio waiting for us!  The place was pretty busy (almost every table inside & outside was full) so I was surprised they were seated so rapidly.

The atmosphere is excellent, the wine selection good and the beer selection is very good. Our server did everything possible to answer my array of questions about the seafood selections. The first course we ordered was the crispy calamari, this was one of the best fried calamari dishes I have had. The Thai sweet chili sauce was balanced nicely with fresh arugula and made the whole dish cohesive. Unfortunately that's where it ended. Our second course was the Grilled Oysters, while they were certainly fresh and tasty the oysters were simply passed over a wood fired grill to give some smokiness and were simply warm not actually cooked. The entrees continue the slide to average. My mother inlaw  had the steak sandwich, in itself was good but the kale salad it was served with was under flavored and lacked any acid to round it out(otherwise this would have been a complete dish). My wife and son split an order of the Bolognese which was over oily and greasy. My sister inlaw and I both had the striped bass which was very fresh and well cooked, the only problem with the dish was the grilled radicchio salad it was served with. This poor salad was so grilled it was charred and burnt making it more bitter than the raw radicchio itself, again a lack of any acid didn't help the salad either. All in all loved the atmosphere, the seafood was exceptionally fresh(especially for the area), the wine and beer lists get a thumbs up...but the food that has a great start really needs to be finished and more attention to detail needs to be addressed in order to make this a great dining experience.
Went out to the Remington for dinner on a Sunday evening. We arrived promptly at 4pm when they opened for service. Parking was not an issue, but I can see how at peak times it would be. I've been in Buffalo for over six years now, though I am from Brooklyn originally. The person taking us out told us that this was an upscale place serving primarily steak and seafood. Upon entering, I noticed how pleasantly open the space was. The bar looked appealing, but not nearly as much as the two fireplaces. Lots of windows, though with the snow, there wasn't much to see. The waitress was nice and helpful. I split an order of the calamari with my fiancee. It was a large serving and was quite good. However, the chili sauce was lacking. I asked for a side of cocktail sauce to supplement. I had the seafood fra diavolo which was well done with mussels, shrimp, and squid. The sauce was very good - chunky, well seasoned, and not overly spicy (but, if it was up to me, the spicier, the better!). I had the almond biscotti gelato, which was also quite good. My fiancee had the blackened salmon, which she also enjoyed. Overall, the service, food, and ambiance were all good! Admittedly, the person who took us there was not as happy. He made some particular requests with his salad and salmon entree that were not quite up to par in his eyes. However, I didn't equate that into my rating. Wine and beer selections, as well as the raw bar were all a plus, though we did not drink or partake in the raw bar selection. Ultimately, the meals were reasonably priced for the ambiance and the quality of the food and service. Though, the menu was slim. We hoped for a larger selection. While there was a decent amount of seafood on the menu, a variety would have been better. One thing that was odd was the sides they offered with the seafood. With the salmon: Sweet and sour cabbage and roasted potatoes. Not what I would expect. Perhaps they went for something unique. While this is considered by some as "upscale," it felt like a typical restaurant to me. The restaurant itself had a quasi-bar restaurant feel, which detracts from its suggested upscale nature. There are two flat screens right over the bar, which is located in the middle of the restaurant. The building itself is unique, and the brick inside is attractive - but again, not an upscale feel. This was magnified by the rather loud music, which was turned down and changed as the night went on. Nonetheless, I would go back in the future.
Great food but lack of reservations is a circus. We were told there would be a 2 and 1/2 hour wait then when our friends who showed up 10 minutes AFTER us were told a 45 minute wait. So we had drinks at the bar and the bartender gave us the change then tipped himself leaving us with a dollar on the bar...never had that happen before. Then the other bartender came around 10 minutes later and took that dollar. At that time we just started laughing. There are a lot of really great restaurants in buffalo (some owned by the same owners) I'll go there first until this place calms down and figures out whether its wants to be a "tavern" or an upscale restaurant.
Enjoyed a great evening at the Remington last night.  First off, my wife and I ate at the bar as the service from Dickie and Peter is always friendly and spot-on. Kath can't resist the fries with the malt vinegar aoli so she started with those and I had fresh oysters.  So good! Then cam the entree decision.  We were leaning towards the tuna, however, we were suggested to take a second look at the veal porterhouse.  When someone stakes their reputation on it, you go with it.  And delicious it was.  It was cooked just enough and served with a bourbon peppercorn sauce.  The sauce was slightly sweet but also a little spice from the peppercorn.  So glad we went with it. That and a good bottle of wine to share with my wife made for an enjoyable evening.  So glad Remington is in our backyard.
the space is great, the food is good but as another reviewer pointed out-this place is expensive.The amount of bread is tiny, but my main complaint was the astounding amount of salt-I ordered a steak and fries-I didn't taste the steak, I didn't taste potato-all I was able to taste was salt, salt, salt and more salt.The steak was doused, drenched,absolutely clobbered with so much salt and seasonings-my mouth was burning. The other odd thing was the excellent chowder.Usually,  to my way of thinking,chowder is a Friday,no meat option but theirs contained pork/bacon(more salt!)
We have been here twice. Both times have been outstanding. I am vegan and while there are ok vegan entrees or appetizers on the regular menu, chef Adam has accommodated us each time with an amazing entree and appetizer. The seafood menu is quite substantial as are the other non vegan options. The space is amazing and you will appreciate the adaptive reuse of the existing space. The bar and wine list is extensive. This is a wonderful addition to North Tonawanda's dining options.
We went to the Remington Tavern last night - me, my husband and my brother-in-law.  Excited for our first upscale dining experience in North Tonawanda, this place did not disappoint!  We found the annex parking lot at Sweeney and Main, and walked the quick block inside.  The ambiance was great inside - huge central bar, with beautiful high ceilings and the exposed brick from the old factory. We got the same 15 minute wait as many other reviewers did, and ours was just about that.  We had a nice table by the windows, which on a cold night were a touch drafty.  My brother-in-law ordered the sardines for an appetizer and said they were really good.  I had the house salad, which was a yummy blend of arugula and toasted pecans.  My husband had the Caesar salad, including anchovies (much to his delight!). My main course was fantastic - chicken Milanese, a lightly breaded and pan sautéed pounded chicken breast served with greens on top (would have been nice for the waitress to tell me it was the same as my house salad, but now I have lunch for today!).  My BIL had the grouper sandwich, described as OK, and my husband had the ribs, which were good.  Both of them made the same comment as other reviewers that the side offered was not good, and it would be good to have more side dish offerings. We skipped dessert because we were totally full and the selection was somewhat limited. Al in all, we had a great time and will definitely come back on our next trip to NT!
Great waiter, kinda disorganized staff, willynilly ancillary staff (busses, water person) but really good food.  Steaks perfectly done, yummy cheesy bread complimentary, really good stuffed banana peppers.  Seemed like half the staff were working hard, half the staff socializing, not sure that mgmt knows what is really going on.  People were waiting well over an hour for outside tables.  We ate inside and were seated right away.  Kinda loud but not awful.
Awesome food and awesome service.  The places looks great and has a great atmosphere.  The muscles and crab cakes were to die for!!
i have ate at the Remington Tavern at least a couple dozen time and have never had a bad meal or poor service...truly a 5 star restaurant
Went last night and loved it. Beautiful decor. Nice wine list. Service was very good; waitress was helpful, but unobtrusive. Entrees were delicious ( maybe a little pricey). It was our anniversary, and I think it is a perfect place for special occasions.
We live in the Remington Lofts which we have found to be a huge disappointment and in that regard the Remington Tavern fits right in. I've dined there twice and been in a couple other times socially and I have consistently found the staff haughty and unpleasant. This review is of my second, and most likely last, experience at the Remington Tavern Wednesday, December 19th. Upon asking for a table, we were told 15 minutes. The hostess was not unpleasant but she didn't smile either.  I dined facing her and I didn't see her smile once all night. We went to the bar to get a drink before dinner, and despite having cash out and taking space at the bar that other patrons gracefully opened up for us, we were not able to get a drink from the bartender before dinner.  On my social visits to the tavern I've seen considerable favoritism between the bartenders and certain patrons and while that is to be expected, when you're serving ten dollars cocktails in North Tonawanda some service is to be expected.   So we are seated and the dinner is going fine. The waiter was not bad but very mediocre; again, no smiles, no charm, but serviceable. He answered questions but didnt ask any or try to make recommendations.  My date had soup and a bass special, I had a burger. Now of course my order isn't seafood or fine dining, but it's on the menu and what I wanted so its fair game for review. I will not hedge my bets: I hate this restaurant, the atmosphere, the concept, the execution. I feel it is a lot of flash with zero substance. But everything I have put my lips to, with one exception soon to be mentioned, has been pretty darn tasty. Tonight was the same: soup tasty (portion under-served, cup about 2/3rds full), burger looked awful but was cooked just right, juicy and delicious. My date's fish was tasty. What wasn't good?  A monkey dish of cold dog pooh served with my burger. Awful, cold, and the waiter couldn't say what it was but did admit everyone hated it. Yet it was the only offering with the $12 burger. Fries, side salad, chips all ala carte, all that comes with the $12 burger is a dish of cold crud. I did order a side of fries. Delicious. But they were $7 and we were served enough for 3-4 persons. I asked during the ordering stage about fries and was told I had to order them separately. My date asked again, because she recalled having a sandwich served with fries at an earlier time. Both times the waiter wouldn't budge and even though he admitted the side dish was lousy he offered no alternatives.  I think there should be an option between a dish of crap and a $7 bucket of fries for 3-4 people. A $3 side of fries, reasonable. A handful fries on a plate, because we're sorry we gave you a dish of cold crap our customers have universally disdained, even better. I understand upscale dining. But consider this: a $12 burger, a $7 side of fries, and a $2 soda (I think soda is more) totals $21. After tax that's at least $22.47, and with just a 15% tip you're at $25.84. For a standard sized burger, a lot of fries, and some soda. At that level of upscale dining I expect some ambiance, some unique quality, and a lot of charm and personality from the staff. None of those things are offered by the Remington Tavern.  Where I was seated, the busboy knocked the back of my chair at least half a dozen times.  The staff was attentived but never smiled and lacked genuine concern. To my right were five younger persons that weren't I'll behaved but were up and down to the bar throughout the meal more like a Quick-Draw pub than a decent restaurant. That's not the Tavern's fault but it is part of what they offer. The Remington Tavern has no soul or substance.  It's like a beautiful woman with dead eyes and no heart. Please, don't let these people fool you into thinking they are top shelf just because someone familiar with Hutch's is involved and it's in a remodeled warehouse that makes you think of Manhattan. You're in North Tonawanda, and in addition to some good cooking you have to be nice, show customer appreciation, and offer value. Added thought: we paid with cash, and we needed smaller bills for the tip. Our change should have been $7.36 but the waiter just brought $7 cash. I get it, change is a nuisance. But as a business owner, if you are going to take the stance that change is a nuisance, I feel you have to take the high road and short change yourself. Now I'm not going to let some punk waiter reduce me to the point I have to ask management for 36 cents and a reasonable chance at French fries. But the short changing convinced me what I suspect of the Remington: there are people of questionable character running the place and their malevolence permeates the entire staff.  I'll starve before I do business with these types.
It's good food, but it's not great. You would think a place like this would take reservations on the weekend, but they don't. The wait once there wasn't terrible, but you are pretty much forced to stand at the crowded bar while your waiting. Once seated the waitress was very nice and the food was good. I kinda was expecting more but I would go back.
The atmosphere is excellent, the wine selection good and the beer selection is very good. Our server did everything possible to answer my array of questions about the seafood selections. The first course we ordered was the crispy calamari, this was one of the best fried calamari dishes I have had. The Thai sweet chili sauce was balanced nicely with fresh arugula and made the whole dish cohesive. Unfortunately that's where it ended. Our second course was the Grilled Oysters, while they were certainly fresh and tasty the oysters were simply passed over a wood fired grill to give some smokiness and were simply warm not actually cooked. The entrees continue the slide to average. My mother inlaw  had the steak sandwich, in itself was good but the kale salad it was served with was under flavored and lacked any acid to round it out(otherwise this would have been a complete dish). My wife and son split an order of the Bolognese which was over oily and greasy. My sister inlaw and I both had the striped bass which was very fresh and well cooked, the only problem with the dish was the grilled radicchio salad it was served with. This poor salad was so grilled it was charred and burnt making it more bitter than the raw radicchio itself, again a lack of any acid didn't help the salad either. All in all loved the atmosphere, the seafood was exceptionally fresh(especially for the area), the wine and beer lists get a thumbs up...but the food that has a great start really needs to be finished and more attention to detail needs to be addressed in order to make this a great dining experience.

Awesome food and awesome service.  The places looks great and has a great atmosphere.  The muscles and crab cakes were to die for!!

Beginning to end everything was great!  Great service great,hot, tasty food. We had the crabcake app, bolognese, scallops, and chocolate cake made in house. Great dinner and good time. We found our new favorite
Food served cold a two separate tries. Nothing worse than cold grouper-- twice. Portions seem a bit too small. Friend had the same experience two days later! Hopde the food isn't prepared ahead of time and frozen or refrigerated and just heated up for their guests?
The Remington Tavern does not accept reservations as of this review, and that was a problem. We arrived at 6:00, and put our names on a waiting list for a table for 2 -- the estimated wait was 20 minutes. 40 minutes later we were ready to give up and leave when I asked how much longer we'd have to wait and they decided to seat us. In the meantime, we noticed that the people handling the seating didn't seem to know what they were doing;at one point at least 5 employees were staring at the computer screen, apparently trying to figure out tables. We also noticed that parties of 4 got seated in front of couples -- if 2 of you show up and it's crowded, find another couple to share a table and you'll get seated sooner. The food, however was excellent. The grilled oysters were terrific, and reminded me of the hay-smoked oysters made famous by the Sansom Street Oyster House in Philadelphia. The sesame encrusted tuna was outstanding. We did not have desert, but the coffee was burnt and tasteless, perhaps the bottom of the pot. The noise level was aggravating. The center of the main floor is a large bar area, and with a high ceiling the noise gets oppressive. We'll go back, but not until they start taking reservations.
I love Remington Tavern for one reason, the Oysters!  I haven't found good raw oysters in Buffalo like I have here.  That being said when the waitress was telling me about the grilled, I wasn't ready to order that but my husband convinced me to try it.  Boy am I glad that I did.  If you don't like raw oysters thats ok, but you have to try the grilled!  It is out of this world!! oh and the dangerously delicious Martini.. is dangerously delicious another good part of the place.. other then that everything else is ok.  You don't have to worry about dressing up but if you want to you definitely can.
We stopped in at the start of their " soft opening" . The restaurant is a beautifully restored 19th century space, with large windows and a patio overlooking the canal. There is a good wine list, but only sweetened iced tea. The conch chowder was quite good, similar to a manhattan in style, yet spicier. The potato chunks were much firmer than I expected, but not undercooked. (Maybe cornbread instead of crackers...) Grilled salmon and shrimp were both well prepared and seasoned. The lobster po'boy, served on a poppy seed roll, had a good amount of claw meat and an excellent dill mayo. The side slaw was also very good. Save room for dessert. The sorbet sampler ( lemon, peach,and raspberry) and the red velvet cake ( with mocha gelato) were both winners. Service was attentive and friendly, and the chef more than happy to accommodate dietary restrictions. ( If you're looking forward to either the crab cake or the lobster dishes but are avoiding black pepper, let them know in advance.) The only negatives were the somewhat limited parking (their website says ample parking but I'm not sure where the other lot is) and the lack of a house brewed unsweetened (a tropical mango/ginger blend would be great) iced tea. We will absolutely be returning.
I went to Reminton's for the first time last night with my colleagues. We had a party of 5 and sat inside. Initially I waited at the bar for my party to arrive and enjoyed a delicious Pomegranate Martini. But it was $10.50. Crazy for a martini but it was awesome. Then we were seated inside and had a very nice, knowledgable waitress. The group wanted to order various appetizers which they enjoyed. I ate the fries appetizer which the dipping sauce was delicious. I am not a fan of certain seafood but my colleagues loved the appetizers. I had for my entree the Milanese Chicken Cutlet. It was topped with not only a beautiful arugula salad with tomato and Balsamic vinigarette but it was delectable. The chicken was good but it was breaded and was ok. Again 2 of my colleagues had the pork chop which they loved and scallops and some other seafood dish which they devoured. They followed their meal with dessert. I was too full. They had 3 different desserts, one was cheesecake to go, one was tart topped with fruit and the other I'm not sure but they loved it. Atmosphere was nice. A little loud at times but nice. Service was great and a nice crowd. They had a beautiful outdoor patio but that was a longer wait. I would definitely go back and recommend to anyone. Great experience.
I really enjoyed our dinner at The Remington Tavern and cannot wait to return. It has a great atmosphere and the staff is friendly. The restaurant was very busy for a Wednesday evening, which is always a good sign. The grilled oysters were outstanding! The menu is limited but that wouldn't have been an issue except they were out of a few of their staples, making it difficult to order. My boyfriend ordered the Swordfish and our waiter came back to say they had sold out, same story with the Tuna. Finally he was able to order the Salmon, it was good, just not what he wanted. Our waiter was knowledgable and was able to answer all our questions about the restaurant and where the seafood came from. The price was reasonable.
I don't eat seafood but I do love this place. I wish they had a few pasta or vegetarian dishes on the menu. My husband raves about the seafood. The French martini is always perfect. Had something called a cookie cup dessert last night that was incredible. Berries and fresh whipped creme in an almond honey biscotti dish. The hostess and manager were very nice. Our server, Amanda and busboy Riley were excellent.
Drinks are over priced !!!!!! The Service was lousy !!!!!!! The food wasn't  that great  //// which is also over priced  !!!! I mean lets face it this north Tonawanda  if want to pay those prices ILL go to the Buffalo Chop house !!!  Just wasn't very impressed my wife had a chicken caesar salad  & i have to say I make it  better at home the restaurant is a very nice looking place but thats where it ends for me won't go back & would not recommend this to anyone.
Blah. First of all the place looks beautiful, so well done there. The ambiance of d-bag, however, permeates. If you're into that kind of thing though, and I know there out there just waiting to be "seen", then head on over for some good but not amazing food. Started with the calamari (once we figured out which specials menu to order from because we got two different ones from another night), it was very good. Then came the salad wedge. A wedge is a wedge is a wedge. I still don't understand why they are on so many menus. Gumbo- not good, if you're going to make gumbo, make it good or don't bother. Flavor was off and there wasn't much substance. Steak- cooked perfectly but didn't knock me over with flavor. Altogether, I expected much more from this place. Maybe they're still "working out the kinks"? Will I go back to find out or recommend you do? No. There other places in Buffalo that deliver EVERY time.......oh yeah the service. Bar staff horrible, host confused and waitress excellent.
I could get addicted to their grilled oysters.   Positively the best I've had north of NOLA.  Love the atmosphere.  They still have some service issue to work out.  But the oysters will have me coming back.
I recently visited the Remington Tavern with a group of friends for a birthday celebration. I was immediately impressed by the interior and decor - the space has an industrial vibe, but is still warm and modern.  I'm a fan of restaurants that you can frequent for either appetizers or a full meal.  With a stellar raw bar, beautiful and spacious bar, and tasty appetizer menu, the Remington Tavern falls into this category. Our group grabbed a table by the bar and shared a variety of appetizers and offerings from the raw bar.  Everything was fresh, well prepared, and of high quality. The oysters were the best I've tried locally, and the almond shrimp and mussels were delicious! The only disappointment was a bland clam soup. The deserts we ordered were phenomenal- a pumpkin cheesecake with a crunchy pumpkin seed brittle, and an apple tart.  But back to those oysters... seriously, If you are a seafood fan, or oyster-lover, this place will quickly become a favorite!
Had another excellent meal here. Friendly staff and excellent menu choices. We sat at the bar and started with a half dozen "summer side" oysters. After one we look at each other and wonder why didn't we go for a full doz?! We did, consistent preparation and flavor. All going well with a couple of glasses of muscadet, nice start! Next we enjoyed the wedge salad and added grilled shrimp, nice touch, and the hearty clams casino.. Soo much flavor! Not over breaded like most do. Very enjoyable.. We were torn between a few items to share for entree, since we know the pork chop is one of the best we've had, it's very hard to get away from. But we chose the Alaskan Copper Salmon. Wow, we'll cooked, about mr+ and had the most flavor of any salmon I've enjoyed. Almost sweet, and perfectly cooked. I honestly wanted my own! Dessert we chose the warmed brownie with vanilla gelato, perfecto! A sweet guy, I would have preferred one more scoop of gelato:) This place always tops the last visit. Love sitting at the big bar meeting people and hearing all their ooh's & ahh's.. Big time restaurant w/o big prices. Many ways to enjoy your night at Remington Tavern.
Beginning to end everything was great!  Great service great,hot, tasty food. We had the crabcake app, bolognese, scallops, and chocolate cake made in house. Great dinner and good time. We found our new favorite

I could get addicted to their grilled oysters.   Positively the best I've had north of NOLA.  Love the atmosphere.  They still have some service issue to work out.  But the oysters will have me coming back.
I recently visited the Remington Tavern with a group of friends for a birthday celebration. I was immediately impressed by the interior and decor - the space has an industrial vibe, but is still warm and modern.  I'm a fan of restaurants that you can frequent for either appetizers or a full meal.  With a stellar raw bar, beautiful and spacious bar, and tasty appetizer menu, the Remington Tavern falls into this category. Our group grabbed a table by the bar and shared a variety of appetizers and offerings from the raw bar.  Everything was fresh, well prepared, and of high quality. The oysters were the best I've tried locally, and the almond shrimp and mussels were delicious! The only disappointment was a bland clam soup. The deserts we ordered were phenomenal- a pumpkin cheesecake with a crunchy pumpkin seed brittle, and an apple tart.  But back to those oysters... seriously, If you are a seafood fan, or oyster-lover, this place will quickly become a favorite!
Had another excellent meal here. Friendly staff and excellent menu choices. We sat at the bar and started with a half dozen "summer side" oysters. After one we look at each other and wonder why didn't we go for a full doz?! We did, consistent preparation and flavor. All going well with a couple of glasses of muscadet, nice start! Next we enjoyed the wedge salad and added grilled shrimp, nice touch, and the hearty clams casino.. Soo much flavor! Not over breaded like most do. Very enjoyable.. We were torn between a few items to share for entree, since we know the pork chop is one of the best we've had, it's very hard to get away from. But we chose the Alaskan Copper Salmon. Wow, we'll cooked, about mr+ and had the most flavor of any salmon I've enjoyed. Almost sweet, and perfectly cooked. I honestly wanted my own! Dessert we chose the warmed brownie with vanilla gelato, perfecto! A sweet guy, I would have preferred one more scoop of gelato:) This place always tops the last visit. Love sitting at the big bar meeting people and hearing all their ooh's & ahh's.. Big time restaurant w/o big prices. Many ways to enjoy your night at Remington Tavern.
