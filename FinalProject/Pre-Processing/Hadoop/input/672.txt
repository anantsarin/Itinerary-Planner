I have tried yoga off and on throughout the years without much success. This year, my new years resolution was to try again and commit to a series of classes. I went to a beginning class at The Breathing Room at the suggestion of a friend and am hooked. Krista's excellent teaching style makes yoga easy and understandable. I don't feel so clumsy anymore. I look forward to the class every week and feel refreshed and rejuvenated after each one. The Breathing Room has given me a whole new outlook on yoga and I look forward to years of increasingly more difficult poses!
I checked this studio out a few weeks ago at the 90 minute Monday night class. The teacher was very friendly and everyone in the class was very nice and welcoming. I thought the flow of the class was perfect. We spent enough time stretching and exploring each posture, but not so much time that I was bored or waiting to move on. We were given a lot of options, so I tried a new pose (sideways crow), but stayed in my comfort zone for others. The teacher gave a lot of helpful tips. I parked in the public lot by the funeral home next door. All around a lovely experience. I would definitely go back. The class was $18, which I felt was a bit expensive since I had never been before, but after taking it, I feel it was worth the money.
I love yoga at the Breathing Room. The space is peaceful. But it is the teachers that rock! I followed Camille here, but Krista is so happy and friendly! And both classes I have had with Matt have been both physically and emotionally stretching. My life would be much less without yoga at the Breathing Room.
