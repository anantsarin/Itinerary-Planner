Went here for a late lunch with a friend over the weekend. What a wonderful little restaurant! The service was amazing and the food was delicious, and especially fresh. I had a 1/2 sandwich and 1/2 salad for lunch and it was perfect! The restaurant is tucked away in a beautiful and quiet residential neighborhood so you may need your GPS to find it the first time! They have a few tables outside and it's very pleasant to eat there. I don't know if they allow smoking outside I did not ask them. They do not serve any alcohol but you can bring beer or wine for a small corkage fee. I will definitely be back and highly recommend this location!!
Ain't nothing like a southern homemade dinner that you didn't have to cook. Amen! Homemade southern fried chicken! Yes! Let your inner fat kid out now! It's cooked to order so be prepared for a wait. But the wait will be well worth it when you are delivered a plate of golden crispy chicken that is juicy and tender inside. The sides were okay, nothing special outside of the green beans. Something about the way they were cooked gave me images of women sitting on a porch with over sized aprons washing beans. Either way they were delicious. Plenty of southern charm. When traveling with an indecisive and picky eater, they are still able to deliver great food. If you're not a meat eater there are vegetarian options. And I was told they will cook for dieters needs. Just let them know your restrictions when ordering. Authentic southern cuisine from a super sweet staff.
We've eaten here three times so far and each time is just as good as the last. As they'll tell you, everything is made in house and the only thing in the freezer is ice cream. Everything is fresh and you can definitely tell. Their fried chicken (only available on Wed and Sat) is really good, same for the fried pork chop and their chicken & dumplings (available on Tuesday). The vegetables are always fresh, they even cut the corn off the cob! You can't go wrong here. Definitely one of our new favorite places.
I was recently here for a Yelp Elite event. My very first one and I'm very satisfied with it being my first one. I only have one complaint about this place! Which I'm going to start out with first because I have so many great things to say about this place. With such high ceilings I believe it may get a little loud. Now that may only be because the whole restaurant was packed out for this event. I'll for sure be going back though so perhaps it'll be a little less loud. We were able to sample some really great items off of Simply Sara's Menu. My favorite had to be the family recipe of Sausage Corn Chowder. My husband doesn't usually like flavor corn gives off in dishes but he kept saying how delicious it was. I was a little depressed he liked it because I would have liked his serving.. Another highlight item on our menu was the eggplant fries with a house made chipotle ranch dipping sauce. mmmm during conversation we just kept eating them. Honorable mentions were of course the fried chicken and gravy. NOW I do work at Maple Street so I can't say this is the best gravy but it was pretty darn good. The chicken was sooo crispy. Yum Yum texture. I would have liked a little bit more salt on the chicken but I think because it was paired with gravy they didn't want to over do it. The place was super clean, well organized, and staff was all very friendly and all family! Sara and her family got up at the end of our event to give a little bit more information about the place. I'm all about why someone starts a business and where their hearts are at. Their hearts are in all the right places and they were truly grateful for all of us there. (They came in on their day off!) They go to the farmers market at least three times a week to hand pick ingredients. Which means a changing menu. They even mentioned how they're starting to make their own deli meat. Impressive! I'll for sure be back, especially for the soup.
I first came here for a Yelp event, so I brought a co-worker back to give it a shot. The food for the Yelp event was outstanding, so the test was would it be just as good on a non-event day. When we arrived there was no one there to greet us....hmmmm.  Okay, we waited a few minutes and a waitress came and told is we could pick out seats. Food was like a family picnic, pimento and cheese, country fried steak sandwiches, pulled pork, well you get the picture. My co-worker and I chose sandwiches with a side of cucumber salad. I hate cucumbers but I love their cucumber and tomato salad. Service was not stellar, but it was friendly and efficient. When I told someone I had been to Simply Sara's they said ,"You have to try the cheeseburger"......okay, next visit.
So, it was a long way to go for our YE event at Simply Sara, 18 miles to be precise.  However, it was definitely worth the journey! I love family owned business where the entire family gets into the action and make the patrons feel like family themselves...it's a lost art unfortunately.   Anyway on the food; Simply Sara is a southern cooking establishment, but what I love most about it, besides the great fried chicken and gravy, is the fact that it's all fresh made and locally sourced. Sara and James a regulars at our local farmers market and you can definitely taste it in the quality of the food. I want to thank Sara, James and their girls for making us feel welcome and for providing us with great tasting comfort food. I will definitely be back and will be parading the word.
My wife and I stopped by for lunch today.  I had the turkey club.  It came with their potato chips.  My wife had the chicken salad sandwich.  We shared an egg nog pound cake for dessert. All their food is home-made and local.  It's a bit pricey but worth it.  We'll definitely go back. The neighborhood around the restaurant is great.  You'll need your GPS if your not familiar with the area but you'll want to explore it after you eat.
It was very good for fresh Southern fare. The service was wonderful. They seated us and it felt as if we were going into someone's home. Everything was very clean and everyone was very pleasant. We ordered the chicken entrée and the meatloaf, black-eyed peas, tomato and cucumber salad, with eggplant fries as an appetizer. I've never had eggplant fries but they were fantastic! They were served with fresh homemade ranch dressing and I just couldn't get enough. The black-eyed peas seemed more like field peas but we could tell that they were fresh. The food is very fresh and well cooked and not over seasoned. The owner came and spoke to us several times. Our food was served by the cook. Our server was fantastic. It was just a great experience overall. We shared peach cobbler with vanilla ice cream for dessert. The cobbler was warm and made with fresh peaches. The ice cream was so creamy and good. And Best of all we were given cookies to bring home. We will definitely be back!
Awesome little family owned diner with the best southern food. A nice clean casual atmosphere, family friendly. I started with the pimento cheese appetizer, fresh made and delicious. My entree was the chicken fried chicken with pole beans. The service was top notch. I was complemented with a few cookies for desert. This is a place worth visiting
This was the easiest 5 stars I have ever given. They make a simply the best fried chicken and all the delicious and authentic sides one can wish for.
Now we had a really good time last night at the Elite Event. So mush we traveled out to Sara's again. As soon as we enter everybody was saying hi how are you and welcome back. We were made to feel like family. The same family that served us some really good food last night. I really wanted to find out if last night's meal was a fluke. NOPE this place is legit. Everything tasted so fresh and cooked perfectly. Now I'm not a push over on how to prepared food. I love to cook myself and they cook a lot better then I do. The hit of the meal last night was the gravy for the wife. So tonight I thought I would put them to the test. A steak. It's really hard to cook a steak better then I do but James did a really good job tonight. My steak was cooked perfectly just the way I liked it. The wife ordered the chicken n dumplings. She loved the gravy from last night. In fact when I asked where she wanted to eat tonight she told me Sara's it's chicken n dumpling night. I really can't say enough about Sara and James and the whole family. We are just so glad for Allie, Diana, and Yelp let letting us know about Simply Saras. Thanks and we will be back. PS. I want an invite for the next Gravy Throwdown !!!!
My First yelp event. Great atmosphere, friendly staff, good food. Eggplant fries with Cajun ranch were amazing, biscuits and gravy also awesome, fried chicken could use some marinating as it didn't have much flavor, but it was perfectly cooked, juicy, and when dipped in the gravy provided, very tasty. I was not a big fan of the pulled pork, but I think it's because it was probably that I'm more used a smoked pork. Overall great experience and I would definitely visit again.
They are off the beaten path, but they are so worth finding. The food is all fresh. No canned or frozen. I now eat there several times a week. The menu changing on different nights is fun. I love the fried chicken, hamburgers and eggplant fries appetizer. How did I ever live without eggplant fries? Love Saturday morning gravy as well. The never rush us out and we are treated like family.
Whoohoo the chicken and dumplings has that finger lickin good gravy all over it! That's Truly THE BEST gravy ever! The squash casserole was good, but the sweet potato and apple casserole was better! I was my desert! All and all this place is a gem for Yumminess, see y'all next Monday!
What a treasure! The owners could not be nicer, the food couldn't be fresher (no microwaves or canned/frozen food here -- or even anything processed/from Sysco), or the location (it's an old 1930s historic Ortega building) any more quaint. And the chicken could not be any more moist and juicy. All around fabulous home-cooked meal. P.S. Save room for a square of the secret Milky Way cake -- so light and fluffy and all around delicious. Our two slices disappeared rather quickly.
So confused by the great reviews. Maybe it was what we ordered? Maybe it was because it was lunch? The waitress forgot our soup and forgot the bacon on my turkey bacon club. Not sure how it was a club considering it was turkey and bacon only. My husband got the chicken fried chicken thinking it would have gravy or be pretty special in some way, but nope, again it was pretty boring.
Please read the whole review. As you know by now, having moved to Jvlle in Sept, I've been using Yelp as my "guide" to restaurants, ESPECIALLY when we have a hankerin' for something. Good Ol Southern cooking was what we wanted on Friday night. We drove over from Mandarin to this quaint little place, seemingly in the middle of this very large neighborhood. We knew from the reviews it was fresh, limited menu however we did not know specifically that Fridays was Seafood night AND they were out of shrimp (half the menu was shrimp or had shrimp and it was only 7:30). Needless to say we were disappointed, one because we wanted southern cooking, we could've gotten seafood at Sam's St Johns ***** and two seafood night without shrimp it kind of pointless especially at such and early hour. 9-10 I get, 7:15-7:30 ummm someone dropped the ball...I respect the fresh and daily market a lot but honestly no shrimp on seafood night, early, is mismanagement or just being cheap. WITH THAT BEING SAID... Read further. Tucked away on their seafood menu was a grilled boneless skinless chicken plate with 3 sides. My wife and I both got that. It was by far the best chicken I've eaten in a restaurant. The collards were fresh and excellent. The corn was fresh and excellent. The cheese grits were good and the sweet tea was good. The sides were true southern fare, grilled chicken isn't but THE best I've had in a restaurant. We will go back for Fried chicken (wed/sat) nights. The service was "OK", not exceptional but suffice. I will say that the place was loaded with older patrons (65+) and they were complaining (knit picking every little thing) and running the staff ragged. Food  ***** excellent Price  ***    $20 Head Avg Svc.   ****   Decent Loc.   ***     Tucked away, not central
Simply average. Went there for lunch with some friends and none of us were impressed with the food.  There are too many other places in the area that provide better options at less cost.
We were here at the Yelp Event about a week ago and the experience was great!  I really enjoyed the corn and sausage chowder the most however the pimento cheese and cracker appetizer was great!  I really appreciated that the owners of Simply Saras were never in the business before now.  I think the southern food and hospitality make for an awesome experience.
We tried Simply Sara's tonight... Finally! Honestly, we always forget about it because it is so out of the way, but I'm really glad we remembered it!  The food is really great and everything is fresh. My husband loved the Mahi Mahi.  I only gave it 4 stars and not 5 because there's no alcohol and not many vegetarian options.  I would have loved to have a glass of wine with my pizza.  So glad to have this place in the neighborhood! Will definitely be going back.
This restaurant is tucked away in sweet Ortega Village, just a few blocks off US17 (Roosevelt Boulevard) in Ortega. The owners, the Mangham family, are wonderful, friendly, hard-working folks, and boy, can they cook!! Fried chicken, chicken & dumplings, home-cooked vegetables, salads, sandwiches, fish and more ... the servings are generous, and everything is tasty. If you've heard about Simply Sara's but haven't tried it yet, please do. They started their business at a Murray Hill location, which was small, so they specialized in take-out. They still have a thriving take-out business (very handy!), but the charming interior of this old "flatiron" building will draw you in. It's very homey, with old family photos adorning the walls, and Sara and James and their kids keep the place humming. Give it a try!
Excellent home cooking and amazing service. We had to book a rehearsal dinner last minute after our original plans fell through and Sara and her husband were extremely accommodating for us. They went above and beyond to make us feel at home and I can't begin to thank them enough. And honestly the food can speak for itself .. our guests were unanimously pleased with every aspect. Highly recommended and  we can't wait to eat there again!
The service was incredible and the shrimp and grits were both outstanding! You have to try the peach cobbler, it is FABULOUS.
Farmer's Market Fresh local vegetables and Seafood. Sinful desserts. Cakes made to order. Dine in or carry out lunch and dinner.
This location has moved to, 2902 Corinthian Avenue, in Ortega.
Have been here twice for lunch, excellent both times. First time had Chicken and Dumplings (rib sticking delicious) and second time a classic PB&J sandwich with homemade strawberry/pineapple jam. On my first trip, received half a dozen fresh baked cookies for free! Cookies are fantastic, a great hidden spot. A bit pricey, but worth it.
Heard about this place this morning from a friend so we decided to give it a try. Man I am so glad that we did it is really something special. It is located in the middle of Old Ortega and everything that they make is from scratch, nothing from cans. The vegetables are so fresh and good it's almost like eating something from your own garden. My son ordered the eggplant fries with homemade ranch sauce and I was blown away by how good they were (I wasn't a big fan of eggplant before I tried these) we then ordered our meal. I got the country fried steak and was very impressed as it was actually fork tender and delicious, I also got the fresh green beans and the knife cut corn off the cob (both fantastic. My son ordered the exact same thing. My wife ordered the grilled chicken breast with the corn and a fresh fruit cup and was very happy with that as well. I tried a bite of the chicken and found it to be very tender, full of flavor and juicy.
Southern style food at great prices.  I have picked up to-go orders several times and really enjoyed everything I've ordered: chicken and dumplings, pot roast, soup, etc.  Great cookies too!
