Somehow my review remains filtered by Yelp even though I assure you I am a regular restaurant patron, not a competitor or saboteur.   The Heights is really not a great restaurant.  The portions are too large, the food has been overthought, the combinations are poor.  The service is wonderful, the staff always cordial, but this is not a top-notch restaurant anywhere other than Ithaca, New York.
I  took a client to the Heights Cafe & Grill while visiting the Ithaca area recently and was quite pleased with the overall experience. The staff was very accommodating and professional during a business lunch that lasted longer than I anticipated - even though the restaurant seemed fairly busy, our meals were served to our party of eight in an orderly fashion and we never felt rushed.  The food from start to finish was delicious and I plan to visit this spot the next time I am in the area.
I agree with Spyros. I came up here from NYC and thought this was very expensive. And I wasn't sure if the service was slow or if they were being overly polite but the dishes came very slow in the beginning... but then picked up. The food is fancy but good. They start you off with an olive sourdough and slices of pita bread, hummus as well as basamic and olive oil for dip.  We enjoyed the bread so much that we asked for 2nds and the waiter didn't flinch which is nice. The appetizers were much more inspired and so I ordered 2 for my dinner, a risotto and a scallop/shrimp dish in curry which turned out also to be on risotto. Surprisingly, the 2 risotto were cooked differently. I enjoyed the overcooked one in curry vs. the al dente risotto dish which seemed to be lacking in flavor and quite oily. We also had the calamari which was had a good crust but was ever so slightly on the chewy side. And finally, we had the tenderloin, which was very good and tender. I just had the leftover loin for dinner and it was still very good. I would have like to tried dessert, but there was no room.
My dining companions and I had an excellent dinner here.  We indulged in sweetbreads and beet salad for an opener, and I opted for the fanciest chicken parmesan I've ever encountered. It was a giant slab of chicken over a bed of really tasty gnocchi.  The fried egg on top seemed strange at first, but was a very nice touch! Since there was so much going on in town, it was impossible to get a cab back to our hotel.  The nicest server from Beijing offered to drive us back to our hotel on her way home!  Her kindness and generosity is what the fifth star is for!
The food was superb here.  Meatball appetizer was a BIG hit.  I like that they offer two sizes for martinis!  Most of us had seafood for our main courses, and everybody's was good.  One diner had their hamburger, and it was superb (and huge).  The chocolate dessert was well worth ordering in advance. I didn't "love" the atmosphere.  Kind of sterile.  But solid food for sure.
I was in Ithaca recently for an interview and my hosts took me out to lunch at The Heights.  I was definitely impressed!  The menu here is exquisite.  It was hard to decide on only one entree.  The food was amazing, and the presentation was first class.  The staff was very attentive to our needs and the service was what you expect from a top notch establishment. Everything here is over the top.  Even the coffee came out with an assortment of add-ins.  In addition to the usual creme and sugar, there were sticks of rock candy, cinnamon sticks, and chocolate chips served on a platter.  For dessert?  I can't even do justice to the desserts without a picture.  I can say that if you order the chocolate cake, be prepared to bring it home in a to-go box.  One piece of this decadent creation is easily enough for 4 patrons.  I have never seen anything like it.
Arranged a reunion dinner for 20 people there on a Saturday night when their private dining room was already booked.  I'm still getting positive comments from my friends who attended.  Several mentioned that it was the best dinner for a group that size that they'd attended.  We all got to order from the full menu.  The food was wonderful.  They gave us two big tables in a room of our own and served us all with ease and grace.  I had the saltimbocca.  It was a huge portion and I am ashamed to say I ate all of it.  One of my friends did switch his order to the duck special (breast and confit, which he loved) when informed that the rib-eye was 40 ounces.  My vegetarian friend said she loved all the options and they did a simple fruit dessert for her at her request. It couldn't have worked out better.
This is probably the most expensive restaurant in Ithaca. It is also the classiest and the one with the best wine list. But is it really worth it? The environment is warm but austere and the staff are very professional without being particularly friendly (adding  to the austerity of the place). You usually start your meal at the Heights with bread and olive oil and balsamic vinegar or olive spread. Appetizers are the best part of the meal at the Heights Cafe, since they are usually really inspired and amazingly executed.   The entrees though are the weak point of the restaurant. Most of them are so big that you can take them home and have two more meals. What is the point in that? Really none. Anyway, avoid at all cost the signature steak which is a mediocre porterhouse. If steak is what you wanted you should have gone to John Thomas. The rest of the entrees are really nothing special and definitely not worth the price. Finally, the deserts are really nice but most people never have space for that by that time. The chocolate lave cake is really recommended. Also, I have  to mention a couple of bad incidents that happened. Once a member of our company ordered duck which came quite uncooked and was impossible to be cut. When we complained to the waitere, he took the piece of meat and took it to the kitchen to be grilled further! No apology of course.... In another visit, the waiter brought the wrong entree to one of my friends and of course he took it back and came 20 minutes later with the correct one. No apology again of course...
This is probably the fanciest restaurant I have ever been too. I came here with my family after my college graduation. It was recommended to me by the dean of the school of Hospitality and Hotel Management at Cornell University, so I knew it had to be good. The service was impeccable and the food was far beyond my expectations. I had a swordfish special and everyone else had different types of steaks. Everyone in the group was very pleased (except maybe my dad, after he got the check...). Don't expect to spend any less than $50 a person for food and drinks. The Heights loses one star simply because of it's location. For such a high class restaurant, the ambience leaves much to be desired. Ithaca is such a beautiful place that it's hard to believe the owner's could not find a place with a better view (or any view for that matter). Also, it is not a good place for kids, especially picky ones.
Don't let the strip mall façade fool you, after all, how many strip-mall-located restaurants offer valet parking?  I made last minute reservations for dinner here on a Thursday night. The host greeted us at the door and offered to hang my jacket. The ambience was quiet and dimly lit.  The atmosphere seemed a bit stuffy (we're in a strip mall for heaven's sake!) but a glass of wine will clear that right up. We started off with complementary olive bread and pitas served with hummus and vinegar/oil dip. For the appetizer, we ordered the calamari which had a sweet tomato relish on the bottom. The calamari had a perfect harmony of squiggly tentacles and O-rings. Each dinner item comes with a huge plate of salad. I had the house special which included mandarin oranges, arugula, beets and walnuts drizzled with vinaigrette. Salad accompaniments are rarely memorable; however, I really enjoyed mine. I ordered the fish of the day, Branzino (similar to sea bass) with a mushroom/onion white wine sauce served with potatoes and capers. I loved my fish; however, my dining partner was irked because the fish was served with its tail. My friend ordered the Salmon special (which thankfully came with no tail) which he thoroughly enjoyed and the other friend ordered Beef short ribs, which came in a generous portion. In retrospect every dish served was more than a generous portion. Service was excellent as the waiter made sure that our water and wine glasses were always full. We ordered one bottle of wine ($55) and our bill came out to a little over $200.   Each entrée was around $36, yes it is a bit high so it's probably not some place you'd frequent without parents, an expense card or a rich old (wo)man present.
I first had dinner at The Heights 4 yrs. ago when my son was a freshman at Cornell. My impression then was that the restaurant is overpriced for the quality of the overall experience. I have found this true of most of the top rated Ithaca restaurants. I waited 3 yrs. to try it again.  Same impression.  The food offerings are average-above avg. For the price point, I expect more than a white paper ring around the cutlery, which was school cafeteria quality.  My fork had bent tines due to the cheap metal it was made of.  I ordered a bottle of wine for $42 and later found it for $8 online. Most restaurants price wine 3 times retail, not over 5 times. Overall, OK food but for the price, expect more of the overall experience.
If you're in the mood to feel like a republican and grouse about your marginal tax rate then go to the Heights Cafe, where the food is rich and so are the customers; there's a real country club feel.  Although it is not a steakhouse, there is an emphasis on red meat with 4 printed menu choices (the tederloin, the signature steak, the rib eye and the short rib) and a quotidian special (last friday was veal).  Then again there's lots of fish - same deal as the beef with 4 printed choices (halibut, salmon, sea bass and a fish of the day) and a daily special (yes, in addition to the fish of the day).  What I'm trying to say is this:  lots of choices.  Because in addition to all this red meat and fish The Heights offers pork chops, laquered duck, rack of lamb, a vegetarian napoleon, even pizzas.  And the wine list includes well over 100 choices, $45 and up per bottle (up to an eye popping $250 for a meritage). So how is it?  The place is expensive by Ithaca's standards - about $35 per entree, which includes a prosaic salad (either caesar or greens).  The rest of my dinner, however, was superb.  I ordered the beef short ribs which played lead to a supporting cast of bacon, potato gnocchi and broccoli rabe.  Wow!  The ribs were cut in the flanken style and wonderful.  But the bacon stole the show.  It was not what I expected, but instead a thick slab of pork fat woven through with generous threads of what we (or at least I) think of as bacon.  In fact this bacon was like bacon in reverse.  Instead of a predominance of cured crispy pork belly with a trim of white fat this was a predominance of white fat with an interior trim of cured crispy pork belly.  But whatever (and how is pork belly not fat I can hear some of you say); it was delicious.  I can't believe I ate the whole thing.  So the food at least was five-star. Less impressive was the flatware (boring and lacking heft), the glassware (a bit dusty) and the service (what? you can't memorize the specials).  Dessert, back to the actual food, was good (though not thrilling) as we split an appley bread pudding with a scoop of ordinary iced cream.  Although we were sharing we were each given our own plate, which was thoughtful, although somehow not as much as fun.  I also had espresso (well done) and drambuie (not so much), served as it was in a glass both ridiculous and impractical (how about a snifter?). The excellence of the entree, however, made this an experience worth the price, which is saying quite a lot (at least here in our little town).
Thinking about this place makes me drool! I ate here about a year ago with my boyfriend for our 2-year anniversary and it was delicious. I got the Flame Grilled Lamb Loin Chops and he got the Signature Steak. We also ordered an appetizer...we can't remember what it was, but everything we ate and drank that night was amazing. The wine selection is great, it was fun to have such a wide variety of wines to pair with our entrees. For dessert I got the Mixed Berry Tart and the portion was huge, definitely enough for two people. I also got the Italian Coffee, and oooh it was the perfect dessert drink. The whole setup that it comes with is so perfect; a cute little rock candy swizzle, a cinnamon stick, and a little carafe of Strega so you can make it as strong as you want. Anyways, it was perfect for a special evening out or just when you really want top-notch food. Even compared to big city restaurants the Heights is up there with the best. The service was great; the staff was friendly but not pretentious. Our only complaint about the night is we were seated at a two top in the middle of the room. As my restaurant design Professor once said, "Never put a floating deuce in your restaurant!" (if this has ever happened to you, you know it's incredibly awkward). Good thing we weren't on a first date, so we just laughed it off and got lost in our own conversation! The Heights is a truly gourmet experience served with Ithaca charm. And, if I might add, it's a great value compared to its urban counterparts. Can't wait til the next time I'm back in Ithaca and am no longer a broke college student!
Read good reviews on Yelp. Found the food at The Heights pricey. Don't order an appetizer unless you are sharing it with others.  They are large, and after the bread, salad and appetizer, I was nearly full. I had the Costa Rican black beans and rice; it was great, and I took 2/3 of it home.  The mixed green salad was fresh, and had a scrumptious lemon basil dressing. My swordfish special was $39, so it was a shame that I could only eat half before it was too much. There was a colossal shrimp on top, but it didn't seem all that fresh; I did use a ginger dipping sauce with it.   And as noted by others, ordering coffee is fun.  The coffee itself is very good, and a plate of add-ins makes it quite the experience! Service was attentive and professional.  Things were served at a reasonable pace, water constantly filled, silver frequently exchanged.  It was good, but not superior, considering the price.
I use to be a regular for lunch, good food...
Oh my gawsh. I don't think I have ever been so impressed by a restaurant in terms of the overall experience - decor, food, presentation, atmosphere, service - especially in Ithaca. The first thing you can tell about this place is that it is chic and modern, and although a lot of people have said there's a country club feel to the place, I would say it seems a bit more modern than that. It was slightly weird because the restaurant itself is so formal that most of the people eating were businessmen and much older people. So my friends and I sat down at our table to order, and then the waitress brought out the much hyped hummus/olive oil and fresh pita chips/olive bread. Dude, you cannot stop eating those things, and if anything, that was the best hummus I have ever tasted in my entire life. The pitas and olive bread are freshly baked and they even make their own hummus. If anything, just come here for the hummus. I also heard something about the meatball appetizer, but I think they took it off the menu because it wasn't there. Darn. I look through the menu, everything is pretty pricey as expected (30-40+). All of us ended up ordering steak dishes even though I heard the seafood dishes were great, which is a shame because I love seafood. I got the special house steak (t-bone), my friends got prime rib, braised short ribs, and a special flanked steak. I chose to get the field salad which came with the steak, and even the salad tasted great. Eventually, my steak came out. The presentation of these dishes were beyond what I was used to. My dish literally looked like a work of art, and it sure tasted like one. The meat was so tender and succulent, it was worth every single dollar. Also, the portions were ginormous. My steak was like 38 oz. Ridiculous, right? I'll guarantee you, with the free bread and huge portions, there's no way you can leave this place hungry. The service was also excellent, the waitress was really friendly and very available. I felt sort of bad actually because we had our bread basket refilled like ten times. Man, this place lived up to its hype for sure, in fact it far surpassed it. If you've heard of the Heights, you've probably also heard of John Thomas Steakhouse. Both are fantastic high-end/steak restaurants, but with completely different feels. JT's plays upon its location in the countryside with a more homey/barnyard feeling (which by no means is a bad or informal atmosphere, but very unique). Also, the portions are quite smaller and JT's is about 10-20 dollars more expensive per dish. Yet, the Heights is more along the lines of somewhere you'd want to take a girl out on the first date. It's sure to impress, with better variety, and helping sizes. Although JT's used to be my favorite restaurant in Ithaca, the Heights has made a very compelling case. Sorry JT's, the Heights is my favorite now.
Excellent, high quality food. Very fresh. Whole menu looked appealing. Not greasy at all. Attentive service and food came out in less than 15 minutes. One of the best restaurants in Ithaca.
This is supposed to be the best restaurant in Ithaca.  It's just OK because the value is off.  It's rather pricey, especially so for Ithaca, with entrees in the $30 range.  The décor is bland and uninteresting and uninspiring. Started with the Costa Rican Beef with Polenta Fries and the Fried Calamari appetizers.  Both were good, especially the beef, which had zesty flavors.  The calamari was of a good quality and it was a huge portion; three of us didn't even finish it.   Getting the appetizers turned out to be a mistake because the entrees came with salads, which OK. An interesting menu.  Chose for one entrée the Jumbo Sea Scallops & Spring Vegetables.  It was very large, but not too good.  The flavors of all the different stuff in the dish didn't work together.  The other entrée was sea bass with shaved Brussels sprouts - I think there was one sprout that was shaved.  The fish was of good quality and well prepared.
Such a fabulous meal!  Generous portions and an innovative menu.  Wasn't expecting much since its just on the side of a strip mall but the service and quality was outstanding.  Quiet atmosphere.
If you are in Ithaca NY, this is likely as good as it gets. It is a high end restaurant, with high quality food, and with that, guess what you get high prices :-) Though in all honesty not high for the quality of food and service. When most of the restaurants are geared towards college students, it is nice to have a REAL establishment like this. Lastly, their catering for large events (eg wedding) is amazing too.
Just a short drive from the Cornell North campus, The Heights offers a wonderful dining experience. The seafood was well seasoned and prepared, the wine list is among the best in the area, and the lava cake is deliciously sinful. The best, however, is the hand cut steaks. They're exceptional, and large enough to share.
The Heights cafe is a nice little restaurant with good food. It isn't quite my cup of tee (its a little too fancy for me) I have my office Christmas party there. Excellent service, nice atmosphere, a bit pricey, but overall a nice place to eat.
Great meal.  Bread and spreads were fabulous.  Had mozzerella app and sirloin. Wife had Bronzino.  It was well done.
My wife and I first ate at Heights Cafe on July 22, 2009. You can read our Review on Trip Advisor entitled, "An excellent dining experience." It took three years, but we finally made it back in the Finger Lakes for a vacation, and we went out of our way to return to the Heights Cafe on July 6, 2012. I tried to dampen my own expectations, because I didn't think there was any way this meal could be as good as the first. It was, in fact, even better! We had met Chef-Owner James Larounis on our first visit, and after a bit of prompting he recalled meeting us. Soon the printed menus were gone and James was ordering a "guided tour" of the menu for us. Incredibly food. We ordered liberally from the oustanding (and attractively priced) wine list, leaving some for the staff to try after close. Heights Cafe does not have all those Wine Spectator awards for no reason. What a night!
Good food but not amazing and price definitely did not justify it. Pretty venue.
I've only been here once and I had a not-so-great experience.  It was a Saturday and there was a reception in the main dining area so the only place for a table was in the dining room.  The hostess was very nice and probably the only reason why I'm giving this place 3 stars.  However, since I was there with my boyfriend, we were sandwiched in a very small table next to a 9 people dining party.  One of the guys there was talking about his job and position the whole entire night and annoyed our waiter, my boyfriend and I.  The food is very good, but not anything different than any other Italian restaurants anywhere else.   I would definitely not go here again because of my bad experience, but one experience shouldn't be a deal breaker for this restaurant.  Overall, I would recommend this restaurant for the food and the service, but call in ahead to make sure that they're not holding a reception at the same time.
Three friends and I celebrated my being finished with the MCAT by going here for a balls-to-the-wall dinner. For four people it was about $600, but you don't have to spend nearly that much to have a good time and enjoy a great dinner here. The restaurant itself is classier than its location suggests. The staff is courteous but our waitress had this wannabe-snooty air about her. We started by getting a bottle of red and a bottle of white. The important thing to note here is that the wine list is EXTENSIVE for this restaurant's size -- probably the best in Ithaca. I had a filet of beef and filet of veal duo. Both were cooked perfectly and were really tasty. I heard the pizzas are an equally pleasing - and far less expensive - alternative. My only complaint, a pet peeve of mine, is that the wine glasses are cheap and the wine service was lacking - she poured almost full glasses every time she came around. We then got some dessert menus and each had a Dow's 20 Year port. It was served in some aperitif glasses which made it rather difficult to drink. Our desserts were ginormous; they're made on-site but are really too much for one person to handle after eating dinner. The chocolate cake slice was the biggest I have ever seen. Make reservations FAR IN ADVANCE.
The food was great but the prices were not.  Very pricey, especially for Ithaca.
I went to school in Ithaca for 4 years, and this is my favorite restaurant here! Yes, its pricey but I love the food and the spreads they give you with the bread YUM!!!
I used to come here when it first opened many years ago, and I absolutely loved it.  I moved back to the area and hoped for more of the same.  I was disappointed with both dishes that came our way.  We opted out of dessert because we were already paying so much for so-so food.
Wonderful food wish it had a more picturesque location. It's in Ithaca after all.
The only restaurant I'm positive that would do very well in ultra-competitive NYC.
I'm giving this more of a 4.5 stars, but I'm rounding up. I was really nervous before coming here because, let's face it, Ithaca is not exactly a culinary hotspot.  I was also nervous when we entered the restaurant and the clientele were mostly undergraduates that were out on dates.  It was kind of funny, the guys had a glimmer of hope in their eyes as they were probably thinking that an expensive dinner would help seal the deal with their ladies.  There was definitely a vibe of youthful hope and desperation.  But the real question is, was the food good enough to help these young lads? In short, yes.  They offer a variety of meat, seafood, and vegetarian entrees.  We started off with the calamari.  These squid were HUGE.  Very large for calamari but perfectly cooked.  They also were perched on top of a sweet but spicy sauce.  I believe they called it fra diavolo, but it wasn't really like that at all.  It was more of an asian inspired sauce, rather than a traditional Italian fra diavolo.  But gripes aside, it was delicious. I ordered the ribeye steak.  It too was enormous!  You can expect really large portions here.  But more importantly, it was cooked to the perfect medium rare that I ordered and was incredibly juicy.  The sauce that it came with was slightly sweet and savory and accompanied the meat perfectly. The plantains were also absolutely delicious (and i usually hate those banana imposters). My partner ordered the panko-crusted trout.  Trout can be a difficult fish.  Sometimes it's a little bit more fishy/gamey tasting.  This trout was very mild and very juicy.  It was probably the best trout I have ever tried. My only gripe is that the wine prices are outrageous.  I spend $14 dollars on a glass of wine when the entire bottle retails for $10.  That is just insulting.  For that they get docked 0.5 stars. Other than that, it is clear that they have a professionally trained chef in the kitchen who really knows how to make food.  You won't be disappointed with The Heights!
I have been to the Heights a few times and am always pleased with the food and service.  During lunch, my favorite item is the steak salad. This is literally one of the best salads in the world, and is beyond reasonably priced.  The salad: fresh crispy romaine mix with creamy dressing with vegetables, topped with slices of sirloin steak, pieces of bacon, and fresh cut fries.  Unbelievable, huge, and delicious salad!  They also have wonderful wines by the glass and bottle. They give extremely generous pours by the glass into their large ballooned wine glasses.  Classy place, great ambiance, and the servers are very attentive and professional.
i've been here for dinner once and the food was good, but what i want to write about is my lunch experience. dining at the heights is a pricey though worth the money experience-- but having lunch here instead gives you the same great and attentive service (the waitress checked on us 4-5 times to ask if everything was okay and if we were enjoying our food) and equally delicious and generously portioned food for a fraction of the dinner price.  lunch for two including a coffee only cost $35 before tip. i had the prosciutto wrapped trout which came with an amazing sweet but savory sauce on a bed of (slightly overly salty/creamy) salmon and asparagus risotto. the cheesesteak was okay-- this fancy version with real steak and cheddar just didnt satisfy my taste for an authentic cheesesteak.
This is a really good restaurant with great, accommodating service. Really interesting food options that are delicious. They also have a nice selection of beers. The only reason I didn't give them starts is because their appetizer portions for the price is a little out of whack- e.g. two medium size scallops for $15. Otherwise 4.5 starts and would definitely come back for a special dinner
Ah the heights cafe, nestled in the posh neighborhood of Cayuga Heights. Yes it is expensive, is it worth it.....yes. The food is excellent, everything is fresh and the environment is very serene. If you want to treat your taste buds right in Ithaca the Heights Cafe is the place to go.
Even though I'm giving The Heights four stars, I wouldn't call it the best place to eat in Ithaca. The menu is pricey and the restaurant itself certainly tries to be as upper class as it can be. I was excited to order Hydroponic Greens, just so I could eat something that sounded trendy. Would I suggest The Heights to a tourist? Not unless they were driving up from Palm Beach; there are far too many other Ithaca staple restaurants that I'd urge someone to visit before going here (i.e. Maxie's Supper Club, Glenwood Pines, etc.)
Had dinner here recently when trapped in Ithaca by weather and at a loose end. Absolutely lovely service in a nice space in Community Corners (a tiny strip mall with a Talbots, deli, florist, bakery, ATM, self-service laundry, and this upscale restaurant). The prices are almost city prices, but your entree comes with a salad and the portions are huge. I had a tasty ribeye (a bit overcooked for my definition of rare, but good flavor). Many of the entrees have what are described as elaborate sauces; on my entree, the flavors were well-balanced and perfect with the steak. Other diners seemed equally happy.  The patrons on a Wednesday were a mix of business meals and friends having dinner.
Had a lunch there. The environment is okay as a sit down lunch or even dinner. The foods are well prepared and displayed. Each dish I saw is attractive. Price is not bad either. But the deserts are rough. They are huge, but the flavor are not well matched and blended.  The regular coffee is far from my home brew. If not for the deserts I would give a 4.
This ranks in the top ten meals I've ever had out in my life. Yes its expensive, the location isn't very romantic and if you get put in a booth on the wall you are almost having dinner with your neighbor. All of that being said, the food is positively divine. We went all out, had appetizers and meals and dessert (free if you liked them on Facebook at the time).  Everything was delicious and wonderful. The after dinner chocolate dipped strawberry was a nice touch. The wine list was relatively extensive though it lacked a lot of California wines and we wanted something from home. The wait staff was very polite and attentive, we were well taken care of. Go for the food, be prepared to forgive some of the the logistical issues.
Thinking about this place makes me drool! I ate here about a year ago with my boyfriend for our 2-year anniversary and it was delicious.

The only reason I didn't give them starts is because their appetizer portions for the price is a little out of whack- e.g. two medium size scallops for $15. Otherwise 4.5 starts and would definitely come back for a special dinner
Had dinner here recently when trapped in Ithaca by weather and at a loose end. Absolutely lovely service in a nice space in Community Corners (a tiny strip mall with a Talbots, deli, florist, bakery, ATM, self-service laundry, and this upscale restaurant). The prices are almost city prices, but your entree comes with a salad and the portions are huge. I had a tasty ribeye (a bit overcooked for my definition of rare, but good flavor). Many of the entrees have what are described as elaborate sauces; on my entree, the flavors were well-balanced and perfect with the steak. Other diners seemed equally happy.  The patrons on a Wednesday were a mix of business meals and friends having dinner.
This ranks in the top ten meals I've ever had out in my life. Yes its expensive, the location isn't very romantic and if you get put in a booth on the wall you are almost having dinner with your neighbor. All of that being said, the food is positively divine. We went all out, had appetizers and meals and dessert (free if you liked them on Facebook at the time).  Everything was delicious and wonderful. The after dinner chocolate dipped strawberry was a nice touch. The wine list was relatively extensive though it lacked a lot of California wines and we wanted something from home. The wait staff was very polite and attentive, we were well taken care of. Go for the food, be prepared to forgive some of the the logistical issues.
Perfection. The signature hand cut steak was made even more delicious with a rich, tangy sauce to tie it all together and the signature chocolate cake was the best way to top it all off-- a symphony in my mouth. (The lava cake wasn't bad either.) We tied the whole meal together with a great bordeaux (Chateau Brown). Loved this little spot and will definitely be back next time I'm in Ithaca.
The Heights is one of those Ithaca establishments that everyone goes to at some point during their time here, but my recent trip makes me wonder if that will be the case for much longer. Personally, I find their food extremely delicious but rather over priced for Ithaca. All of their entrees could come down $5 to be more similar to The Antlers. The wine list is great but I've tried several of their cocktails and I can't recommend a single one, much less at their price point. Go to Argos for a decent cocktail. The food is heavy, making it a much better choice for a winter meal. The ambiance is classic, but not fancy and perhaps a bit cramped. In fact, it seems like the price point is more to keep some people out than it is a reflection of what you get. I've had their pizza's (nearly $20 for personal size) and while good I suggest that you ask for any meat to be sliced up. Otherwise, it comes out as large chunks that make it difficult to eat. Coffee was the best part with a nice tray of sweeteners, crystal sugar on a stick, real whip bream, chocolate chips, raw sugar, and probably something else. It's the best deal there!
My wife, daughter, and I went for Mother's Day celebration.  We were welcomed immediately and affectionately by Bobbi.  Our table was ready the moment we arrived. Our cocktails were great!  My dirty vodka martini was spot on! The calamari app was just the perfect crispiness, but not chewy.   Our salads were terrific!  Best caesar I've had in a long while.   For entrees, the t-bone was spectacular!  The skate wing was well prepared, as well. For the finale, we had their lava cake...a whole lot of gooey and chocolatey.   For wine, we had an excellent Meursault.  The Pellegrino marsala paired exceptionally well with dessert. Mark and Bobbi:  Thank you for the fantastic service!
Could not find entrance easily with 3 front doors. Looked closed. We Walked in and left. Dusty glasses and only couple in there at 6:00. Over priced food. $19 for a burger. Menu is trying to be a casual family food & fine dining priced high. There are cheaper fine dining options in the area. Server chased us down trying to offer us "deals" as we left. Embarrassing.
This review is for lunch. I have been several times over the last year. Very good value and really quite nice options. As a plant based eater in Ithaca, I felt the plant based options were thin. Fair veggie dishes, but I always feel a little sad when everything has either meat or dairy (or both). I refuse to alter dishes, especially at a place that crafts its dishes, so I got the fish and wasn't disappointed. Really well cooked and flavored. Having to make a dietary exception means it can't be a go-to restaurant for me personally, but it really is metropolitan area-worthy dining.
One of the best meals of my life, and I have eaten all over nyc. Wonderful service, great wine list and advice on wine to drink with our meal.  Next time in ithaca, we will most definitely be back. Extremely high quality cooking.
This is one of the nicest places to wine and dine in Ithaca. I came here for dinner, all dressed up. It is not cheap, especially for Ithaca, so make sure you've got some spare cash to spend. We had a nice table for our group of 6. The service was impeccable. We started with some wine. There was a guy there who knew all about wines and was let us sample a few before we decided on one. For starters, we had the fried calamari and sicilian cauliflower. The cauliflower was amazing! Its amazing how they made such a plain vegetable so delicious. For my main course, I had the grilled atlantic salmon with tompkins county vegetables (local  vegetables!) and stick rice. It was very very filling! By the time we made it to desert, I was pretty full. I was so full- I don't even remember what I had (or perhaps too drunk to remember). Anyways if you are looking for a nice meal in Ithaca, come here.
I was very excited to try the Heights due to the great Yelp reviews and it didn't disappoint. My friend and I came for lunch after finals to celebrate graduation. So glad that we came for lunch because I've heard that dinner is 2x as much and not very different from lunch at all. I ordered the swordfish, which came on top of arugula and risotto. It was very good, although overly salty and oily. My friend ordered a pasta, which I remember to be good as well. The service was good, but slow toward the end. We waited atleast 10-15 minutes after we finished before someone came to clear our table and give us the bill. However, she made up for it by apologizing and not charging us for a glass of wine. Tip: Come for lunch! I'm not sure if I would give the Heights 4 stars for dinner due to the steep price increase.
Atlantic salmon tasted great, the complimentary salad not so much. Complimentary pita and bread with hummus is a nice difference from bread and butter. Entrees are reasonably sized for the most part, but meat dishes are on the smaller end. Slight complaint is that food took a while to come out but then again we did have 10 people.
Just had an absolutely superb dinner here.  Excellent food, very friendly service and charming ambience.  Unfortunately I live about 250 miles away in Long Island, or I'd become a regular!  But next time I'm in Ithaca, it will be at the top of my list. Great selection on the menu - unfortunately we were only a party of two, so we could not sample more entrees, but we loved the:  Chipotle-Honey Glazed BBQ Atlantic Salmon and the Red Wine Braised Short Ribs.
Have been for both lunch and dinner.  I'm always disappointed by how limited their menu is (I prefer vegetarian), but food is always prepared well.  For dinner: calamari was ok, though didn't really fit the vibe of the restaurant.  Delicious bread and hummus.  Country-style chicken was delicious, though potatoes could have been more substantial.  Their "signature chocolate cake" was a disappointment - tasted like it had been sitting in the refrigerator for two days - but the dessert coffee was very tasty and came with a tray of fun add-ons.   Service was very good.
Its called a Cafe and Grill, but this restaurant is a catering toward fine dining. The Best stuff: the chef is a grad of the culinary institute and knows how to present the food with flare on the plate so it is visually appealing, as well as offer some inspired appetizers. Complimentary sourdough bread offered with balsamic vinegar, hummus or olive spreads. The Good stuff: the menu is chic and varied, with solid offerings in steak and seafood. Most entrees are above average. Some of the seafood dishes are slightly better than The Boatyard. The vegetables are usually very fresh. The deserts are delicious. There are a variety of wines available. The portion sizes are large enough that you will not leave hungry. The Not So Great: The portion sizes may require a box to take home leftovers, especially the steak. The seafood may not be fresh, depending on the day you go, because Ithaca only seems to get fresh seafood once a week. Some dishes are too salty if you are sensitive to that. The pizzas are no better than Ciao!. The steak is not better than a steakhouse. The staff is a little snooty, if you don't order a meal that breaks $100 your waiter may be miffed that he will be making less than $15 off you. The service is often slow when it gets busy.   The Bad: For what you're paying, you are steeply overcharged for the Ithaca area, the quality of the food, the cost of the wine, the service and the atmosphere, however this does keep the college crowd out if you're looking for something a little more elite. The view out the windows is of the parking lot and the road beyond it, but you may not even notice. There is a country-club feel to the dining room, and the decor is unimpressive and blase. Because of the glass windows on the walls, the room feels loud. The seating is cramped, the tables for 4 are crowded together, and if you go in a party of two (such as a date) and get stuck in a booth you feel like you're eating with your neighbors on either side of you with no privacy. The Bottom Line: Very good food(+), great food presentation(++), acceptable service(/), lackluster decor and place setting(-), exorbitant prices(-). 3 Stars.
The Heights is an excellent place for lunch, if you don't mind the country club atmosphere.  The lunch menu is great - a good number of delicious lunch entrees are served in addition to a more standard salad and sandwich menu.  Portions are quite large - but at least you have a chance of finishing your lunch (forget about finishing the dinner portions).  Service is generally quick and attentive - the lunch crowd appears fairly regular and it's a good place for a business meeting. Now, the dinner scene I have mixed feelings about.  I think the menu is rather overpriced - sort of.  It seems perfectly reasonable, if you consider how much you actually are served.  The portions are beyond enourmous, so I can understand that a lot of food can cost a lot of money.  Now, it seems expensive though, when you consider how much you actually want to eat.  I would really rather not pay $40 for an entree, when half of that entree is going to go to waste.  I would gladly pay $30 for a normal sized portion of food.  I realize that a person can take leftovers, but we're not talking about some basic big old bowl of noodles here.  The food is rather carefully prepared, and I can't imagine much of it holding up in a microwave.  It's just not the kind of place that I expect to walk away from with a doggy bag. It also feels overpriced, because the food is not consistenly good.  I have had mediorce meals there, and I have had very good meals there.  I would be more easily willing to pay the prices were I able to fully expect that I would be getting a very good or excellent meal for the cost. Now, the last dinner I had there was definitely one of the best meals I have eaten at the heights.  I ordered an scallop appetizer special, which was fantastic, and then a trout entree special, which was also wonderful.  My husband had the meatball appetizer, and I loved that as well.   It's interesting how this worked out, because my goal in ordering for this particular evening was to ask for the most fragrant menu options available, because the restaurant smelled absolutely horrible.  My husband and I agreed that it was a strange mix of portajohn, perm, and alcohol.  Luckily my plan worked and the stench did not register again until after dessert. The desserts were okay, and have only ever been okay.  I would not go in with high hopes on the dessert front, unless you get the molten chocolate cake.  All molten chocolate cakes are great - that is why every damn restaurants has one. All in all, the Heights is alright.  It's weird to be in a restaurant that seems to cater to both hoity college kids, as well as the country club types.  For now, I'll definitely keep going for lunch, and maybe return for dinner once in a blue moon.
