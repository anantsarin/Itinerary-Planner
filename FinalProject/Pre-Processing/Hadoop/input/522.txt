Syracuse's Premier Day Spa-All the amenities you could ask for; steam showers, saunas, men and women's private locker rooms, aqua terrace, yoga, accupuncture, massage therapy, skin care, nutrition and pure relaxation. I have had multiple great experiences. The staff is the most skilled and professional I have come across in the Syracuse and surrounding area. Prices are very reasonable for all the amenities and level of expertise. They host bridal parties, and special events too-it's a beautiful location. Brand new state of the art facility & a true gem to have in Syracuse. Â Highly recommended!
While I still do not care for the new building they are and have adjusted their prices and I think they are doing well sorting things out to retain clients.
