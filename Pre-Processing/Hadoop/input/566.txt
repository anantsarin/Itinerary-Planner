Fantastic facial, really the best one since I moved here from Los Angeles.  I do hate facials where the facialist leaves the room for 10 or 15 minutes at a time, so I was a little nervous after reading a negative review. But Anita was thoroughly professional, and I got the perfect facial for my very sensitive skin. I will be back!
Rachel is amazing! The best massage therapist in the area. I would highly recommend Terra to anyone.
Rachel is amazing! I highly recommend this spa and Rachel.
This establishment is top notch.  Rachel the owner is very professional but laid back.  They offer lots of therapeutic options to the massage - try the  cupping, it's amazing!
