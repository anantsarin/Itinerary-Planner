Great, been shopping here for more than 10 years, since high school. Now I'm a professional out of college and people still wonder how I dress so well!!! Celine has lots to offer, but mostly if you're very thin. The clothes are of good quality and selection is sporty to very very classy/night dressy. There are no fitting rooms, but they let you exchange only. When I lived close by this wasn't an issue. Now that I am in another state I don't often shop at Celine because I can't easily return items that don't fit.
A $69 Abercrombie & Fitch sweater NEW w/ tags for $10.99 YES, PLEASE!   Being on a budget means exploring every possibility.  The skimpy clothes on the mannequins outside do not appeal to me but the $10.99 signs did.  I walked in while shopping for hot-weather clothes for vacation and have been occasionally going back to see what I find. Everything in the store is $10.99.  They bring new merchandise every week, though keep in mind that most items are not  brand name. No fitting rooms.
