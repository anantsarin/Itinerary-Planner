This is my favourite place to go to breakfast in this town! They make everything to order - they even made us bacon-pancakes when we ordered them one time (that turned into many times) on a whim. Prices are excellent. Portions range from perfect to huge. I rarely finish a pancake, unless it's the only thing I've ordered. Their everything is delicious. Great service, too. Wish they were open all the time!
I found this on a visit back to my hometown.  One word: Pancakes...  you must..  have..  pancakes.  blueberries, chocolate chips, or plain.  amazing.  Thank God there are still places like this in the world.
Working out of town and I did a google search on best breakfast in town. This place is damn good! I crave it while I'm back home. What a throwback 60's diner!
I came here just passin through town. I like the country diner feel. The service was good but the award goes to their home fries with gravy on top. That was incredible. Prices were very reasonable. Defenitly would come back if ever in town. P.S. The hats aren't for sale.
OMG. No, seriously. O.M.G. They serve the best french toast in the entire world here..and I can say this without tasting all of the french toast on the planet. Best part? Its so cheap, you can eat here whenever you get the mad breakfast munchies. They make the food right in front of you and the cooks are all ladies who probably remind you of your mom. It's a nice little restaurant. KEEP IT ALIVE! Bring cash, because they don't accept cards. (And have some french toast for me, would ya?)
Pancakes. Just try their pancakes, and you won't go astray! Blueberry, chocolate or plain. I have ventured off the trusty pancake path and been dissapointed. Nonetheless, I visit pretty frequently. Cheap, quick, and great service!
I am not from the area and when looking for a breakfast place, I found Phil-N-Cindy's. Great place to go for breakfast. They have wonderful pancakes and French toast. The service is great. Prices are very reasonable. I wish I had a place like this near where I live. I will definitely go back when I am in the area again!
Really?  We ordered the omelets.  They were slimey. The toast was waaaay overbuttered and the home fries were soggy.  Not even a fresh fruit garnish on the plate. The atmosphere was ok, very classic diner and the service was pleasant.  I like that they do actually crack real eggs but I would not, I repeat not, go one step out of my way to have breakfast here. You can do better.
Hands down the best place for breakfast, in all of Chautauqua county. Everything I have had, has been delicious. Pancakes bigger than your face (only order one! They are giant!) The best french toast I have ever sank my teeth into. I love the atmosphere too. Like old school diner vibe.. Where you can sit up ad the bar and watch them get to work on your meal. Hats from local companies along the walls. Not to mention how CHEAP it is. :)

There's nothing like getting ready to leave a town to make you appreciative of the places you have especially enjoyed. As someone who moves a lot, eats out too often, and especially appreciates breakfast out, just this morning I made a point to go to Phil and Cindy's Lunch (for breakfast) because I hadn't been there yet. I have to admit that I have avoided it because I dreaded going into a strip mall lunch place that I was sure would be sterile and sad, with the same old white bread sandwich and neglected soup menu as every other diner. But Yelp reviewers mostly gave it five stars, and I decided I had to try it. The most pleasant surprise is the atmosphere inside. The grill is right in front, with a bar at which customers can sit, and watch the goings on, and chat with the servers. The short order cook was stressed with too many orders, and there was a pile of homefried potatoes on the back of the grill, with various egg and pancake orders in the middle. I had a sausage and cheese omelet, which was unfortunately served with American cheese, and which immediately stuck to my teeth. (What's up with that?) I also had a buttered bagel, which was smaller than I like, but my overall experience was made glorious by the home fries, breakfast potatoes that had cooked thoroughly, some of which had gotten crispy brown, and were a taste of the good life and warmer days than Jamestown was having that day (12 degrees at 11 a.m.). Okay, so I wax poetic. It was obvious by the crowd that this is a neighborhood hangout, and a regular one at that. There were specials for under $5, and while sandwiches and soup were on the menu as well, what Phil and Cindy's seemed to specialize in was a sense of community, with the servers chatting up the customers comfortably but not forced, and being overly polite to me, because I had never been there before, and they knew it. This is the kind of local eatery that makes you feel good to be part of the human race, because you can get away from the ugliness of the outside world, and into a place that may not know your name, but knows that what is important is good people, good food, and pride in your neighborhood. Fortunately, I already know there is a place like this in Kodiak, Alaska, where I am moving in two months...
