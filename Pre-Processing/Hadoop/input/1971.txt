Disappointed and underwhelmed. Besides experiencing terrible, slow service, the food was truly mediocre. The manager explained that it is a student-run restaurant, which we knew. The problem is that the prices are quite high (and we are use to NY prices), and do not match the quality of food, preparation or service. I was excited about eating here but will not return. Very disappointed.
This is the only negative review I have ever written. Maybe we caught them on an off day, but this was the most atrociously disappointing meal I have ever had.  The service was non-existent.  The chicken tasted like a pan.  The pasta tasted like nothing.  If they offered me my money back to eat there again, I wouldn't take it.
The restaurant is beautiful. Outside and in. The service was charming. Many of the servers were working front of house for the first-time! So, not top notch and on point, but they were all super kind and thoughtful. Our lunch was pretty good. Great focaccia to start. And the creamy saffron risotto was great, as well. Samesies for the swordfish and roasted veggies. My squid ink pasta needed salt and other flavor impact. But the affogato for dessert was yum, for sure! All in all, it was a very nice dining experience. Definitely recommended for those passing through the area!
Although the quality of the food was excellent, it took two and a half hours to receive our entrees. After about 30 minutes of placing our orders, the waitstaff announced that one of our orders was unavailable, and a sufficient replacement meal was ordered in its place. After two and half hours, three out of four meals were delivered, and the waitstaff announced, upon serving the other guests, that a different fourth meal was unavailable. It was awkward and embarrassing for both the restaurant and my guests, who were traveling from out of town and very much looking forward to their dining experience. The meal was comped, but it does not erase the poor service we received that night.
Italian at its best served by the Culinary Institute of America's students. Like all of the CIA's restaurants Caterina i student run. So every three weeks a new class ends and begins with it new students or "employees which have to be trained. Although mos students pick up everything fairly fast, there is often a learning curve or hiccups along the way especially when it comes to front of the house or service. Yet despite this abnormality Caterina truly delivers some of the finest Italian around as not only are both of the chefs true Italians form Italy but so is the front of the house manager along with the CiA's resources and input. Even if not every single aspect of Caterina is completely Italian, there is no doubt that one will experience genuinely magnificent Italian food and atmosphere while dining. While Caterina;s menu does change regularly the pasta is almost always a guarantee. Not only is the pasta made from scratch in house daily but  so are the sauces and accompaniments From the smell, to the taste to the look it has the homemade feel with out any f the work.  Now they may not always be on the menu bit when they are the squid linguine with spicy shrimp, or the lamb ragu. But of course the ravioli whatever they may be are usually fantastic. Whether on chooses and appetizer and an entree and possibly desert or more traditional way of eating at least in Italy starting with antipasti, then primi piatti typically pasta, then secondi piatti or protein, and contrini and insalata ,sides and salads. Either way can be expensive which is why the prix option is great for saving some on the final bill. Caterina can not only get pricy but fill up fats as it is the only restaurant (not counting Apple Pie) open on Monday. So in addition to Caterina's main dining room there is Al Forno, which does not require a reservation , less expensive,is slightly more casual but equally delicious. Offering options such as neapolitan pizzas, paninis, salads as well as other hot and cold options. One may be set on eating in Caterina but i can assure you that sitting at the bar in Al Forno watching pizza's come to life int the 900-1000 degree oven, while simultaneously the students and MIT create dishes right in front of you. The combination of great food a little conversation and the hustle and bustle of a restaurant is truly on  of the greatest thins in this world. Whether its the main dinging room  or Al Forno no matter what one orders or how much I can guarantee the experience at Caterina is bound to be a good one. A huge thank you and congrats to my fellow classmates, the class of June 13, 2014
Atmosphere:  Beautiful. Calm.  Not too noisy. Service:  Excellent...they really give great service. Food:  We came here for lunch and ordered a small wood-fired pizza, Risotto with saffron and spicy shrimp and Sausage ravioli with sage and bacon.  The food was delicious.  We wanted to order something from each course but those 3 dishes completely filled us up!  We didn't even have dinner that night.  The bread basket that they give at the beginning of the meal is wonderful.  The bread is so fresh and flavorful. We eat A LOT of wood fired pizza so we knew to ask for the bottom to be blackened.  It came to use perfectly cooked.  I ordered the Risotto with spicy shrimp for two reasons:  1 Gordon Ramsay is always making the chefs he works with make risotto and I had never had it before.  2 I love spicy shrimp!  Well, there was absolutely no spice in the dish.  However, after I added ground pepper, it was definitely more flavorful.  It was very good but I was expecting some kick.  The sausage ravioli were perfection. Pricing:  The entire bill came out to $51.  It may sound like a lot since we only had 3 dishes and no drinks but the experience and the flavors really made it well worth the price.  You are not allowed to tip.  But a 17% charge is added to every bill which helps fund student scholarships. We were too stuffed to eat dessert so we ended up walking around the campus and then went to the Apple Pie Bakery...big mistake (see my 1 star rating of the place!).  If I had to do it over again, I would have ordered our dessert to go and then eaten it when we weren't so full.   Even though the food was good, I have to say that I thought the American Bounty Restaurant was FAR FAR FAR superior.  The food here was really good but the food at the American Restaurant was just mind bogglingly delicious.  The flavors were so complex.
Only restaurant open for lunch on Mondays, as @huntingchefnd says "It's a 3.5 star" experience. Our meal as follows: Forget carb-counting, as the basket of  freshly-baked breads and focaccia is replaced throughout the entire meal without asking! Appetizers: Carpaccio di Manzo e Carciofini (Beef Carpaccio with Artichokes, Arugula and Parmesan) - Excellent! One of the best carpaccios I've ever tasted. Wonderfully balanced with the acidity of the marinated baby artichoke cut by the sharpness of parmagiano and the bitterness of the arugula. Pizzetta con Pisella, Ricotta e Pancetta (Pizza with Peas, Ricotta, and Bacon) - Terribly disappointing! This pizza lacked taste and flavor, with the peas being severely dried out by the wood-fired oven. If you are going to try their pizza, order from Al Forno, which has a wide selection of pizzas and paninis. Entrees: Cavatelli allo Zafferano (Saffron Cavatelli with Sausage, Peas, and Pecorino) - So good!!! Per Vincenzo, the heartwarming instructor and maître D, this dish is indeed Southern Italian. The handmade Cavatelli stood up against the sausage and peas with the Pecorino just putting it over the edge. A pinch of red pepper flake could be added, but it's perfect as is. Thank you Vincenzo for making this selection for me! Gnocchi al Ragu di Agnello con Olive (Potato Gnocchi with Lamb Ragu and Olives) - Seeing my indecisiveness, this dish was provided complimentary by the maître D! As cliche as this sounds, the gnocchi were as soft as pillows, literally melting in your mouth. The citrus shavings endearingly enhanced the purity of the lamb. I understand and appreciate the nod to Sicily, but the olives could be omitted, making the Cavatelli dish the overall winner. Both friends ordered the Arrostino di Vitello con Verdurine Primaverili (Roasted Veal with Sage, Rosemary, and Spring Vegetables) - Slightly different from the description, this dish was weighty. The veal was tender, as it should be, matching the fingerling potatoes and carrots. A nicely plated dish too. Dessert: Budino (Chocolate Pudding, Whipped Cream, Sicilian Sea Salt, and Cantucci Biscotti) - Fantastic! I'm a sucker for sea salt desserts these days, and Caterina's nails it! The silky smooth rich Budino makes a lasting impression, easily the best dessert of the group. Tiramisù (Lady Fingers soaked in Espresso and Marscarpone Cream) - Is this what you call heaven? It doesn't look special, but it tastes special. Trust me. Rabarbaro al Biscotto (Rhubarb Cobbler with Vanilla Gelato) - This was like a horse race, with each dessert taking its reign. The warm cobbler was tart yet sweet, yielding coolness from the gelato. I'm not sure how this is Italian, but it's delicious. Wrap-up: All the food is prepared by the students, who are also the wait staff. Our waiter was particularly attentive, had a great sense of humor, and a friendly smile. Vincenzo, the front-of-the-house instructor, is welcoming and charming. The decor reminded me of Italy, as everything inside and outside is FROM Italy. The Murano chandeliers are focal points and particularly eye-catching. And the story behind Caterina de Medici is fascinating. You'll notice the "four forks" tributes, as we can thank her for introducing silverware to fine dining.
I was a bit disappointed with this place, and it seems like other Yelpers were, too.  We stuffed ourselves with the: -different selection of cured meats and veggies (they tasted fresh and there was a variety of 'em) -potato gnocchi (it was ok, but the one at American Bounty is SO delicious!!) -risotto (ok, this was actually my FAVORITE dish of all!!  It was SUPER good, especially when they shred cheese for you on top!!) -braised beef (ok), the polenta and creamed spinach that comes in a super cute, tiny pan are great for looks but were a bit cold in temperature -apple tart for dessert:  unique and interesting, but not necessarily a big fan of as for drinks, the moscato was tasty, and the cocktails were strong. We talked a bit with our server, which was nice.  And even though the food was interesting, it didn't really blow us away.

This review is for the lunch at the Il Forno portion of the restaurant. I've been to the main restaurant for dinner and that clearly deserves 5 stars.   Seating was limited and most of the patrons appeared to be the students of the CIA so I felt like I was at the school cafeteria with conversations flying back and forth.  I was sitting at the bar facing the oven soooo maybe my experience would had been different had I been able to get a table. The setting is beautiful and my pizza was great.  CeeCee the chef making them was very engaging,

The Ristorante Caterina de' Medici is the Italian restaurant at the Culinary Institute of America, one of the premier culinary schools in the U.S. The Tuesday afternoon lunch I had at the Ristorante Caterina de' Medici was one of the best meals I've had in my life. The menu changes regularly, so the dishes I had may not be available at other times, but here's what they were: - Salad: Panzanella (Bread Salad) - light, tangy, and perfect and the presentation was beautiful. - Primi Piatti: Goat Cheese and Summer Squash Risotto - creamy and sweet and salty at once. - Segundi Piatti: Roasted Cornish Game Hen with Root Vegetables - this was actually the least delicious course, but it was still very good. My dining companion got pork medallions with mushrooms and scallions and I was jealous. (The first three courses we paired with an excellent white wine from San Gimignano.) - Dessert: Pear tart and (wonderful) coffee. I didn't think I was very hungry when I went to the restaurant, but I didn't want to pass up the opportunity to have a full, four-course meal. Fortunately, the portions were accomodating and well-spaced (though I did leave very full). As at all the C.I.A. restaurants, all the staff are students at the school. Our waiter was knowledgeable and adorably earnest. The students all do turns in the kitchen, on the floor, and in the Escoffier room. Prices are reasonable for food of this quality. Expect to spent about $50 per person on four courses. The wine prices are very reasonable and the wine selection is excellent. A 15% optional gratuity is included in every bill. This amount goes toward scholarships, uniforms, and other student services. If you want to tip your actual waiter, you must add an additional gratuity. When I went, we ended up leaving a 30% (total) tip. All the C.I.A. restaurants are closed on Sundays and most holidays. Unless you are going for a weekday lunch, reservations are likely to be necessary.
Although the quality of the food was excellent, it took two and a half hours to receive our entrees. After about 30 minutes of placing our orders, the waitstaff announced that one of our orders was unavailable, and a sufficient replacement meal was ordered in its place.

As a cooking enthusiast vacationing near Poughkeepsie, NY, a visit to the Culinary Institute of America was a must.  There are several restaurants on this campus of aspiring top chefs.  Each features students in the kitchen and the dining room, under the supervision and tutelage of their expert professors. I chose Caterina de'Medici for dinner because I wanted to see what they could do with Italian food, one of my favorite cuisines.  I was not disappointed.  The meal started with summer vegetable relish by turns sweet and earthy.  Bread had the crispy crust and soft middle that it should.  My main dish, Trenette al Pesto, was profound in its simplicity with the pesto ingredients (basil, pine nuts, etc.) distinct and identifiable instead of being a mush.  My wife's rabbit dish was distinctive and featured a whitish polenta with an onion or shallot flavor. At the end of the meal, the kitchen gave us a "gift" of a cookie sampler, including some wonderful pistachio cookies.  We followed this with our dessert choices.  My wife's warm chocolate cake with berry sauce oozed molten flavor and heated comfort.  My tartlet with cherries was filled with a smooth custard that was not too heavy, not too light, just right. Throughout the meal, we received wonderful service from our student waiter, who explained each dish and answered each question deftly.  As we left the restaurant, he, his supervisor / instructor and the maitre d'hotel all thanked us for dining with them. In summary, Caterina de'Medici was simply outstanding in a literal sense.  All dishes were prepared well and served with care in a way I've seldom seen.  If you're in the area and love Italian food, you must go.

The quote that accompanies Yelp's five star rating describes my experiences at the Ristorante Caterina de' Medici perfectly: WOOHOO! AS GOOD AS IT GETS! And as someone who personally doesn't care for Italian cuisine, and yet for some reason also spent a few months living in Florence eating authentic Italian food, that's saying quite a bit. Part of the Culinary Institute of America, Ristorante Caterina is the Italian restaurant where students gain hands on experience by rotating through positions within the restaurants. All that means is while your adorable, fresh faced waiter might stumble a little listing the specials, the food is nonetheless exquisite. The chefs utilize fresh, seasonal produce so the menu changes to reflect whatever ingredients are at their peak flavor. I convinced my friends to go out for a final "classes are over, theses are turned in, oh dear god we're graduating soon" dinner, and chose the Ristorante Caterina because I had been there previously (when my family dropped me off at college four years earlier as a wee freshman) and knew it was fantastic, and also because one friend was vegetarian so I knew it would have more friendly dishes for her. The restaurant itself is located within a separate building on the premises whose architecture is reminiscent of a Tuscan villa; the interior is filled with bright, warm colors. Our waitress sat us at the exact same table I sat at four years prior with my family - it was very surreal - and was very friendly and talkative, congratulating us on our impending graduation, answering our questions about the CIA, and taking a picture of us. I immediately ordered us a bottle of prosecco to begin the festivities - the wine list features wines solely from Italy, and thankfully the bottle prices have a reasonable range in price. We decided to share everything, which I recommend because then you get to taste even more of the amazing dishes that come out of the kitchen! We split two appetizers, two large portions of pasta and a fish entree. Arugula salad with fresh onions, baby artichokes and olive dressing: A somewhat small salad, very light with a crisp, refreshing taste. Pecorino cheese flan with crouton and watercress sauce: Initially we weren't going to order it, but boy were we glad we did! Fantastic, and I don't care for cheese that much, but this flan had a nicely light buttery cheesy flavor that was complemented well by the watercress sauce. A must, we couldn't stop oohing and aahing over it. Ravioli filled with green peas, spinach and asparagus: So good, the pasta is freshly made and the filling was mouth-wateringly good. Potato gnocchi with fontina cheese fondue and mushrooms: I'm not much of a fan of gnocchi (or cheese), but this was pretty darn good. My friends couldn't get enough of it themselves, and eagerly ate the entire dish. Steelhead trout grilled with asparagus, radicchio and aged balsamic vinegar: My personal favorite, the trout was grilled to perfection and tasted so fresh and juicy - paired with the balsamic it was even better, and the asparagus and radicchio practically melted in my mouth. The other girls opted to have dessert, which I declined, and they each ordered their own desserts: Crumbly tart filled with ricotta and chocolate Espresso-soaked lady-fingers with mascarpone and orange cream Panna cotta with rhubarb and strawberry compote They passed around tastes to one another and couldn't stop exclaiming over how delicious everything was. The dessert portions are very generous, more so than the other courses although between the four of us we definitely ordered enough food. Presentation was flawless, the food was incredible and we loved the service - they were extraordinarily accommodating, offering to split the check four ways so we could each pay separately, and even though it took them a little while they insisted on doing it for us. We all agreed that this was the perfect way to celebrate our final year coming to an end.
I was a bit disappointed with this place, and it seems like other Yelpers were, too.  We stuffed ourselves with the: -different selection of cured meats and veggies (they tasted fresh and there was a variety of 'em) -potato gnocchi (it was ok, but the one at American Bounty is SO delicious!!) -risotto (ok, this was actually my FAVORITE dish of all!!  It was SUPER good, especially when they shred cheese for you on top!!) -braised beef (ok), the polenta and creamed spinach that comes in a super cute, tiny pan are great for looks but were a bit cold in temperature -apple tart for dessert:  unique and interesting, but not necessarily a big fan of as for drinks, the moscato was tasty, and the cocktails were strong.

I hate to be the person to give this place a low-rating, but unfortunately it seems our experience wasn't as great as everyone else's. I was really excited to come up to CIA to indulge in one of their restaurants to kick off some great eating for my birthday. (it was a trip exchange - my husband got to take his trip to FDR's house nearby, and I got to go to the restaurant) Since my husband is lactose-intolerant, we figured coming here would be a better bet on options for eating. As we're both teachers, I reminded him to keep an open mind that the restaurant would be mostly ran by students and they would be learning within their experience working in the restaurant. But, unfortunately everything in our meal from the drinks to the amuse-bouche and main course were just... falling-flat disappointing. I asked for a midori sour, and dear lord, I've been able to down a few bartenders'-creative-approaches to midori sours before ... but this I actually had to pound the table to get down. It was so bad: too much sour, and he added pineapple juice?? (whaaaat) I actually would have much preferred it if he didn't know how to make one, to just say he couldn't. My husband even went to get a little more soda added to it thinking it would even out the flavor. No, unfortunately it was just bad. The amuse-bouche: white bean crostini. Eh, it was just .. .whatever. To put it lightly, we were all downing the bread at our table with the olive oil whenever we actually received it because the amuse-bouche just wasn't going to cut it. (and our waiter wasn't really attentive as he could have been, as was evidenced to him paying much more attention to the older groups around us and didn't also help that he was kind of just standing talking to his fellow students rather than checking on us as often as he should have.) Appetizers were slightly better than the main course, but still not really anything that I could rave about: the risotto cake was just rice that had taken the form of a cup with a smidge of mozzerella in the center. But the prosciutto was delicious (just wish we'd gotten more than three tiny pieces) But it was the main course that kind of drove the nail in. I was ridiculously excited to get the porchetta-style duck. Needless to say, it was tough, dry, over-seasoned with rosemary, and it was the first time I've left food on my plate because I just found it to be, well, barely edible. Sorry, but I feel that duck is just one of those meats that if you're not gonna serve it tender, don't serve it at all. Which brings me back to the service: I know they're students, but ours as nice as he was, was kind of pitiful: when I asked him to send back the midori sour, he said "oh wow, it's too sour isn't it?" then he'd "be right back" (and no, he never got me a new drink except when I asked for a diet coke which I got 20-minutes after I asked for it. It was my birthday and I was determined to not have a fuss over a drink if our waiter was clearly too frazzled or incompetent at the moment to deal with it.) He also got my husband's order wrong, and seeing him few far and in-between was not really favorable for the high prices we were paying, not knowing what went into the dishes on the menu for the allergy-conscious wasn't exactly comforting, and FORGETTING to get things was just a consistent annoyance. Oh, and he also messed up our final bill and came back 4-times to ask for the amounts we were charging on our cards. The worst of it was, he blamed his "professor for messing with his head." Tiramisu for dessert was the best thing I ate the entire meal next to the bread basket. How does that happen at a CIA restaurant??? Again, tried to have an open mind since they're students, and maybe we came on a bad night. But we walked away from a very expensive bad culinary experience, and disappointed was an understatement. I've been to other culinary school restaurants that somehow manage to get their act together with both food and service. I hope that this place tightens up the screws a little bit because it really has a lot of potential to be much better. (and ps, it was the first time we'd decided to write our feedback on the restaurant "How did we do" card. We filled out the front and back of it :T)

An unforgettable food experience, to say the least!  Visited this location at the end of May so was able to take advantage of the 'Spring Special' that consisted of a three course meal (appetizer, entree, and dessert) plus beverage for only $23.95/per person.   Even though the menu wasn't too extensive, there was still many options to whet your appetite.  Be assured of the highest quality of ingredients in each of these!  Have a question about the ingredients or how something is prepared, just ask the extremely knowledgable yet humble wait staff.  This is where the acadamy really shines... Part of the student's education is to first spend a few weeks in the kitchen making and then the next part is actually serving this delicious food.  So they know what they are talking about! It was also very interesting to get a 'behind the scenes' glimpse into the world of what it takes to be a master chef.  While enjoying your palette pleasing meal, you'll notice students lining up in the background to get the 'ok' from their professor as they are in the midst of taking a test, all the while still keeping a very professional manner.  I now have a renewed appreciation for chef's and those who work in the food industry, that is not an easy job.   I'd recommend visiting this place in the springtime so as to enjoy the special pricing as well as the weather.  The grounds are really breathtaking and contribute to the overall charm of the experience.  As for food recommendations, the portabello pizza was highly satisfying and the Panna Cotta was to die for... picture a cloud melting into a slightly chilled spoon.  The best dessert ever!

Very pleasant experience here. This restaurant is in the campus of CIA, take a look around before you have dinner inside, the view is great. The chandeliers are unique and beautiful. I was told they are gifts to the school from Italy. The waiters are the students and the manager is the professor in CIA. The waiters are very diligent maybe cos their performance will influence the credit for this class. They asked a lot to make sure we feel good, which is so cute. All food appear to be wonderful, even the very plain polenta taste well. They have the BEST prosciutto I've ever had in a restaurant.

My husband and I have been here for dinner for special events, but those meals were prix fixe, so I want to give a review on their al forno section, which is usually open from lunch until dinner and is section of the restaurant that is more casual. We were the only ones dining, so service was great. We had great views(lots of sunlight streaming into the room) of their gardens in the back. I started my meal off with a bellini which had the perfect amount of peach. For our meal my husband ordered the margherita and I had the portabello sandwich which was served with a salad. The margherita was nice and crisp. My sandwich was amazing! I love the combination of goat cheese, hummus, and sun dried tomato. It was served warm and toasty as well(I feel like I should invest in a good pannini press to recreate these dishes). The salad also had a nice house made balsamic dressing. Overall we were really happy with the meal and enjoyed the beautiful atmosphere. This is a good way to try the restaurant if you're on a budget and just want to enjoy an afternoon dining out.

The restaurant itself is located within a separate building on the premises whose architecture is reminiscent of a Tuscan villa; the interior is filled with bright, warm colors. Our waitress sat us at the exact same table I sat at four years prior with my family - it was very surreal - and was very friendly and talkative, congratulating us on our impending graduation, answering our questions about the CIA, and taking a picture of us. I immediately ordered us a bottle of prosecco to begin the festivities - the wine list features wines solely from Italy, and thankfully the bottle prices have a reasonable range in price. We decided to share everything, which I recommend because then you get to taste even more of the amazing dishes that come out of the kitchen! We split two appetizers, two large portions of pasta and a fish entree. Arugula salad with fresh onions, baby artichokes and olive dressing: A somewhat small salad, very light with a crisp, refreshing taste. Pecorino cheese flan with crouton and watercress sauce: Initially we weren't going to order it, but boy were we glad we did! Fantastic, and I don't care for cheese that much, but this flan had a nicely light buttery cheesy flavor that was complemented well by the watercress sauce. A must, we couldn't stop oohing and aahing over it. Ravioli filled with green peas, spinach and asparagus: So good, the pasta is freshly made and the filling was mouth-wateringly good. Potato gnocchi with fontina cheese fondue and mushrooms: I'm not much of a fan of gnocchi (or cheese), but this was pretty darn good. My friends couldn't get enough of it themselves, and eagerly ate the entire dish. Steelhead trout grilled with asparagus, radicchio and aged balsamic vinegar: My personal favorite, the trout was grilled to perfection and tasted so fresh and juicy - paired with the balsamic it was even better, and the asparagus and radicchio practically melted in my mouth. The other girls opted to have dessert, which I declined, and they each ordered their own desserts: Crumbly tart filled with ricotta and chocolate Espresso-soaked lady-fingers with mascarpone and orange cream Panna cotta with rhubarb and strawberry compote They passed around tastes to one another and couldn't stop exclaiming over how delicious everything was. The dessert portions are very generous, more so than the other courses although between the four of us we definitely ordered enough food. Presentation was flawless, the food was incredible and we loved the service - they were extraordinarily accommodating, offering to split the check four ways so we could each pay separately, and even though it took them a little while they insisted on doing it for us. We all agreed that this was the perfect way to celebrate our final year coming to an end.
We came here for lunch on Tuesday at 12:30 PM. We made reservations the day before. We were seated immediately. The student servers try very hard. We ordered the salume plate an appetizer. The prosciutto was yummy. The halibut with zucchini and couscous was fine. The star was the quail. Who knew I would enjoy this so much. It was wrapped in bacon and stuffed. I cannot wait to come back for this lovely dish. I love how the professor walks around and checks in. I told him how much I enjoyed the quail and he said they have it year round. I am so happy we came here. We will return for the quail. My only suggestion is to have the servers/students become more familiar with the menu.. My husband ordered a Peroni and the server had to come back and ask what it was. It was fine with us, but I think the server was embarrassed.
I hate to be the person to give this place a low-rating, but unfortunately it seems our experience wasn't as great as everyone else's. I was really excited to come up to CIA to indulge in one of their restaurants to kick off some great eating for my birthday. (it was a trip exchange - my husband got to take his trip to FDR's house nearby, and I got to go to the restaurant) Since my husband is lactose-intolerant, we figured coming here would be a better bet on options for eating. As we're both teachers, I reminded him to keep an open mind that the restaurant would be mostly ran by students and they would be learning within their experience working in the restaurant. But, unfortunately everything in our meal from the drinks to the amuse-bouche and main course were just... falling-flat disappointing. I asked for a midori sour, and dear lord, I've been able to down a few bartenders'-creative-approaches to midori sours before ... but this I actually had to pound the table to get down. It was so bad: too much sour, and he added pineapple juice?? (whaaaat) I actually would have much preferred it if he didn't know how to make one, to just say he couldn't. My husband even went to get a little more soda added to it thinking it would even out the flavor. No, unfortunately it was just bad. The amuse-bouche: white bean crostini. Eh, it was just .. .whatever. To put it lightly, we were all downing the bread at our table with the olive oil whenever we actually received it because the amuse-bouche just wasn't going to cut it. (and our waiter wasn't really attentive as he could have been, as was evidenced to him paying much more attention to the older groups around us and didn't also help that he was kind of just standing talking to his fellow students rather than checking on us as often as he should have.) Appetizers were slightly better than the main course, but still not really anything that I could rave about: the risotto cake was just rice that had taken the form of a cup with a smidge of mozzerella in the center. But the prosciutto was delicious (just wish we'd gotten more than three tiny pieces) But it was the main course that kind of drove the nail in. I was ridiculously excited to get the porchetta-style duck. Needless to say, it was tough, dry, over-seasoned with rosemary, and it was the first time I've left food on my plate because I just found it to be, well, barely edible. Sorry, but I feel that duck is just one of those meats that if you're not gonna serve it tender, don't serve it at all. Which brings me back to the service: I know they're students, but ours as nice as he was, was kind of pitiful: when I asked him to send back the midori sour, he said "oh wow, it's too sour isn't it?" then he'd "be right back" (and no, he never got me a new drink except when I asked for a diet coke which I got 20-minutes after I asked for it. It was my birthday and I was determined to not have a fuss over a drink if our waiter was clearly too frazzled or incompetent at the moment to deal with it.) He also got my husband's order wrong, and seeing him few far and in-between was not really favorable for the high prices we were paying, not knowing what went into the dishes on the menu for the allergy-conscious wasn't exactly comforting, and FORGETTING to get things was just a consistent annoyance. Oh, and he also messed up our final bill and came back 4-times to ask for the amounts we were charging on our cards. The worst of it was, he blamed his "professor for messing with his head." Tiramisu for dessert was the best thing I ate the entire meal next to the bread basket. How does that happen at a CIA restaurant??? Again, tried to have an open mind since they're students, and maybe we came on a bad night. But we walked away from a very expensive bad culinary experience, and disappointed was an understatement. I've been to other culinary school restaurants that somehow manage to get their act together with both food and service. I hope that this place tightens up the screws a little bit because it really has a lot of potential to be much better. (and ps, it was the first time we'd decided to write our feedback on the restaurant "How did we do" card. We filled out the front and back of it :T)
We took a trip to the Hudson River Valley and couldn't resist visiting the CIA in Hyde Park.  This elite school for chefs is located in the hills just east of the Hudson River, at the site of a former monastery.  They operate 4 student-staffed restaurants and a bakery.  We visited the Medici. We arrived at the sprawling CIA campus on a cold, rainy evening.  We had made our reservations in advance on-line (user friendly, requiring a $10 deposit/person which is deducted from the bill at the end of your meal.) The Medici is housed in a Tuscan style villa.  The dining room had a large, high ceiling, with a huge olive tree in the center.  Archways divided the larger room into separate dining areas, which created a more intimate feel. The service was excellent.  There was a steady stream of student waiters eager to please us.  We were delighted with the basket of homemade bread with carmelized onions.   For an appetizer, we both had the arugula and endive salad with pears, gongonzola cheese, and walnuts.  Delicious.  For an entree, I had the sauteed pork cutlet with sausage, escarole, and bean ragu.  The pork was exceptionally tender.  My wife had the sauteed halibut served with mussels and Sardinian couscous. For dessert, I had the cappuccino creme brulee, with a perfectly crisp coating and creamy custard.  My wife had the espresso laced cheesecake with cherries.   All in all, we had a most excellent and memorable culinary adventure.
An unforgettable food experience, to say the least!  Visited this location at the end of May so was able to take advantage of the 'Spring Special' that consisted of a three course meal (appetizer, entree, and dessert) plus beverage for only $23.95/per person.   Even though the menu wasn't too extensive, there was still many options to whet your appetite.  Be assured of the highest quality of ingredients in each of these!  Have a question about the ingredients or how something is prepared, just ask the extremely knowledgable yet humble wait staff.  This is where the acadamy really shines... Part of the student's education is to first spend a few weeks in the kitchen making and then the next part is actually serving this delicious food.  So they know what they are talking about! It was also very interesting to get a 'behind the scenes' glimpse into the world of what it takes to be a master chef.  While enjoying your palette pleasing meal, you'll notice students lining up in the background to get the 'ok' from their professor as they are in the midst of taking a test, all the while still keeping a very professional manner.  I now have a renewed appreciation for chef's and those who work in the food industry, that is not an easy job.   I'd recommend visiting this place in the springtime so as to enjoy the special pricing as well as the weather.  The grounds are really breathtaking and contribute to the overall charm of the experience.  As for food recommendations, the portabello pizza was highly satisfying and the Panna Cotta was to die for... picture a cloud melting into a slightly chilled spoon.  The best dessert ever!
Service here was a little rough.  The student servers here was just too green for my taste.  Appetizers were good, entrees were ok, and the risotto was just too salty.  The crepe rings were horrible.  The worse thing was no salad cuz they forgot to put it in and the wait on the pasta course.  It was a 4 hour dinner for 4 courses, but our server forgot 2 courses.  No bread either.  Like I said rough.  More training please!!
Very pleasant experience here. This restaurant is in the campus of CIA, take a look around before you have dinner inside, the view is great. The chandeliers are unique and beautiful. I was told they are gifts to the school from Italy. The waiters are the students and the manager is the professor in CIA. The waiters are very diligent maybe cos their performance will influence the credit for this class. They asked a lot to make sure we feel good, which is so cute. All food appear to be wonderful, even the very plain polenta taste well. They have the BEST prosciutto I've ever had in a restaurant.
The exterior of the restaurant is set up like a beautiful Tuscan villa. When you walk inside, towards the maitre d's booth, you pass by an elegant arrangement of pasta accessories that you can buy. After all, this is the Colavita Center of Italian Food and Wine. The restaurant is a definite change of pace from their Escoffier and American Bounty restaurants. The food is pleasant and the presentation beautiful. Filling up on Italian bread and extra virgin olive oil, I had their charcuterie plate for the appetizer, the beef shoulder for the entree and taleggio cheese and mostarda for dessert.They have an excellent cocktail menu and it's worth going there in the warm weather since the sunlight beautifully illuminates the interior.
My husband and I have been here for dinner for special events, but those meals were prix fixe, so I want to give a review on their al forno section, which is usually open from lunch until dinner and is section of the restaurant that is more casual. We were the only ones dining, so service was great. We had great views(lots of sunlight streaming into the room) of their gardens in the back. I started my meal off with a bellini which had the perfect amount of peach. For our meal my husband ordered the margherita and I had the portabello sandwich which was served with a salad. The margherita was nice and crisp. My sandwich was amazing! I love the combination of goat cheese, hummus, and sun dried tomato. It was served warm and toasty as well(I feel like I should invest in a good pannini press to recreate these dishes). The salad also had a nice house made balsamic dressing. Overall we were really happy with the meal and enjoyed the beautiful atmosphere. This is a good way to try the restaurant if you're on a budget and just want to enjoy an afternoon dining out.
I wish that I lived closer. The pizza was so legitimately Italian. The ambiance is kind of cheesy, and the service amateur, but the food makes it worthwhile. The salads and pizza were very satisfying. The paninis looked less so, but I didn't have one.

We went there for Taste of World event hosted by the graduating class. It was a wonderful experience. The meal consisted of appetizers and 4-course meal plus dessert. Each course was paired with wine. The food was wonderful. The live jazz music also greatly enhanced the experience. I highly recommended this!

(04/26/2012)  Since I was nearby, just had to do the tour of the CIA and check out one of their restaurants.  There are 4 restaurants on campus for training (probably in order of difficulty/refinement from lowest to highest, St. Andrew's Cafe, American Bounty, Caterina de' Medici, Escoffier; there's a bakery on campus just for the baking/pastry students).  Students 6 weeks from graduating from the Associates programs do a 3 week rotation in the back of the house and their last 3 weeks prior to graduation in the front of the house.  The student who waited on me for dinner, wanted to continue on to become a master sommelier, he was excellent with his wine pairing suggestions.  He was very nice, a little nervous, set my silverware on the wrong sides (but we fixed it before the instructor came by), answered most of my questions about the food and preparation, and if he didn't know, he went and asked for me.  The restaurant was built to look like an ersatz Tuscan villa, interior was warm, lovely Ventian glass chandeliers.  Colavita basically paid for the whole thing.  Every morning (so to speak, starting at 11:00 pm), the baking/pastry students start classes, their products end up at each of the restaurants on campus; their day ends at 7:00 am.  The bread basked at Caterina had a nice Italian bread with sesame seeds, slightly chewy, even medium-crumb, minimal tang, a rather weak crust (good, but not special), and of course, there was Colavita olive oil on the table for dipping.   They had just switched to the spring menu.  The stuzzi was a crostini with a schmear of black olive tapenade and a dollop of herbed (marjoram or fresh oregano) ricotta and goat cheese; nice mix of salty, creamy, tart, fragrant, but just a bit too much cheese, it overwhelmed the toast and the tapenade.  Antipasti was the Baby Octopus Salad was tender, lovely plating, thick slices of bottarga (salted, fishy, eggy, citrusy, might be an acquired taste), celery was a surprising vegetal flavor, but nice contrasting crunchy, could have used a touch of acid but the olive oil was fruity, baby arugula on the root was a little difficult to eat.  Primi was the Crepe Ring with Ricotta and Swiss Chard; crepes light and ethereal, eggy; filling was creamy, hint of nutmeg, lots of bitter chard; sprinkling of salty Parmeggiano-Reggiano over top and broiled in butter; pleasing, but not necessarily extraordinary.  Secondi was four very fresh, moist mackerel filets (could've used a touch of sear and carmelization on the skin) on a bed of fresh spring peas with cippolini onions on a pool of light tomato sauce (whole thing could've also used a touch of acid, maybe a squirt of lemon to finish).  Chose to do a cheese plate to finish rather than dessert, had a Gorgonzola Piccante (from Lombardy, tangy, pungent, more ripe than the younger Gorgonzola Dolce), Raschera (semi-hard, crumbly, mixture of sheep, cow, and goat's milk cheese from Piedmont,  slightly floral), Ubriaco al Prosecco (prosecco washed-rind, semi-firm, from Veneto, slight acidity in the aroma and rind from the wine, the cheese a touch salty, in a good way).  The accompaniments to the cheese plate, sweet-tart, went will with the platter:  pear-cinnamon and butternut squash (mustard oil imparted a light lavender flavor) conserve, and mostarda di frutta (candied pears? and mustard oil).  Finished the entire meal with an affogato and the dolcetti (anise biscotti, panforte, oatmeal raisin cookie).  While not overwhelmingly spectacular, was a lovely meal.  Wish the best to all the students.

The servers are students of the CIA so they'll treat you like royalty. The food's great. Get your reservations WELL in advance. Also, their take-out pizza bar is worth a try, good stuff!
