Great art supply store near downtown Syracuse. Huge inventory, quality supplies and knowledgable staff. I was more impressed by The Art Store than I was with the Utrecht Art Supply chain in NYC, which has a reputation as being among the best of the best. Steep prices but generally well worth the money.
