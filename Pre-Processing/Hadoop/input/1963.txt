If there's one place I bring friends and family when visiting the area, it is here. Even if you're with folks who can't get around well (we all have aging parents), just a drive up to the upper parking lot to see the lake is worth the $8 per vehicle admission. For the more adventurous, there is hiking, swimming (both for families with lifeguards and "unofficial" swimming holes for a nice cool down during a July hike), mountain biking, trail running, even scuba diving. There are two basic types of terrain, the carriage roads (just what they sound like, gravel/dirt roads that remain here from the grand old resort days early in the 20th century) and hiking trails. Both are easily navigated, not challenging for someone of moderate hiking experience, and pretty well marked. You can cover quite a bit of ground in the park in one visit. These trails are fun, not strenuous. Environments can vary from exposed rock outcroppings to dark, coniferous forest, to wildflower meadows. In summer, enjoy as many wild blueberries and you can eat. If you're coming for the first time, try to park in the upper lot, close to the lake. It's easier to get from place to place from that lot. The namesake lake is a must see, followed by Awosting Falls, a short walk down the hill from the lake. You can take a leisurely hike to Awosting Lake, a couple of miles from Lake Minnewaska, and take side trip to Rainbow Falls on the way. There is also easy access to Sam's Point Preserve and Mohonk Preserve if you want to hook up to trails there. On nice summer weekends, plan to get there early. The lots fill up and they can shut the park once they are at capacity.
I visited Minnewaske State Park on July 4th.  While everyone was at the beach, climbing or barbecuing, I was lucky enough to have the trails all to myself.  About 90 miles away from NYC, this makes for a great Zipcar getaway (180 mi  roundtrip).  I took the Gertrudes Nose trail which is a 8 mile loop around the lake, up to the cliff and back on the other side of the lake.  Give yourself 5 hours for the roundtrip hike and a lunch break at the peak.   The trail is well marked, wide, and with varying terrain.  The area around the lake is an easy gravel road, there are some steep climbs as you move further in, rock hopping across creeks, hopping across large cracks in the ground, and avoiding a lot of overgrown bush.  It kept me pretty busy!  I saw a lot of wild flowers along the trail, even came across a natural "Ice Cave"  that was blasting freezer temp air from the ground... VERY COOL and unexpected to say the least.  I highly recommend this trail but try to bring at least 3 liters of water if you plan to do this hike in the summer.

One of my favorite past time is to get away from the city once in a while and go hiking with close friends.  It's something that I do a few times a year and have been constant in my life for the last 6-7 years.  Over the years I've hiked through more than a few state parks and have always enjoyed the challenge and serenity that these little excursions brings into my life.  They were all great experiences. As far as this park goes, it has pretty much a little bit of everything.  You could mountain bike, ride a horse, swim in a lake, enjoy a picnic, or just hike.  The trails here are very beginner friendly.  Even the harder ones are manageable for newbies with a little effort .  I found the trail enjoyable but a bit on the easy side so for experienced hikers that enjoys harder challenges, I would suggest they go to the other state parks nearby instead.  Rating 5 as the hardest for hiking,  I would rate the trails that are available here anywhere from  a 1 to a 3 depending on the trail chosen. Hikers that just want to enjoy a leisurely stroll through nature would enjoy the flat paved trails that goes around the forest. For those that wants to enjoy hiking as it's meant to be, there are the off road trails that goes into, through, and even over the forest.  These are much funner (but also much more challenging) by forcing you to follow painted color dots that  leads you through dense foliage, rocks, streams, and up and down mountain sides.   All of this effort will be rewarded when you reach one of the many summits among the mountains and you see the majestic view below you.  It'll take your breath away.  It's even better when you watch the sunset from these vantage points. Words could only express so much so I'll let some of the photos do the rest of the talking for me. **************************************************­****************** Avoid this place during damp and or rainy weather weeks if you can.  Seems to bring out the flying bugs in the area.  Although harmless, they are annoying.

*This is not a review about the park, but it's a personal experience.* This girly here grew up and was raised in New York and I am not really in touch with nature. The closest thing to nature that I've been in touch with is Central Park. And well except this trip I had when I was 11 and camped in a cabin in the Catskills and learned about saving the environment and such. But yesterday, was my very first time hiking. Honestly, I didn't know what to expect when we first arrived at the hiking ground. I thought it was a lot of pebbled and soiled trails and walking through a forest, something similar to Central Park but more enhanced. But dang was I wrong. I didn't know rock climbing was involved. I mean definitely not rock climbing on the side of a mountain like what I had seen people do in movies. But there were climbing involved and I thought that I was not prepare for it because I know I have weak arm strength. But pushing myself to do it and taking my time, I was able to do it. After crossing a lake, going up and down rocks, walking through shrubs and bushes and then reaching the summit was an amazing feeling. I felt accomplished each time I get to the top and look out at the beautiful view and taking a deep breath. I am very grateful that the people I went hiking with are one of the most awesome people that I already knew prior to this hike and have just met yesterday. They were very supportive, encouraging and helpful because after all it is my first time hiking. Thank you! Thank you for waiting for me and making sure I am okay, especially every time I squealed and scream from a little slip here and there and of course bugs. After a battle with the bugs that won't leave me alone, climbing that I didn't expect, stepping in a muddy puddle, about 8 miles and 5 cuts/scratches later - my first hike was completed. I had a lot of fun and enjoyed it, well except the bugs that I'm not too crazy about and the climbing that I wasn't used to. But overall, I enjoyed it and will definitely go on another hike in the future.

As a recent aficionado of all things hiking, when debating where to go on my next adventure in the woods, my friend suggested I check out this state park. She also suggested I try Breakneck Ridge Trail. I think gamboling around a tranquil lake and up serene cliffs appeal to me more so than breaking my neck on some ridge trail. And gambol* we did down quiet paths, along side mossy overhangs, to the edge of beautiful cliffs and down to the lakes edge where we rested our feet in the cool, clear waters. I wanted to jump in, but I guess I'll have to do that another time. Skinny dipping in broad daylight in front of random bike riders and other wandering hikers does not really appeal to me. Next time - swimsuit! One of the highlights of the trek was the presence of wild blueberries along the path and cliffs. There is nothing like eating fruit off a vine, bush, tree etc. Something about the wild in it makes it taste so much better. It was mentioned to me that snakes like to gambol around these here parts as well. My friend was keen to catch sight of one. I was not. So while he left a little disappointed not to have come across a "beautiful" rattlesnake, I was happy not to have to run away screaming from one. Minnewaska Lake Preserve is a beautiful park only 1  1/2 to 2 hours outside of the hustle and bustle of NYC and well worth the drive up. So when you get the hankering for a trip away from stress and strife - come here. You will not regret it. *gambol is my new favorite word.
I love it!! Beautiful year round and nice for low-key hiking.

Just like Mohonk I can only say good things. Even though I did get lost and probably wandered into Mohonk territory by the time a park ranger rescued me, I'm still giving it 5 big ones (stars).
