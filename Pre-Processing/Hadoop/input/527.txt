Coming from a big city with stylish gyms to Syracuse can be a big disappointment.   You're not going to find anything with towel service, DJs, celebrity trainers, or a hot young clientele.   But you can still get a good workout in a good environment.  After being grossed out by the Gold's in Liverpool, and a smaller local athletic club, I decided to give PF a try. The gym was VERY clean and well-maintained.  All the equipment was in good working order, and the price is exceedingly reasonable. PF does lack in some things besides the "fancy" touches I'd become accustomed to (and, for $10 a month, I don't miss too much) - mainly free-weights.  Almost all of the weight-training is limited to machines.  They do have multiples of almost every machine, but I know some people don't find them to be sufficient.    They also don't have any bosu or ab balls for stretching, balance, and isometric exercises.  The showers are pretty small, limited, and don't always drain terribly well -- wear sandals. But again -- how much can I complain?  It was $10/month, everything works, it's clean, and it's open 24 hours!  That's better than I can say for any other place I saw in the Syracuse area. Okay, I have one more complaint:  Fox News on the TVs?  Really?  Do we ALL have to suffer through that?  Ah well... it *is* upstate...
