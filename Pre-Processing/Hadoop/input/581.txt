Somehow falling under the radar of NYC's Fashion Week, Grand Street Community Arts Center was the location of 2011's Discard Avant Garb runway show. GSCA is a former neighborhood church, now rather run down but spectacular in a pleasantly gritty way. Discard Avant Garb is a more or less annual low-rent charity event that should not be missed. Local trashionistas strut the runway wearing clothing made entirely of detritus. DJs spin from the choir box, the altar is garishly neon lit and the cash bar lubricates an already receptive audience packed with local hipsters, community activists and social gadflys (surprisingly devoid of Yelpettes, though). The show teeters a fine line between salacious and hilarious, and is an utterly brilliant slapstick parody of consumer culture. Some photos from the 2009 event: flickr.com/photos/thehidâ€¦
Eh, it's a good thing they do, but they made my summer utter shit. The supervisor for the youth organics was a new wave hippie that thought she knew all. I worked out in the sun and for paid $5/hour. Not fun. They took the kids to a farm the last week, and the supervisor let them kill a chicken. Not cool with me. If i get assigned there again next summer, I would rather not have the money. I will never work for them again. As for the other parts of the program, I have no clue. Take Robert's word. He knows his shit. My experience was negative, but youth organics isn't the only part of GSCA, so the rest is beyond my experience.
