We come here often, great casual spot right near the walkway over the Hudson. Same owner as Crave who is so nice and a culinary superstar in our area - very talented chef. They just redid the space inside and the decor is cosy and rustic. Menu is soup, salads, wraps, panini and daily specials. Choice of about 5 sides, which I love. We enjoyed our sandwiches. I had a cider brined pork panini with pesto pasta side and hubs had ahi tuna wrap with spicy sesame noodle side. All fresh and tasty- only minor complaint was my pork was a tad dry and hubs tuna just a shade overcooked, but nothing that kept us from devouring our lunch!
I stopped here last weekend after walking across the Walkway Bridge.  It wasn't too busy.  There were one or two other tables of people there during our meal, but we definitely had no problem finding a seat.  We did go later in the afternoon however, around 3pm on Saturday. My boyfriend got the Lola's burger, which was really good, made with real meat and cooked to the right temperature.  Fries were good too. I got a salad which I believe was a special that day.  It was greens, grilled chicken, blue cheese, sugared walnuts, poached pears, and champagne vinaigrette.  It was really good. I got a side of the peanut noodles as well, which were good but not super spicy unfortunately. Ordered at the counter, food was fresh and arrived quickly, staff was friendly, we enjoyed everything and it was reasonably priced.  I'd definitely go back.
We wanted to walk the walkway over the hudson, so we search for some good food at a good price close to the walkway.  We found Lola's Cafe and the were very happy we chose the place.  We ordered two sandwiches with sides and all was very good. Good vegetables in the sandwich and fish was also good.  The whole combination went well together.
Yowza that was yummy.  Had the Asian noodles.  Felt like I had gone to heaven.  We stopped in after a bike ride across the bridge and on the Dutchess bike trail so I was hungry but would have eaten it even if it was my sixth meal of the day.  Can't wait to find an occasion to go back.
Stopped in to get some lunch to go. The beet and carrot salad was a very generous portion and the chicken along with the rest of the salad was delicious and filling! Can't wait to go again!
First and foremost, I must say the food was AMAZING-to be fair. Unfortunately, I received some of the worst service/treatment in my entire life here. My family was visiting from Brazil and we took them to the Walkway Over The Hudson. Before starting, I wanted to get some food because I was starving and had not eaten breakfast. The four of us walked in and by the time we made our way to the register, two employees behind the counter were whisering to each other and looking at us. I thought this was very strange. I turned around to ask my family if they wanted anything (and they began whispering to each other again) and as soon as I turned to face the register again, they stopped. The woman who took my order did not even greet me. I'm not sure how I offended her so much by walking into the place. I asked her how she was and got no reply. She took my order, I said " thank you very much," and again she did not reply. By this time, my family had already left because they were so offended by the awkwardness of the situation. I paid for my sandwich and sat down to wait for it. When it came up, a young man (not involved in the whispering situation) called my name and I went up to grab it. Their only saving grace is that at least HE had some MANNERS. He thanked me and wished me a good day. The sandwich was absolutely delicious, I will not lie. Maybe I am reading into this situation too much, perhaps it was a "coincidence," BUT- it was awful and stuck with me. Maybe this is their first time owning a place the service industry and they are not yet aware that it is called the SERVICE industry for a REASON.  I have worked in the industry for over 14 years now and cannot ever imagine treating a guest this way. Maybe they thought "oh great-foreigners who are gonna ask to use our bathroom. Tell them we don't have one!" But even if that was the case-the juvenile display of whispering should have never taken place-no matter what it was over. If you want to talk about a guest, at least have the decency to go in the kitchen where they can't see or hear you. Even if they were not discussing us, it still appeared that way and by no means made us feel welcome and certainly will not make us want to return. Whether intentional or not-you also made us feel discriminated against. It was catty, rude, and extremely unprofessional and to make it worse, the parties involved were older people-not teenagers that one would expect this behavior from. Next time, take a moment to think about how your actions can be perceived to a guest and how it can affect your business. It truly is a shame because the food was excellent and the place is just darling, but they have quite a bit to learn about service, manners/etiquette. If they can work on that, I feel this place would be fantastic overall.
The grilled cheese with short ribs is tear worthy.
I have had Lola's cater several lunches for me including the one they catered today and all I have to say is BRAVO!!  Their sandwich/Panini , salad, drinks, and dessert package is a 10 for the quality and price. I will be using Lola's for a long time to come!
Wow!! We were coming through and just stopped to eat here. We had fantastic soups, sandwiches and artichoke chicken with Quinois. They also had gluten free. They need six stars!!
Extremely friendly workers and delicious food! I order something different on the menu almost every time and I am never disappointed.
Great food and the kids who were working there worked hard to provide great customer service! Awesome place to fill up before going to the Walkway Over the Hudson.
Great lunch place with good food.  Service is excellent. Just wished the portions were bigger.
Lola's did an outstanding job catering our wedding.  Having already come highly recommended it didn't take much for us to choose Lola's for our special occasion.  Owner and Chef Ed Kowalski's eye for detail and culinary flavor just confirmed why we chose them.  Our guests are still raving about the food and are looking forward to trying more of his dishes at his restaurant, Crave.  As for our wedding planner, Annalise Puckette, she also did an amazing job.  From the very beginning we knew that we had nothing to worry about.  From food to table settings, Annalise made sure everything was handled with the utmost expertise.  We cannot thank them enough for making our wedding even more special.  As for a recommendation, I would HIGHLY recommend Lola's for any catering event.  You will certainly not be disappointed!!!!!!
I stopped by Lola's for lunch with a friend this past Saturday and was pleasantly surprised.  It's a cute, little place with a pretty expansive menu of very reasonably priced soups, salads, sandwiches, panini, and the like.  There aren't very many vegetarian-friendly options though (by my count, there were only two out of the twenty-four regular menu items) so I opted for two of the side salads.  Both sides were delicious and generously portioned.  My friend, an omnivore, loved her eggplant panini with Prosciutto di Parma and swears she will be back to try more of their enticing options. Some other notes: we did experience a tiny service mishap (part of our order was mixed up with another table's order) but the staff was very apologetic.  More generally, we found the service to be extremely friendly and efficient.  Also, since it's a smallish place, seating is a bit limited and it can get busy during the prime lunch hours.  Luckily, this fare is highly conducive to takeout and the walkway is but a few steps away so why not enjoy your sandwich while taking in the scenic views of the Hudson?
By far the best lunch place around! Their food is always delicious. I love the Ahi pita and the Chipolte Turkey Panini but I have liked every single thing I have tried. It is always packed so you might want to get take out but  it is worth it!
My friend had the Classic Philly Cheesesteak, Oatmeal Cranberry Cookie and two sodas.  She loved it!  Had Buffalo Chicken Salad, two Diet Orange Kist sodas and Cherry Swirl Cheesecake. There is a large selection of diet sodas. Because the place is so popular, best to find your seat, then go up front and pay for your meal and beverage.  Cold beverages and desserts are self-serve. Found the food delicious, generous portions and service excellent.  Employees and patrons had cheerful, upbeat attitudes.  Restroom is small but very clean.  Parking is in the rear and is hard to see from the street.  We parked at the public swimming pool.  Saw two police officers eating there and lots of students.  When you see those two groups you know the price is right and the food is plentiful. Understand the chef is CIA-trained, and the food tastes like it.  We'll be back!
I have been here once for lunch and attended an event catered by this business.  The atmosphere is casual and could use some TLC-- the layout is strange and the decor doesn't cohere and is in need of an upgrade.  Moreover, the food is a major disappointment.  It is basically a minor step up from deli food (mediocre, unremarkable deli food).
Pretty straight forward food, good portions, & good price to quality ratio.  I had the tilapia sandwich with the black bean & corn side, portion was nice, nice whole pieces of fish, price was good. The gf had the black bean burger with the thai noodles & it looked like it was pretty yum as well.  Not a bad lunch spot in Pougkeepsie.  No beer or wine though, boohoo.  Would do again.
We were visiting Poughkeepsie, and a friend recommended Lola's to us.  It was seriously one of the best lunches I've ever had.  We each got a wrap and split them (the red fox wrap and the thai chicken wrap), and they were both incredible.  Even our sides (the salad and the pesto pasta salad) were wonderful.  The food was fresh, filling, and delicious.  The prices were reasonable.  The guy working behind the counter was friendly and worked quickly.  The cafe is very cute and comfortable inside.  We will DEFINITELY be coming back to Lola's whenever we're in the area again.  My only complaint about Lola's is that it's so far from my home!
In Poughkeepsie, seeing a restaurant with the word "gourmet" anywhere on its signboard can make a person wonder, but at Lola's Cafe it is actually true. The food here is yummy, 3.5 stars with a lean more towards 4. My usual order: Coffee and a pastry: in the morning time I would always enjoy to get a coffee and a pastry, sit down and relax a bit before heading off to class. The coffee is ehh, nothing special, but their pastries on the other hand are amazing (then again what else can you expect from a CIA alum...woot-woot, represent!). Portebello Paninni: this is usually one of the menu items that I order when testing a restaurant's worthiness and Lola's Cafe gets an A++++, this sandwich is delicious. Any of the sides are pleasant (you can buy in bulk to take home with you) and the cupcakes are delightful. Negatives: 1) It is not always possible to find a close parking spot (park on Orchard Pl if there is no front street parking), 2) I sometimes had to wait an unusual amount of time in the morning before receiving my order (not really at lunch though), and 3) there are absolutely no discounts given. One time I tried to negotiate a small discount after ordering over a dozen cupcakes and...nope. There aren't any CIA student/alum discounts either, boo. Local places like Lola's usually lend to some sort of discounts especially to customers who come in often, which at the time I was. Oh well.
Great place for lunch, food is great, is a busy place but the staff is organized and they move quickly.
Loved this place! Came here with my 3 kids on a day trip to Mohonk. We all had paninis or a sandwich and they were fabulous: Tomato Mozzarella Avocado Panini; Chipotle Turkey Panini; Grilled Chicken Bruschetta; and the Tilapia Sandwich. The sides--the black beans and corn, and the spicy sesame noodles, were also great. A gourmet but unpretentiously so experience, very friendly, and obviously popular with the locals.
We stopped in for a late lunch (8/14/12) after a walk across the Hudson. We actually parked at the Walkway Across the Hudson lot and then noticed Lola's as we walked above. There is a stairway allowing for easy access from the bridge to the street below. Upon entering and sitting down we were greeted with warm and friendly smiles, along with a quick explanation of how things work. We were probably, clearly from out of town. :-)  The menu offers plenty of variety with salads, wraps, soup and a couple of daily specials. Our daughter had chicken fingers with a tomato/cuke side salad, my wife had the Southwestern Cobb Salad and I the Chicken Waldorf Salad. Drinks are mainly self serve, again with plenty of variety. Everything was fresh and cooked or prepared perfectly. Overall the cafe looked very clean, and the staff seemed more than competent. If we are in the area again we will try to return.
Lola's is my idea of an ideal lunch spot.   I used to live around the corner from Lola's, right when they first opened up.  It was probably the best thing that apartment had going for it. Give me their amazing marinated portabello mushroom sandwich with a side order of fries and let me sit in the front window seat and you will not find me happier. I've probably eaten at Lola's close to 30 times over the past couple years (I still make a point of it to visit whenever I'm in town) and while I get the portabello sandwich 90% of the time, pretty much every single thing I've ever had here has been great to utterly fantastic.   You will not go wrong here.  I recently took the girlfriend to Lola's, after talking about it and building it up to her for over a year.  She was ready to be disappointed, sure I had oversold the place.  One bite of her tacos, and of my portobello sandwich, and she was singing Lola's praises louder than I. I love this place.
Great gourmet cafe. A nice, clean contemporary place to grab lunch. Small, though- limited seating.  I've had to walk out at times or get my lunch to go.  Prices can be a little steep, but the food is really great and the staff are pretty nice overall.   Home-made desserts are mouth-watering and to die for!   The area ( which was going really downhill fast) is also dramatically improving, maybe due to the addition of the Walkway over the Hudson as of last year.  A high-end gourmet restaurant opened up next door and the dumpy gas station across the street just got a new, much improved face lift. Lola's is really a nice little cafe to dine at during lunch- if you can get a table/seat!
I went here for lunch and ordered a haddock fish cake sandwich. The fish cake was awesome. It was a dense patty of fish with homemade tartar sauce on top. The sandwich was unwieldy though. The fish cake slid right out when I tried to eat the sndwich. I also love the fries here. They're fried perfectly and they've got flavor. The cafe has a lot of pastries, which I haven't tried yet. But I will.
Friendly service, and friendly clientele. Rather busy during lunch time, but given that the service was fast. Great sandwiches. The portabello mushroom panini was sumptuous, with fresh mozzarella and perfect bread (grilled, but not too crispy). We also had a thai chicken wrap, which was good as well. The side dishes were fine.

A very delightful staff & a great experience every time we go. Their menu has wraps, salads, and panini's too all of which are super fresh and tasty. I really enjoy the atmosphere there, bright and welcoming. They also have daily specials, many of which I have tried and I recommend. Have a light lunch at Lola's then walk it off over the walkway. Will be back as soon as I can!
Loved this place! Came here with my 3 kids on a day trip to Mohonk. We all had paninis or a sandwich and they were fabulous: Tomato Mozzarella Avocado Panini; Chipotle Turkey Panini; Grilled Chicken Bruschetta; and the Tilapia Sandwich. The sides--the black beans and corn, and the spicy sesame noodles, were also great. A gourmet but unpretentiously so experience, very friendly, and obviously popular with the locals.
Thought I would try and old standby today We had lunch at Lola's Café A great place to eat in or take out Excellent food without a doubt I went for the turkey club wrap, loved every bite Perfect for lunch and my appetite My date had the south beach salad that had an interesting mix She enjoyed it immensely a perfect lunch time fix Our guest had the tilapia sandwich on tasty grilled French bread He savored every bite and this is what he said I would never get tired of this every day When in Poughkeepsie try Lola's Cafe

I love this place.
Been here a few times before walking the Walkway.  Good is fresh and delicious & the staff are attentive and helpful.  There are just a few tables, and you order at the counter -so if you want a table & have a party of two order, it's a good idea to have one person sit & the other order.   I was torn about what to order & they let me taste one of the options to help decide (so nice.). I've tried the turkey & Brie panini (flavorful melted brie and hand cut turkey--very fresh), the Power bowl (unusual combination-love it!).  Tried their burgers-juicy & perfectly cooked.  Brownies soft and yum, chocolate chip cookies were fine (a little dry/cakey for me.).  Overall, a delicious experience!!!
Great gourmet cafe. A nice, clean contemporary place to grab lunch. Small, though- limited seating.  I've had to walk out at times or get my lunch to go.  Prices can be a little steep, but the food is really great and the staff are pretty nice overall.   Home-made desserts are mouth-watering and to die for!   The area ( which was going really downhill fast) is also dramatically improving, maybe due to the addition of the Walkway over the Hudson as of last year.  A high-end gourmet restaurant opened up next door and the dumpy gas station across the street just got a new, much improved face lift.

this is a great local spot for lunch. the food is delicious and you can tell the chef takes time to prepare and make your meal perfect. I usually take my mozzarella, avocado panini with a side of spicy peanut noodles to go as this place is usually full of customers (which is a good thing!) Located beneath the Walkway Over the Hudson and next to Crave Restaurant (joint owners of both establishments) it is easy to get to and a short walk from the train station. Highly recommended.
Friendly service, and friendly clientele. Rather busy during lunch time, but given that the service was fast. Great sandwiches. The portabello mushroom panini was sumptuous, with fresh mozzarella and perfect bread (grilled, but not too crispy). We also had a thai chicken wrap, which was good as well.
