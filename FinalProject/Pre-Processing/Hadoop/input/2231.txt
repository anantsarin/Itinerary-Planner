Great steak, cool, if stuffy, atmosphere. My favorite part of this restaurant is that so few Cornell students actually go here.  This was a great place to go with my boyfriend to feel like an adult, and not a college student, for the night.  We avoided during recruiting season, when companies try to impress almost-graduates with meat and wine. Sadly, my boyfriend became a vegetarian, and, like many steakhouses, John Thomas offers one vegetarian dish per night.
Great steaks, great drink menu, and outstanding service. I've been here several times. Though I spent a lot of money, I got what I paid for each time. Their cocktails are well made and the servers are usually pretty good in giving advice to pair drinks with food. Their side dishes typically come family style, so take note. I thought their mashed potatoes were rich, buttery, and delicious. The strength is obviously the steak, and the ones I've had do not disappoint. They have been full and meaty, always prepared the way I asked for. The restaurant claims to age its steaks in some special proprietary way -- I'm not sure if that has any real effect on the finished product, but the finished product is spectacular. We usually finish it all off with a nice port (they have several options). Start to finish, you get what you pay for.
Here for reunion weekend and the restaurant gave us a private area upstairs for our party of approx 20 -- was a very nice touch and made it fun for us all to mingle between our two tables. The steaks/chops were great -- everyone's meal was cooked quite well. I had the veal chop special and it was absolutely divine -- we voted it the meal of the evening. The sides were good, but did not stand on their own. Appetizers varied from usual, to delicious (I got the smoked trout which was great). Service was great, attentive. Wine was well priced and they had a good selection. Great night, great location.
If Yelp allowed 6 stars, this would be the only place I would EVER give it to. If hyperbole was ever acceptable, it's for a review of this place. Just thinking about this place I get excited inside like a school boy on a snow day, yet feel peace as if I'm on the beach with the sand between my toes and warm sun on my face. No matter what I write here, words cannot describe how amazing this restaurant is. I will try to convey this in the language of mere mortals, but nothing I can say will approach the sheer incredibleness (yes, that's a real word) and awesomeosity (not a real word) of this place. Simply put, BEST. RESTAURANT. EVER. You will hear me talk about this place as if it saved my life or cured a disease. For that I apologize in advance. But if steak could cure illness this place aint John Thomas, it's Jonas effing Salk. I wont go into the detail of the decor, as others have accurately described it as a homey cottage or farmhouse feel. Simply put, you feel welcome when you walk in. Especially on a cold Ithaca winter's day, it's like being invited into someone's home with a fire going and a nice warm blanket for you to cuddle up in while they make you the best meal of your life. Many people would balk at the thought that one of the greatest meals you can have in this country is in a small farmhouse in upstate New York. There may be crazy fancy 15 course meals around the world, exploring the edge of every taste bud's tolerance for new and exciting flavors, but none of them can compare to this comforting place that makes your mouth and soul happy in ways you can't imagine. I've been to restaurants around the world, from San Francisco to Barcelona, but the bar is always set at John Thomas. I lived in Ithaca for 6 years, and when I was a freshman in college my aunt and uncle took me here for dinner when they came to visit. I was hooked. I went back at least once a semester throughout the duration of my bachelors and masters degrees, always as a celebration of either a birthday or end of exams. It's the one place that I would treat myself to no matter how broke I was. It's not cheap, but it's worth every penny. The service is always amazing, the steaks are always cooked so perfectly your brain couldn't possible fathom the superhuman methods that must go into cooking them, and their house made steak sauce is so good they sell it by the jar on site. I dream about the Brie en Croute, and live for my next filet or prime rib. I live in California now but am always thinking about the next time I can fly to New York simply for a John Thomas dinner. Last time I was in NYC I made 4 friends drive 4 hours in a cramped rental car just for dinner here. They did not regret it. If I wasn't apprehensive about a cross-country long distance relationship with an inanimate object, I'd marry it. I love you. Until next time....

Owner Mike Kelly has a unique beef aging process: He ages high quality beef 4-6 weeks to acquire exceptional sweetness and tenderness. Most steak houses age beef 1-2 weeks. Each slab of meat begins at 25-pounds and loses 5-pounds due to water evaporation. The final product yields only nine steaks. Originally from Buffalo, NY, Mr. Kelly attended SUNY Binghamton where he acquired his first job in a steak house as a dishwasher. He has owned restaurants for the past 25 years; this is Mr. Kelly's sixth steak house. Delicious steaks, quite pricey; I had a 40 dollar T-Bone steak, though it was oh so yummy.

Fantastic steak and wonderful service, those two things are guaranteed here.  However, if you insist on ordering a side dish of some sort, always pick the fried option.  The other sides/appetizers are simply not very good. Also, apparently you can order half orders of sides since their full orders are enormous.  This is a tip I heard from someone else so don't quote me on that.

Fantastic steaks, service, and atmosphere. TIP: You can buy that John Thomas sauce to go. TIP: If you are a vinophile, be sure to order a nice wine to go with dinner and ask for the Riedel glasses, they will probably bring them anyway. TIP: The mashed potatoes are good, but get some sauteed wild mushrooms to go with that steak! TIP: Dress nice. They may let you in, and they will not say anything, but I wear my best. If your best is shorts, sweats, jeans, flip-flops, or any baseball hat - go to McDonald's, please - you are ruining my dining experience - and I am not sure they will let you in anyway. Top-Notch

It's well known that John Thomas is among the best steakhouses in Ithaca. It never disappoints.

Great steak! Perfect ambiance and location. Comfortable and cozy. Mushrooms were outstanding! Mashed potatoes needed more salt and they should lose the truffle oil. Key lime pie and creme brûlée were the best desserts! They did not skimp on anything! :)

This is a classic, old school steakhouse. They still have the tomato and onion salad and classic sides (creamed spinach, garlic mashed potatoes, etc). They have very high quality beef and age it in house which is nice. It's a good place for people to go as a group because all of the side dishes are meant to be shared. All of the desserts are great and they come out on a cart to be displayed. The wine ist is also fairly extensive for a restaurant in Ithaca. There's nothing special about his place but also nothing wrong with it. If you're looking for a classic meat and potato restaurant, I recommend this place.

I love this place,  They catered my wedding and did a great job. They do one thing,  meat and they do it right.  The wine selection is the best in the area too.

Not impressed. Very pricey! We have been here before but apparently forgot what a ripoff it is. $45 for an average steak? Then on top of that you have to buy a salad and side vegetable. Steak looked a little lonely on the plate and was under seasoned. In a fine restaurant like that I shouldn't have to s&p the steak myself. Lobster bisque was definitely using real lobster which is a plus but lacked flavor again. With a cup of soup, two entrees, one dessert and two glass of wine...$130 seemed a little bit of an ass raping. Save your money and go somewhere else. Nothing special with the food. Service was very good though.

John Thomas is certainly the best steakhouse I've ever been to, and I've yet to find anyone who disagrees. For reasons still unbeknownst to me, this little gem ended up in Ithaca, rather than any other infinitely more profitable market. Why its owners decided to do this will remain inexplicable to me from a financial perspective, but I am not one to complain. This place is worth a trip. JT is set up in an old Victorian house, and while I do not usually focus on ambience as a major factor of my dining experience, I must say that it contributes quite nicely here. The decor of so many steakhouses seems strange to me given the business that they are running...I'm supposed to pay $50 for a piece of meat in a place with bare brick walls and bottles of ketchup on the table?? Here, the decor is traditional, almost stuffy, such that you feel bad if you aren't wearing a jacket and are embarassed if you happen to drop a crumb on the tablecloth. The meat, of course, is the centerpiece. It's all dry aged and trimmed in house, as would be expected. The porterhouse for two is nice, but I'd never order anything other than the filet. It just doesn't get any better than that. Having been to other high-end steakhouses, I thought that steak could only get so good, that after a certain price point it was all the same. I was wrong. They do it better here, much better. Their house steak sauce, by the way, is the perfect compliment, a delicate blend of sweet and spicy and the perfect accompaniment to any cut. In comparison to the entrees, every other portion of the menu is destined to be viewed in a dimmer light, which is not to say that it is not top notch. The kitchen executes flawlessly across the board. Side dishes are served family style, the garlic mashed potatoes and creamed spinach are excellent. Desserts are served formally, from the cart, which is a touch that I always prefer, given that your mental picture of something can be quite different than the chef's. The wine selection is first-rate, as is essential given the nature of the establishment, as is the collection of spirits. Overall, John Thomas is something special, and definitely the best of Ithaca. If you want to impress someone with a traditional, formal meal, there is no other choice. If you are in from far away and get only one meal in Ithaca, this has to be it.

This place got 5 stars partly for the food but partly for all the great memories I've had here. The food is delicious- I always get the filet, medium rare, and it's never been anything other than perfectly cooked and incredible.  Their sides are great also.  I always get garlic mashed potatoes and the fresh sautéed mushroom caps. They used to have the card game, I'm not sure that they do that anymore, but that always made things a little more fun.   I used to come here every year on Valentine's Day and I loved that they brought the check with a rose... the check to the guy and the rose to the girl.  Aside from that, my parents took me here numerous times as well as friends' parents, so I have lots of warm memories here.
Their steak is very good.  You have to order sides separately, just a sidenote.  I do think this place is hyped up too much, though.  It's good steak, but not worthy of all the hype.
If you like good red meat cooked the way you want it, this is the place for you.  Meals are expensive about $100.00 per person but this place is well worth it ... ask to sit in the green room and your dining experience will be complete.
Steak was like butter! Perfectly cooked and tender. Beautiful, classy atmosphere. Excellent service. The best side was the sauteed wild mushrooms, so good! Fried onions and creamed spinach good.  Also, must try the lobster bisque which was delicious with lots of lobster. Nicely paired with the tomato and smoked mozzarella salad. Very nice wine list. Only possible areas of improvement were mashed potatoes (a bit dry) and apple pie (crust is a bit doughy). All-around wonderful dining experience.
Their T-bone is amazing. However, their potato sides do not hold up as well as their wonderful stakes. Came here with a large group and tried almost every side on the menu. Our mash potatoes had the texture of boxed. Our french fries were an over fried cake of potatoes stuck to each other. However, their Brussels sprouts on special made up for a lot of the potato sins as did the very good creamed spinach. If you are not a pure carnivore, stick with the vegie sides and you'll be happier. And if you are a pure carnivore, well, their steaks will have you in heaven anyways.
Their steaks are fantastic.  It is a bit off the beaten track, though.  Definitely a great place for formal business dinners.
Probably the best steak you can get in Ithaca, but also the most expensive. Not as good as a good steak house in a major city, but if you want a good steak and don't want to leave Ithaca this is the best place to do it. Make sure you budget for a taxi or take a DD though because it is a trek from downtown.
Had an awesome Cut of Beef and found the best Red Wine I have ever had. Molly Dooker's The Boxer Shiraz! You pay for your entree and then sides are family style and separate. Its obviously pricey but i agree that you get whay you pay for and the service is fantastic. They make you feel like you are Most important and VIP. The atmosphere is not what i expected. ITs got more of  a country cottage appeal. Overall Its a great place
3.5 stars but must note that now I've experienced more steakhouses, I no longer see them as being great - just good.  The service is probably the best thing about this place - waitstaff is attentive, knowledgeable and fun.  The food however, could use some improvement.  The crab cake I got was relatively bland, as was the ribeye steak.  I prefer it to steaks that are too charred or salty, but at the end of the day, there was just nothing that made the steak special, or memorable.  The price was also ridiculous for being Ithaca, although it's not a bad choice if you have a special occasion and are really hungry for steak.
The waiters are really nice and helpful, and the food & wine were awesome. A bit pricey but definitely worth it.
John Thomas is the gold standard of steakhouses in Ithaca because it's literally the only one in the "steakhouse" category.   Don't get me wrong, it's a nice place.   Particularly nice on a snowy Ithaca night when you are seated in the green room near the fireplace.  On my many visits, the dry-aged steaks, without fail, are delivered hot to table, and perfectly cooked to requested temperature.  The sides are always delicious.  The wine list is appropriate for the food. My only gripe and the reason I'm giving JT 3 stars is that the (formerly great) service has slipped ALOT lately. The service was what made John Thomas superb, regardless of the ridiculous prices.  I LOVE being waited on hand and foot, and they used to do that...not so now. I could forgive one slip-up, but unfortunately on my three recent visits, I've noticed the same lack of attention.  Gone is the "crumb cleaner," the water boy (or girl) is non-existent, and you can expect your waiter to be harried and inexperienced. It makes me long for a real City where you can be served by a true professional waiter/waitress...one who has chosen this as a vocation and takes pride in the work.  And by the way...one who is richly rewarded for that attention in generous tips. I still love the food, but considering the prices and middling service, can't give it more than 3 stars.
Legendary. John Thomas Steak for two is top of the line steak.  Their steaks are flavored the perfection and does not require more than 2 chews before it melts beautifully in your mouth.  Their mash potatoes are also absolutely to die for. Aside for the price, there is nothing bad you can say about this place  ( maybe the slightly solemn mood)
If Metropolitan Grill in Seattle is my Number 1 steakhouse in America, John Thomas is number 1b. Everything is good here, from the service to the food. Every year, my acappella group came here for the senior dinner, and I looked forward to it every year. We sat up in the private dining room and virtually every single need of ours was met by the staff. They recommended wonderful wines to pair with the prime beef, and gave their honest opinions when asked about things on the menu. I live in California so it's difficult for me to get to John Thomas, but everytime I am in the ole I Town, I always make sure to make a visit to John Thomas.
Nothing has changed. I can't chalk it up to nostalgia, because I have fallen in love with this place all anew. My boyfriend took me here for Valentine's Day dinner. We had the jumbo shrimp cocktail, German fried potatoes, cream of spinach, the porterhouse for two (again, only this time we had it cooked medium-medium-rare), a bottle of the Larkmead 2007 Cabernet (so delicious), and NY cheesecake with a fresh raspberry garnish. The food was wonderful, just perfectly cooked, and I am just itching to go back. The service was so friendly and helpful, the ambiance was homey but romantic. This place is great. I can't wait a whole year to go back again... so we'll definitely come back sooner next time!
steak is AWESOME. we had a smoked trout (?) as appetizer and had a sauteed mushroom as side. the mushroom is buttery but good. the desert cheese case was good as far as i can remember. the part i love most is the way the restaurant make me feel -  not a restaurant, but a visit to a decent gentleman. with a table wine, enjoyed the evening.
I dream about this place sometimes. John Thomas is a hidden gem.  Out on Danby Road near Ithaca College, it's not a widely known place unless you have a car and have lived in the area.  On graduation day (from Cornell and Ithaca), however, it gets difficult to get reservations even two weeks in advance. I've tried the filet mignon and rib-eye and not only are the portions enormous (enough for two people or one very large appetite with no other supplements), the meat is cooked to perfection despite its thickness.  I prefer my meat medium and the pink center of the steak was hot without the bloodiness of rarer cuts.  When I ordered the rib-eye, it came with a homemade fruit sauce which was just an amazing touch to an already delectable steak.  Other things I've ordered on the menu were the baked devil crab appetizer which was nondescript.  It came baked into the clam but tasted like something I could've gotten from Wegmans.  I also had the creamed spinach which is exactly as it is named.  If you come here, you're really just coming for the steak. Service was timely and polite.  They have someone who greets you at the door and takes your coat but the dress can be casual (you won't feel out of place).  The decor is very country-esque with images of deers, etc.
Best steak I've had (and I've had a lot).  The entire meal and experience was equal to (if not superior) their counterparts in Manhattan.  They obviously know what they're doing.  Looking forward to going back.
The bottom line here is that this is an excellent steakhouse for Ithaca.  It would be a decent steakhouse in a major metropolitan area, though they would probably need to lower their prices to compete (they don't have any meaningful competition in Ithaca).  The steak can vary slightly from pretty good to excellent, the side dishes (all steaks are served a la carte) are pretty awesome, and the desserts are decent. As a grad student at Cornell, my buddies and I came to JT for a number of significant and not-so-significant events.  By and large, it never really disappointed.   I ordered the bone-in ribeye about 75% of the time and the prime rib the other 25% of the time.  Medium rare, the ribeye was at times fantastic, while at other times it did suffer slightly from being such a thick cut of meat that it was really difficult to cook evenly.  Some parts ended up rare, while others were more medium...but overall a great steak.  The prime rib was never quite as good as the ribeye could be, but it was still a very good steak.  Feel free to order both with confidence. The sides - the german fried potatoes in particular - were all pretty great.  The GF potatoes were so good that we would usually order two or three orders of them for 5 to 7 people.  Mushroom caps are great, and the onion rings are really good onion rings. Desserts are ok - you might be better served saving dessert for Madeline's, but if you must I can recommend the fruit cobbler a la mode which was always satisfying. Overall, if you're craving good steak in a cool, very "Ithaca" environment (converted barn basically), and don't mind paying a pretty penny, JT is the place.  Actually, it's the only place, so we should consider ourselves lucky that it turns out to be pretty good...!
Yes, you get what you pay for, but if you're comparing John Thomas to top NYC steakhouses, in my opinion you get more at John Thomas for the same price. Recently had a great meal: Smoked trout: 4.5 stars Fresh mozzarella and tomatoes: 4.5 stars 40 oz porterhouse for 2, medium rare: 5+ stars (one of the best steaks I've ever had) Pecan pie: 5 stars Service: 5 stars As for drinks, the martini I had and the Pinot noir my fiancé had were both great. Extensive, exhaustive wine list. Overall great experience. Highly recommended.
Besides the price everything was perfect here. The service was excellent. We were passing by this area so we were dressed very casually and the hostess made us feel very comfortable and welcomed. The waiters were very attentive and extremely friendly, polite and professional. The steaks and lamb chops were cooked perfectly. Our favorite side dish was the sauteed wild mushrooms. The mashed potatoes were baked to have a light brown skin and the daily special vegetable was green beans. There was not a separate menu for kids, however the restaurant offered to make pasta with butter and we were able to share some of our side dishes and steak with our youngest.
I can only guess that anyone who gives this place more than two stars has never been to a NYC (or NYC suburbs) steakhouse. We thought it was a mediocre meal. At those prices we expected good steaks, at a minimum.
First off - I live in PA and need to travel to upstate NY for business - Corning, Geneva, etc. I found this place off the roadfood website and drove 45 miles one way to have dinner - Boy was it worth every minute, every mile and every drop of gas! Since then I have been there a second time and they didn't disappoint. I had the Ribeye both times - I can't even begin to tell you what an awesome piece of meat this was - quite literally the best steak I ever had. I also ordered a half order of the half and half - basically fried onions and french fries and the green beans. Pecan pie is a nice finish. I also need to mention if you are an iced tea fan, which I am, it is a must try. No free refills here, but they make their own blend of iced tea that is a mixture of orange spice, lemon and traditional black teas. Yum. Also, The service was spot on and the location beautiful. As an aside - just the steak was $40.  So plan on spending about $90 per person if you plan to eat steak, sides, a glass of wine and dessert.  Worth it!!!
one of the few places for goood meat around ithaca. good for dates and groups
salad...DIRT ON THE LETTUCE???????????  wow.  at least they took it off our bill. mashed potatoes...it was whatever.  was kinda bland with some chunks of garlic.  I DEF could make better mashed at home. wild mushrooms...it was ok.  on the tasty side but super greasy...VERY buttery. filet mignon...I asked for medium-rare: super charred on the outside, med-well, then RARE in the center...REALLY????  john thomas special sauce...it was too sweet for my taste...kinda like a super sweet sweet and sour sauce? creme brulee...ok this was good. it was a nice atmosphere with good service...but i won't be returning. ps...what steakhouse does NOT lay out the napkins on your lap??????????  first time for everything, i guess.
beyond amazing and was not the one footing the bill ;) had lobster, t-bone steak, mashed potatoes, asparagus and killed it with the aHmazing key lime pie! service was en pointe! and lets just say the extra hour in the gym was worth all the cat cookies in the world... @_@
my favorite steakhouse in the country.  porterhouse literally melts in your mouth.
I asked around Ithaca, when visiting Cornell in Aug. 2009 ,on the get your learn on college tour with my daughter, where the best restaurant was. John Thomas House came up more than once. Why are the better places always in old houses? My son checked yelp which I never heard of at the time and I signed up because it was so helpful in finding cool places like this. The staff was great , they will be as unobtrusive as you want or in my case I liked that they went right along with our more, love good restaurants but not to serious want to have fun style. It was worth going there just for the staff. The food was excellent. As good as you could find anywhere. They even threw in a to go jar of their great home made steak sauce. Love the family style side servings. When vacationing my family loves to find local treasures and this is one. Our waiter (tall guy ,wish I could remember his name) gave us the Grand tour of the place and filled us in on the history. They even let me in the kitchen just to check it out. A nice mix of fine dinning and making you feel like family. I think food is better than a Ruth Chris and way more fun and interesting place. My one negative is the portions of meat are huge. [great if that's what you want] I suggest they give a choice of smaller portions for just a little less. I would have gladly paid $28.00 for 1 fillet than $40.00 for two. Could only eat one. The Creme brulee was excellent and a great choice of wines. If am in area again from philly I'd go again. Thanks, from Rochester to Hanover by far the best meal of our trip food and staff.

Only possible areas of improvement were mashed potatoes (a bit dry) and apple pie (crust is a bit doughy). All-around wonderful dining experience.
Their T-bone is amazing. However, their potato sides do not hold up as well as their wonderful stakes. Came here with a large group and tried almost every side on the menu. Our mash potatoes had the texture of boxed. Our french fries were an over fried cake of potatoes stuck to each other. However, their Brussels sprouts on special made up for a lot of the potato sins as did the very good creamed spinach. If you are not a pure carnivore, stick with the vegie sides and you'll be happier. And if you are a pure carnivore, well, their steaks will have you in heaven anyways.
Their steaks are fantastic.  It is a bit off the beaten track, though.  Definitely a great place for formal business dinners.
Probably the best steak you can get in Ithaca, but also the most expensive. Not as good as a good steak house in a major city, but if you want a good steak and don't want to leave Ithaca this is the best place to do it. Make sure you budget for a taxi or take a DD though because it is a trek from downtown.
Had an awesome Cut of Beef and found the best Red Wine I have ever had. Molly Dooker's The Boxer Shiraz! You pay for your entree and then sides are family style and separate. Its obviously pricey but i agree that you get whay you pay for and the service is fantastic. They make you feel like you are Most important and VIP. The atmosphere is not what i expected. ITs got more of  a country cottage appeal. Overall Its a great place
3.5 stars but must note that now I've experienced more steakhouses, I no longer see them as being great - just good.  The service is probably the best thing about this place - waitstaff is attentive, knowledgeable and fun.  The food however, could use some improvement.  The crab cake I got was relatively bland, as was the ribeye steak.  I prefer it to steaks that are too charred or salty, but at the end of the day, there was just nothing that made the steak special, or memorable.  The price was also ridiculous for being Ithaca, although it's not a bad choice if you have a special occasion and are really hungry for steak.
The waiters are really nice and helpful, and the food & wine were awesome. A bit pricey but definitely worth it.
John Thomas is the gold standard of steakhouses in Ithaca because it's literally the only one in the "steakhouse" category.   Don't get me wrong, it's a nice place.   Particularly nice on a snowy Ithaca night when you are seated in the green room near the fireplace.  On my many visits, the dry-aged steaks, without fail, are delivered hot to table, and perfectly cooked to requested temperature.  The sides are always delicious.  The wine list is appropriate for the food. My only gripe and the reason I'm giving JT 3 stars is that the (formerly great) service has slipped ALOT lately. The service was what made John Thomas superb, regardless of the ridiculous prices.  I LOVE being waited on hand and foot, and they used to do that...not so now. I could forgive one slip-up, but unfortunately on my three recent visits, I've noticed the same lack of attention.  Gone is the "crumb cleaner," the water boy (or girl) is non-existent, and you can expect your waiter to be harried and inexperienced. It makes me long for a real City where you can be served by a true professional waiter/waitress...one who has chosen this as a vocation and takes pride in the work.  And by the way...one who is richly rewarded for that attention in generous tips. I still love the food, but considering the prices and middling service, can't give it more than 3 stars.
Legendary. John Thomas Steak for two is top of the line steak.  Their steaks are flavored the perfection and does not require more than 2 chews before it melts beautifully in your mouth.  Their mash potatoes are also absolutely to die for. Aside for the price, there is nothing bad you can say about this place  ( maybe the slightly solemn mood)
If Metropolitan Grill in Seattle is my Number 1 steakhouse in America, John Thomas is number 1b. Everything is good here, from the service to the food. Every year, my acappella group came here for the senior dinner, and I looked forward to it every year. We sat up in the private dining room and virtually every single need of ours was met by the staff. They recommended wonderful wines to pair with the prime beef, and gave their honest opinions when asked about things on the menu. I live in California so it's difficult for me to get to John Thomas, but everytime I am in the ole I Town, I always make sure to make a visit to John Thomas.
Nothing has changed. I can't chalk it up to nostalgia, because I have fallen in love with this place all anew. My boyfriend took me here for Valentine's Day dinner. We had the jumbo shrimp cocktail, German fried potatoes, cream of spinach, the porterhouse for two (again, only this time we had it cooked medium-medium-rare), a bottle of the Larkmead 2007 Cabernet (so delicious), and NY cheesecake with a fresh raspberry garnish. The food was wonderful, just perfectly cooked, and I am just itching to go back. The service was so friendly and helpful, the ambiance was homey but romantic. This place is great. I can't wait a whole year to go back again... so we'll definitely come back sooner next time!
steak is AWESOME. we had a smoked trout (?) as appetizer and had a sauteed mushroom as side. the mushroom is buttery but good. the desert cheese case was good as far as i can remember. the part i love most is the way the restaurant make me feel -  not a restaurant, but a visit to a decent gentleman. with a table wine, enjoyed the evening.
I dream about this place sometimes. John Thomas is a hidden gem.  Out on Danby Road near Ithaca College, it's not a widely known place unless you have a car and have lived in the area.  On graduation day (from Cornell and Ithaca), however, it gets difficult to get reservations even two weeks in advance. I've tried the filet mignon and rib-eye and not only are the portions enormous (enough for two people or one very large appetite with no other supplements), the meat is cooked to perfection despite its thickness.  I prefer my meat medium and the pink center of the steak was hot without the bloodiness of rarer cuts.  When I ordered the rib-eye, it came with a homemade fruit sauce which was just an amazing touch to an already delectable steak.  Other things I've ordered on the menu were the baked devil crab appetizer which was nondescript.  It came baked into the clam but tasted like something I could've gotten from Wegmans.  I also had the creamed spinach which is exactly as it is named.  If you come here, you're really just coming for the steak. Service was timely and polite.  They have someone who greets you at the door and takes your coat but the dress can be casual (you won't feel out of place).  The decor is very country-esque with images of deers, etc.
Best steak I've had (and I've had a lot).  The entire meal and experience was equal to (if not superior) their counterparts in Manhattan.  They obviously know what they're doing.  Looking forward to going back.
The bottom line here is that this is an excellent steakhouse for Ithaca.  It would be a decent steakhouse in a major metropolitan area, though they would probably need to lower their prices to compete (they don't have any meaningful competition in Ithaca).  The steak can vary slightly from pretty good to excellent, the side dishes (all steaks are served a la carte) are pretty awesome, and the desserts are decent. As a grad student at Cornell, my buddies and I came to JT for a number of significant and not-so-significant events.  By and large, it never really disappointed.   I ordered the bone-in ribeye about 75% of the time and the prime rib the other 25% of the time.  Medium rare, the ribeye was at times fantastic, while at other times it did suffer slightly from being such a thick cut of meat that it was really difficult to cook evenly.  Some parts ended up rare, while others were more medium...but overall a great steak.  The prime rib was never quite as good as the ribeye could be, but it was still a very good steak.  Feel free to order both with confidence. The sides - the german fried potatoes in particular - were all pretty great.  The GF potatoes were so good that we would usually order two or three orders of them for 5 to 7 people.  Mushroom caps are great, and the onion rings are really good onion rings. Desserts are ok - you might be better served saving dessert for Madeline's, but if you must I can recommend the fruit cobbler a la mode which was always satisfying. Overall, if you're craving good steak in a cool, very "Ithaca" environment (converted barn basically), and don't mind paying a pretty penny, JT is the place.  Actually, it's the only place, so we should consider ourselves lucky that it turns out to be pretty good...!
Yes, you get what you pay for, but if you're comparing John Thomas to top NYC steakhouses, in my opinion you get more at John Thomas for the same price. Recently had a great meal: Smoked trout: 4.5 stars Fresh mozzarella and tomatoes: 4.5 stars 40 oz porterhouse for 2, medium rare: 5+ stars (one of the best steaks I've ever had) Pecan pie: 5 stars Service: 5 stars As for drinks, the martini I had and the Pinot noir my fiancé had were both great. Extensive, exhaustive wine list. Overall great experience. Highly recommended.
Besides the price everything was perfect here. The service was excellent. We were passing by this area so we were dressed very casually and the hostess made us feel very comfortable and welcomed. The waiters were very attentive and extremely friendly, polite and professional. The steaks and lamb chops were cooked perfectly. Our favorite side dish was the sauteed wild mushrooms. The mashed potatoes were baked to have a light brown skin and the daily special vegetable was green beans. There was not a separate menu for kids, however the restaurant offered to make pasta with butter and we were able to share some of our side dishes and steak with our youngest.
I can only guess that anyone who gives this place more than two stars has never been to a NYC (or NYC suburbs) steakhouse. We thought it was a mediocre meal. At those prices we expected good steaks, at a minimum.
First off - I live in PA and need to travel to upstate NY for business - Corning, Geneva, etc. I found this place off the roadfood website and drove 45 miles one way to have dinner - Boy was it worth every minute, every mile and every drop of gas! Since then I have been there a second time and they didn't disappoint. I had the Ribeye both times - I can't even begin to tell you what an awesome piece of meat this was - quite literally the best steak I ever had. I also ordered a half order of the half and half - basically fried onions and french fries and the green beans. Pecan pie is a nice finish. I also need to mention if you are an iced tea fan, which I am, it is a must try. No free refills here, but they make their own blend of iced tea that is a mixture of orange spice, lemon and traditional black teas. Yum. Also, The service was spot on and the location beautiful. As an aside - just the steak was $40.  So plan on spending about $90 per person if you plan to eat steak, sides, a glass of wine and dessert.  Worth it!!!
one of the few places for goood meat around ithaca. good for dates and groups
salad...DIRT ON THE LETTUCE???????????  wow.  at least they took it off our bill. mashed potatoes...it was whatever.  was kinda bland with some chunks of garlic.  I DEF could make better mashed at home. wild mushrooms...it was ok.  on the tasty side but super greasy...VERY buttery. filet mignon...I asked for medium-rare: super charred on the outside, med-well, then RARE in the center...REALLY????  john thomas special sauce...it was too sweet for my taste...kinda like a super sweet sweet and sour sauce? creme brulee...ok this was good. it was a nice atmosphere with good service...but i won't be returning. ps...what steakhouse does NOT lay out the napkins on your lap??????????  first time for everything, i guess.
beyond amazing and was not the one footing the bill ;) had lobster, t-bone steak, mashed potatoes, asparagus and killed it with the aHmazing key lime pie! service was en pointe! and lets just say the extra hour in the gym was worth all the cat cookies in the world... @_@
my favorite steakhouse in the country.  porterhouse literally melts in your mouth.
I asked around Ithaca, when visiting Cornell in Aug. 2009 ,on the get your learn on college tour with my daughter, where the best restaurant was. John Thomas House came up more than once. Why are the better places always in old houses? My son checked yelp which I never heard of at the time and I signed up because it was so helpful in finding cool places like this. The staff was great , they will be as unobtrusive as you want or in my case I liked that they went right along with our more, love good restaurants but not to serious want to have fun style. It was worth going there just for the staff. The food was excellent. As good as you could find anywhere. They even threw in a to go jar of their great home made steak sauce. Love the family style side servings. When vacationing my family loves to find local treasures and this is one. Our waiter (tall guy ,wish I could remember his name) gave us the Grand tour of the place and filled us in on the history. They even let me in the kitchen just to check it out. A nice mix of fine dinning and making you feel like family. I think food is better than a Ruth Chris and way more fun and interesting place. My one negative is the portions of meat are huge. [great if that's what you want] I suggest they give a choice of smaller portions for just a little less. I would have gladly paid $28.00 for 1 fillet than $40.00 for two. Could only eat one. The Creme brulee was excellent and a great choice of wines. If am in area again from philly I'd go again. Thanks, from Rochester to Hanover by far the best meal of our trip food and staff.
Service and kitchen excellent. I came here with my wife as I was looking for a good steakhouse during our vacation. This choice was a good one. The service is decent and experienced. They are friendly, attentive and know their job. That's a great plus. We decided to go for the jumbo shrimp cocktail as a starter. Great food quality and the dip was fantastic. For the main-course we took the 40 oz porterhouse steak with half and half and spinach. The steak was amazing and cooked medium rare to our order. Great quality. Spinach had a good taste but lacked a little bit of salt for my taste. The onion rings and fries were crispy and good in taste. All the time we had the feeling of being the only guest. Water was refilled constantly and we are sure we saw all service staff. For desert we took the creme brûlée and a cup of coffee. The creme was good but the coffee was definitely the best I had in the USA by far. I can only recommend to come here. It is worth the money!

John Thomas represents everything good about the dying breed of old-school  steakhouses.  From the clubhouse decor to the dimly-lit dining room, the restaurant evokes memories of a bygone era, one in which you may have expected Mr. Thomas himself (who may or may not have been real, by the way) to waltz through the wooden doors to join you for some whiskey and good red meat. For those of you who may not be familiar with the area, this place is literally the gold standard when it comes to the Ithaca dining scene.  As a poor college student, I visited the steakhouse a grand total of three times in four years -- once for my birthday, once for a friend's birthday, and once for graduation.  That's it.  So for a while, I wondered whether the legend of the place was clouding my judgment of the food.  Having since become a real working adult, I would still venture to say that John Thomas holds its own against Peter Luger, Del Frisco's, and any other top NYC steakhouse.  It's really that good. The must-try item is the porterhouse-for-two, which comes with an amazing house sauce (I know that's taboo, but trust me, there's a reason they show off their sauce).  Their lobsters, when available, are quite possibly the largest crustaceans I have ever seen in my life.  They are basically mammals.  Sides are ordered a la carte --  I love both the wild mushrooms and the mushroom caps, and you should order a combination of the french-fried onions and potatoes.  Throw in some spinach (creamed or sauteed) and you're good to go!  Once you're about to explode after an evening of gluttony, a server will showcase a cart/tray of homemade desserts.  It's really hard to go wrong, but the cheesecake is superb. I'd be remiss if I ended my review without talking about poker.  Every guest at John Thomas receives a poker card (although now only Monday - Wednesday).  You can mix and match cards with your companions to form poker hands, which are redeemable for a number of different food prizes -- a royal flush, for example, will net you an entree for two!   I learned the other night that some Cornell students began counterfeiting the cards and selling them for a profit on eBay and Craigslist (which is just truly sad).  Apparently, the poker game was halted until about a year ago, after which the restaurant decided to continue it (due to some pissed-off regulars) on a limited basis. Seriously, how can you not love this place??

Came to check out the restaurant for a work dinner. Very friendly knowledgable staff. I LOVE when servers memorize the specials of the day and don't need to read it off their books. Shows they enjoy their job and took the time to remember things. Our server was great! Everything came out in a timely manner and the food was delicious!  I had my doubts....but when my 5lb bone in prime rib came I was thoroughly surprised and pleased with it. Biggest prime rib I've EVER seen!  And it was delicious!  We got sautéed spinach and the wild mushrooms. Both excellent. And then the dessert cart came rolling through.....the flour less chocolate cake was like a piece of solid fudge. So decadent and delicious!   Very surprised and glad that I got to experience such a great dinner there. Can't wait to bring my group there!

Truly the best meal and experience we've ever had at a restaurant. Upstairs bar with good whiskey selection, outstanding and unobtrusive service, and all within walking distance to a lovely spa and resort. The atmosphere is cozy and unpretentious. We went with a classic order, starting with calamari and choosing ribeye and lobster for our main course. Absolutely delicious!!

This place literally has the best lobster ever. I came here for a formal at Cornell during my visit from Berkeley and I was very very impressed with how fresh the seafood was. I ordered the tuna steak which was also delicious and perfectly cooked on the outside, pink on the inside. The calamari was also a great starter and perfectly crisped on the outside but tender on the inside. One thing though, the service wasn't that great. The woman who was serving us refused to let me taste the wine before we ordered the bottle (standard at any nice restaurant) and she also didn't have the best attitude. Dessert was average, I ordered the berry cobbler a la mode, and it tasted like it usually does, despite the waiter's very positive recommendation. The creme brulee was pretty good, it was smooth and creamy and pretty delicious. What I also liked was the fact that they pushed around the options after for us to choose with visuals. I would definitely recommend this place for the seafood (didn't actually try any red meat), although for a full meal be ready to spend quite a bit of money. It worked out to about $100 a person. If I could give 3.5 stars I would, but with the service and the dessert, it trends more towards a 3 star experience.

The service was exceptional!  Very high customer service. We ordered the tomatoes with fresh mozzarella, which was great.  The Mashed potatoes and Brussel sprouts we great.  The porterhouse for two was amazing.  The deserts are all made in house! This is a real steak house, not just a place to get great steak.  (Go to Chillis for that.)   We had our anniversary there and it was a great night!

This restaurant is in a house set back from a main road on the outskirts of Ithaca, with a pond to the side of the property. The tables are spread through the rooms. The hostess greeted us as we walked in and seated us at a quiet table in the front room with views of the pond and the flowers that lined the entrance walkway. You almost feel like you are walking in to a friend's home that is set up for a dinner party. Our servers were fantastic!! Friendly, cheerful and attentive but never overbearing. Once we were seated, water was poured and bread was served. For appetizers, we ordered lump crabmeat cocktail (a special) and smoked mozzarella & tomato salad. Both were incredible. The crab was fresh - not fishy at all- and mixed with a mildly-flavored remoulade that did not overpower the crab. The fresh tomatoes and smoked cheese were sliced thick (a knife was needed) and topped with a really good balsamic vinaigrette. The menu is a la carte- we chose Filet Mignon medallions with a wild mushroom demi-glace, rib-eye steak, asparagus and German fried potatoes. All were delicious - the mushrooms were sliced thin and not overcooked. The medallions were a perfect medium and tender, with just the right amount of demi-glace (which was amazing). The potatoes were awesome- baked potatoes cubed and fried...yum!! We were too full to for dessert but we watched the dessert cart intently whenever it passed our table, lol. Pricey? Yes. Worth it? YES. In this case, we got what we paid for- a fantastically delicious dinner in a romantic setting with outstanding service. It was a pleasant, romantic, relaxed and intimate setting - I honestly cannot think of one even slightly negative thing to say. This was one of the best steak dinners I've ever had, and I wish we lived closer.

Simply put: vastly overrated. I'm no stranger to prime steakhouses (and the hefty price tag that comes with them).  No matter where you are, be it a town like Ithaca or a metro area like NYC, aged prime cuts WILL be expensive.  The problem, however, is when a restaurant executes steaks with Outback-like imprecision, yet still charge prime prices. If you're even considering a place like this, chances are you're going for the steak.  We ordered the Porterhouse for two, specified as rare.  What we got was medium/medium-well, decently charred but obviously finished for waaaay too long in an oven.  Dry, pink bordering on grey, and tough.  For a steakhouse, overcooking a cut is virtually inexcusable.  But what's completely inexcusable?  A waiter refusing to redo the order and gently suggesting that the guests are mistaken.  Incredible. Steak aside (a huge aside), this place is like the vast majority of clubhouse-like steakhouse.  Standard a la carte sides, decent wine list stocked full of notable reds along side obvious stinkers at 5-10 times retail price, and a poorly lit interior that reminds you of something in between a dated country club back room in desperate need of renovation and your great grandfather's living room.  Kitschy and charming for some, massively dated for others. Admittedly, this is Ithaca, where the culinary experience typically tops out at "it's pretty good...for Ithaca!"  With that in mind, John Thomas is pretty much the only game in town.  But from a broader viewpoint?  Skip this place and get a steak whenever you leave town.

This is not great steak, and for $90 for a porterhouse for two, you deserve a great fucking steak.  So I advise you to seek something else when you are in Ithaca. The New York City area luckily and thankfully has Peter Luger's, and it appears that John Thomas is biting their style hardcore, and in the worst way.  I don't know how long JT has been around, but probably not as long.  Their menus are almost identical, but do not compare in quality or worth at all. Sliced Tomatoes and Onions - $8. Tomatoes were not ripe.  They were a pale red, almost white like and hard as hell.  Like,  I had difficulty cutting it with a butter knife.   Petite Porterhouse for Two - $59.  Asked for Medium, received it overcooked and served close to Medium Well all over, and Well Done at the ends.  No one who gives a shit about steak eats it 1. past Medium and 2. FORGET MEDIUM WELL/WELL DONE.  I think if we had ordered the regular Porterhouse, I would have had to send it back because you better bet your ass I am not eating an overcooked $100 steak.  For $60, fine, but I still contemplated it.  The waiter did not come over to ask how it was until we had eaten a few pieces, because we were starving, so we missed our window anyway.  Upon first glance, I knew it was overcooked.  Steak people, beware. The table next to us asked for vegetarian main entrees and also ate their steak with a bottle of A1.  DO I REALLY NEED TO SAY ANYTHING ELSE? Creamed Spinach - $8.  Good, but was not seasoned at all.  I had to use the table salt.  *cringe* Half and Half  (French Fries and Onions) - $8.  Good, but the fries were not seasoned either. Luckily my Tanqueray and tonic was pretty perfect, so that helped soften the blow of this disappointing anniversary dinner.  I need some Peter Luger's now to wash away the memory of this place.
This is not great steak, and for $90 for a porterhouse for two, you deserve a great fucking steak.  So I advise you to seek something else when you are in Ithaca. The New York City area luckily and thankfully has Peter Luger's, and it appears that John Thomas is biting their style hardcore, and in the worst way.  I don't know how long JT has been around, but probably not as long.  Their menus are almost identical, but do not compare in quality or worth at all.

Ah yes, venerable old John Thomas.  Okay, so yeah, most of the guys know that this is the place to take your date and partake in the sensual alchemy of turning red meat and red wine into sex.  But outside of that John Thomas is certainly one of the best steak houses in the United States. This place is very old school, and not in the leather booth, clubby atmosphere that most folks think about when envisioning an old school steak house, but old school in a more period way almost Victorian.  The waiters are famously tall, the side dishes range from baked brie to deviled crab, and the steaks are amazing.   They dry age their own primals out back, and come to you as wonderfully unadorned perfection.  If you want to take a break from the purist meat experience (bone in shell NYs, Rib Eye, or Porterhouse) from time to time they also have tornadoes in Gorgonzola cream sauce which is pretty heavenly as well. They carry a nice selection of wines as well, from both the old country and the new and their sorbets and desserts are well executed.  Just seeing the dessert cart after a full on meat orgy might cause you to put up the white flag, but get dessert anyway!  It'll be worth it.  As if their wares weren't addicting enough, they also play a little game, whereby each diner gets a JT playing card at the end of the meal.  Collect enough to get a decent poker hand, and you can score yourself some tasty treats...well deserved, since you'll probably be broke by the time you've got a full house in your carnivorous little hands.

I wasn't thrilled when my sister decided to go to school in a small town across the country, but I've been quite delighted by Ithaca's dining scene. In fact, I've been blown away by the quality of cheap eats available to the point that I've come to look forward to dining in Ithaca. John Thomas was a complete disappointment and one of the worst expensive meals I've had in a long time. I'd say it's generally a bad sign when I request a cocktail menu, and I'm told to just come up with one because they can make anything. Yes, but what do you make well? Don't you have any unique twists on standard drinks? Still, I tried to have faith. I don't mind paying well for a good glass or bottle of wine, but when I see the cheapest and most mass-produced of California wines on the menu, I am skeptical of everything else on the list. My partner ordered a $15 glass of red and said it was pretty terrible. A few of the food items were ok but there wasn't a single one I would go back for. I ordered the vegetarian dish of the day thinking it's always smart to order a "special," but it turned out to be a giant bowl of very bland pasta with noodles from a box. I did have some steak to make up for that, and it was decent but nothing special. The throwback dessert platter was an embarrassment if you ask me. Fortunately, we ate at Mercato the next evening, and my faith in Ithaca dining was redeemed. John Thomas is clearly past its prime (if it ever had one). I'm a foodie with high standards, but I would rather eat at Applebee's than return.

Best porterhouse and garlic mashed potatoes. I was fortunate to eat at John Thomas' on several occassions and if I ever get to Ithaca again I will definitly be here to eat.   The service here is stellar, the ambiance is romantic, and food just doesn't get any better than here.

This place is incredible.  Everything is spot on. The service is impeccable. The steaks are prime and cooked to perfection. This is a place that takes beef seriously and I really like that. Our waiter did everything right, from offering cocktails before the meal, to serving the wine at the right time, to not rushing us at all, but never letting us go hungry. There isn't really anything I can say that hasn't been said before, but if you enjoy wine and PRIME beef (try finding that at other restaurants in the area), this is the place for you.  Sure, your wallet takes a hit, but it's worth it.

I've eaten at John Thomas so many times that the waiters know my friends and I by name. So I can say with confidence that John Thomas has great steak. I can not deny that; their steak is delicious, and always cooked exactly as requested. This is why I've been there dozens of times; that and it happens to be the dinner destination of choice for many of my friends. However, were it not the only steakhouse in Ithaca, it would not have been my choice. For one, the side dishes leave a lot to be desired. Their mashed potatoes are dryer than the Sahara, any veggie dish is always so buttery or greasy that it is inedible, even the french fries are rather bland. I will say that the fried onions are delicious, and the baked brie appetizer is likely the culprit behind all of my college weight gain. Desserts are not worth bothering, and never, ever change. At one point I could recite them. While the wine list is extensive, it is offensively priced. While my friends often ordered ridiculously expensive bottles, I personally tended to stick to one of about 5 choices. All of these choices, in my first year at Cornell, were priced between $40 and $60. By the time I graduated, these prices had inflated to between $90 and $150 for the same, widely available, well known wines. I understand prices must increase, but it is just offensive to pay $150 for a bottle of widely available wine that would be $30 in a liquor store. Additionally, their food is priced at NYC standards, which is ridiculous considering their remote Ithaca location, and the waiters are often pretentious beyond belief. There are a few amazing, amazing waiters at JTs, who are both great at their job and have a sense of humor. However, if you get one of the guys who takes their job a bit too seriously, it is almost painful to listen to the specials (lobster bisque, crab cocktail, tournedos -- specials really aren't that special when they're offered every day). For a great assortment of beef cuts, or a good lobster, JTs is of course the place to go. Their private room is also the best in Ithaca -- while on the smaller side, it has a private bathroom. The restaurant will always hold a special place in my heart after far too many debaucherous dinners there. But if you are just visiting Ithaca, there are far more interesting restaurants that I would choose over JTs.
OH MY GAWD. Any restaurant in Ithaca does not get much better. Yes, it's not your typical five star restaurant with the chic atmosphere and leather couches, but it's different. The setting is in an old farm house and its just quaint. Like so comfortable, yet a great atmosphere for steak. My friends and I had a porterhouse steak for 2 (we had four people so we had 2 orders of that). The garlic mashed potatoes, the soft tender flank, the perfect marinade and JT's special house sauce... a masterpiece. Go here, if you ever go to Ithaca, you have to go. HAVE TO. Mr. Kelly has really done it, his beef aging process is exceptional. The waiters are very professional and very courteous. They know the food and what they're talking about unlike waiters at some restaurants who just memorize the menu rote. It's expensive, but hey man, it's a steakhouse. If you want to treat yourself, the porterhouse is actually a pretty nice option.

What a crashing disappointment...either that, or I ordered the wrong things which can happen the first time you visit a restaurant. Let's face it, not everything on any menu will be cooked to perfection, so perhaps, it was not my night. On a positive note, the restaurant decor is warm and welcoming. Set inside a large, remodeled farm house, each room is cozy and comfortable. Our room had a fireplace...very nice. The first thing you should know is that dinner is served ala carte...haven't seen this in years...including the "sides." When you ask a guest to pay anywhere from $20 to $40 dollars an entree, throw in some rice or veggies...if anything else, to keep the entree from looking sad and lonely on the plate. I ordered the lamb chops, because they are rarely on most steakhouse menus (should have been a clue) They were plump and moist inside but were....MY PET PEEVE...covered in blackened charcoal from the grill..Yuck. Note to all chefs: when you char the hell out of piece of meat, it leaves a metallic, bitter taste in your mouth that is not only unpleasent, but renders the dish inedible. It was served with a little tub of gelatinous green "mint" sauce that looked and tasted like toothpaste. The hub had the "charred" chicken....with nothing else on the plate...I swear, just a tired looking, blackened chicken breast sitting in the middle of the plate...no garnish, nothing. Not very cheffy. The waitress swished back and forth past our table, rarely checking in...maybe she was embarassed by the dishes we were served too. Everyone around us seemed to be oohing and ahhhing over their dishes...I should have asked them what they had ordered. It is rare that I go back to a restaurant after I have had a lackluster experience, but based on fellow Yelpers comments, I might give it one more try....right now, there is really nothing drawing me back.

This place is a MUST for steak lovers in the Ithaca area. Pricey but worth every penny. I am from Long Island and have eaten at great steakhouses including Morton's, Bryant & Cooper, Prime, & the Palm. This place is truly on par with all of those. My filet was cooked PERFECTLY and was delicious. The appetizers and sides were truly exceptional. The dessert summed up a perfect meal. This place is a favorite of my family's for every time that they visit. It never ceases to amaze.

Nestled underneath the radar of most nearby university students and their Discover Cards, this might be the crown jewel in the Ithaca dining experience. I don't remember when or how I first became aware of this place, but it's now a mandatory stop if I'm in town for more than five hours. AJ's review says it all. Their specialty is beef, dry aged on the premises. One member of my party is from Maryland and is notoriously finicky about her seafood. Fortunately, our (extremely tall) waiter was from Baltimore and swooped in to save us from a mayonnaise-laden crab cake. No problem: the 14 oz filet lived up to its billing, and went well with the creamed spinach and french fried onions. The indulgence continued with an extensive wine list, and a dessert cart with options that make you sad to have to choose. We went with the cranberry cobbler, the key lime pie, and the German chocolate cake, all winners. For those who have never been: great atmosphere (in a two-level victorian attached to La Tourelle Inn) and impeccable service. Alas, the aforementioned playing card game was discontinued in December after some industrious saboteurs sold a mess of them on craigslist, prompting locals to come in with an astounding poker hand and walk out with $100 worth of steak. And me with my king and five of clubs from 2001!   *sigh* Eat here, and tell your friends.

John Thomas is really an amazing restaurant for Ithaca standards. It offers some great steaks, but it is definitely not at the level of the top New York City steakhouses. The porterhouse and the fillet mignon are highly recommended as well as their sides. Appetizers are also very good. Desserts are so and so though :( In terms of the wine list, I have to admit that it is really very nice and extensive but a bit overpriced. Their selection of wines by the glass is very nice though. I was never disappointed with any of them. Finally I have to admit that I really love the environment. The restaurant is in an old-fashioned style house and this  really adds to the whole experience. It is highly recommended for a date as well!

After mailing my final student loan payment to my 'dysfunctional uncle', my then-girlfriend and I celebrated by coming here and partook of a porterhouse carved for two. Simply the best steak I have had in my relatively short life. Classy joint. A.J. and Andy have said it all. I'm sort of happy that they discontinued the poker game. The food is good enough to not need a 'please come back' gimmick - in fact, in my case, the food is so good to require a 'very good reason to celebrate by coming to JT'. It's a special place with special food, without question.

I live in New Orleans (let's be honest; on a per capita basis we have the best restaurants in the world) and travel to Texas a lot on business--that means a lot of top-notch steaks consumed.  John Thomas in Ithaca, NY is one of the best steakhouses I've ever been to.  How messed up is that?  Atmosphere, though, is nothing like Texas...it feels like you are in someone's dining room in a nice Upstate home.  Very welcoming. I visit my alma mater above Cayuga's waters once a year and John Thomas is a destination always on my list.  They do a great job with steaks, all the cuts you could ask for. I really do enjoy their salads and appetizers.  Phenomenal tomato salads (blue cheese and caprese-style), classic seafood appetizer options, good desserts. It's not that they do things no one else does; they do things other restaurants do, just better. Their prices...well, you get what you pay for.

Hands down, best steak I've had in my life. Prime Rib au Jus cooked medium.  Here's what else we ordered: Brie en Croute (I dream about eating this again! Served with a killer raspberry sauce) Fried French Onions (perfection) Mashed Potatoes with Roasted Garlic (good, but skippable) Fresh Sauteed Wild Mushrooms (outstanding!) Creamed Spinach (great when it first came out, then only so/so as it cooled) Veggie of the Day - Maple Squash (never tasted better squash) Creme Brulee (heavenly) Apple Pie a la Mode (not a fan -- crust was bland and the texture was off) Here's what else I love about this place -- you get a top notch meal in a somewhat casual environment. Think warm, cozy German cottage. If you're ever in Ithaca, please do not miss this. I can't wait to do it again.

Yes, it's a great steakhouse.  John Thomas will cook your steak correctly and has all the basic cuts of meats that you would hope for.  Other than that, I don't know what all of the fuss is about.  For the price, unless you're just really craving your red meat, I'm not sure it's worth it for me anymore.  I will say that there used to be restaurants that really did great filet entrees and I never even considered paying John Thomas prices because places like Les Ducs, the Tavern at Maxies, and Rene's were much better options.  With none of these currently in existence, I'll admit that John Thomas is really the only place for steak. I guess John Thomas just bores the hell out of me.  I understand the desire to be a classic steakhouse, but at the same time a restaurant that never changes a single thing just isn't going to keep my interest in a city with so many options - especially considering the fact that it is the most expensive restaurant in town.  Also, the atmosphere is just weird.  I never want to see anyone serving me being forced to wear a bow tie.  And the plates make me feel like I'm eating at my grandma's house. I also just want to mention how totally shocked to hear so many people say this is the best steakhouse in the country.  Wow, I think people should go to steakhouses more often.  Off the top of my head, I would say that Barclay in Philly, Niros in Vegas, the Chop House in NH and Mooo in Boston all blow John Thomas away.  but to give JT credit, it's much cheaper than any of the places I just mentioned, and yes, Ithaca is a small city.

John Thomas has AMAZING steaks!!! I've been there twice, had the porterhouse for two both times, and they were soo good! We ordered it medium rare, and the steak was so soft and delicious!! And the steak sauce they have is super good too. For side dishes we tried the fries/onion rings, cream spinach, and wild mushrooms. I loved the mushrooms! The spinach and fries/onion rings were okay in my opinion. We also ordered the creme brulee and this raspberry thing for dessert. I thought the raspberry one was alright, but the creme brulee was so good! Definitely getting that again next time! The second time we went we got a private room because we wanted to show our graduating friend a video. Apparently they only have a screen, no projector, no connecting cord whatsoever. So we ended up not using the screen at all, so just be aware if anyone wants to use that! We also got a private room, it's 20% gratuity instead of 18% for parties of 5 or more. So it's a pretty good deal, and the private room is really nice! I will definitely be back for another dinner soon, I will find reasons/holidays to celebrate just to eat at John Thomas!
Fantastic restaurant!  A great place for a date with your someone special.   Steaks are always PERFECT-this is how steak should be prepared.  I hate to be let down when I order a filet mignon-and you won't be let down here!  Great wine selection, delicious family style sides to accompany your delectable entree.   The service is impeccable-well choreographed, attentive, not suffocating.  I never have to ASK for anything.  You'll feel like they are reading your mind-they know how to provide an enjoyable dining experience.   Some may consider it to be a little pricey (I plan to spend at least $150 for 2, with wine, etc) BUT, I'd rather spend the money where I know I'll have a fantastic experience than to spend less and risk a mediocre meal.
Yes, it's a great steakhouse.  John Thomas will cook your steak correctly and has all the basic cuts of meats that you would hope for.  Other than that, I don't know what all of the fuss is about.  For the price, unless you're just really craving your red meat, I'm not sure it's worth it for me anymore.  I will say that there used to be restaurants that really did great filet entrees and I never even considered paying John Thomas prices because places like Les Ducs, the Tavern at Maxies, and Rene's were much better options.  With none of these currently in existence, I'll admit that John Thomas is really the only place for steak. I guess John Thomas just bores the hell out of me.  I understand the desire to be a classic steakhouse, but at the same time a restaurant that never changes a single thing just isn't going to keep my interest in a city with so many options - especially considering the fact that it is the most expensive restaurant in town.  Also, the atmosphere is just weird.  I never want to see anyone serving me being forced to wear a bow tie.  And the plates make me feel like I'm eating at my grandma's house. I also just want to mention how totally shocked to hear so many people say this is the best steakhouse in the country.  Wow, I think people should go to steakhouses more often.  Off the top of my head, I would say that Barclay in Philly, Niros in Vegas, the Chop House in NH and Mooo in Boston all blow John Thomas away.  but to give JT credit, it's much cheaper than any of the places I just mentioned, and yes, Ithaca is a small city.
I consider myself something of a foodie, and definitely a steak lover, and John Thomas is hands down the best steakhouse, and one of the best restaurants, that I've ever been to. The service is impeccable.  It is not too stuffy or formal, yet the staff creates an elegant atmosphere. But the food, oh, the food!  Every steak I've ever had there has been perfectly cut, cooked, and seasoned.  All of the side dishes I've had have been perfectly cooked as well, and I had the best key lime pie of my life at John Thomas. When I leave Ithaca, John Thomas will be one of the things that I'll miss most.
John Thomas has AMAZING steaks!!! I've been there twice, had the porterhouse for two both times, and they were soo good! We ordered it medium rare, and the steak was so soft and delicious!! And the steak sauce they have is super good too. For side dishes we tried the fries/onion rings, cream spinach, and wild mushrooms. I loved the mushrooms! The spinach and fries/onion rings were okay in my opinion. We also ordered the creme brulee and this raspberry thing for dessert. I thought the raspberry one was alright, but the creme brulee was so good! Definitely getting that again next time! The second time we went we got a private room because we wanted to show our graduating friend a video. Apparently they only have a screen, no projector, no connecting cord whatsoever. So we ended up not using the screen at all, so just be aware if anyone wants to use that! We also got a private room, it's 20% gratuity instead of 18% for parties of 5 or more.

Great steaks, great drink menu, and outstanding service. I've been here several times. Though I spent a lot of money, I got what I paid for each time. Their cocktails are well made and the servers are usually pretty good in giving advice to pair drinks with food. Their side dishes typically come family style, so take note. I thought their mashed potatoes were rich, buttery, and delicious. The strength is obviously the steak, and the ones I've had do not disappoint. They have been full and meaty, always prepared the way I asked for. The restaurant claims to age its steaks in some special proprietary way -- I'm not sure if that has any real effect on the finished product, but the finished product is spectacular. We usually finish it all off with a nice port (they have several options). Start to finish, you get what you pay for.

If Yelp allowed 6 stars, this would be the only place I would EVER give it to. If hyperbole was ever acceptable, it's for a review of this place. Just thinking about this place I get excited inside like a school boy on a snow day, yet feel peace as if I'm on the beach with the sand between my toes and warm sun on my face. No matter what I write here, words cannot describe how amazing this restaurant is. I will try to convey this in the language of mere mortals, but nothing I can say will approach the sheer incredibleness (yes, that's a real word) and awesomeosity (not a real word) of this place. Simply put, BEST. RESTAURANT. EVER. You will hear me talk about this place as if it saved my life or cured a disease. For that I apologize in advance. But if steak could cure illness this place aint John Thomas, it's Jonas effing Salk. I wont go into the detail of the decor, as others have accurately described it as a homey cottage or farmhouse feel. Simply put, you feel welcome when you walk in. Especially on a cold Ithaca winter's day, it's like being invited into someone's home with a fire going and a nice warm blanket for you to cuddle up in while they make you the best meal of your life. Many people would balk at the thought that one of the greatest meals you can have in this country is in a small farmhouse in upstate New York. There may be crazy fancy 15 course meals around the world, exploring the edge of every taste bud's tolerance for new and exciting flavors, but none of them can compare to this comforting place that makes your mouth and soul happy in ways you can't imagine. I've been to restaurants around the world, from San Francisco to Barcelona, but the bar is always set at John Thomas. I lived in Ithaca for 6 years, and when I was a freshman in college my aunt and uncle took me here for dinner when they came to visit. I was hooked. I went back at least once a semester throughout the duration of my bachelors and masters degrees, always as a celebration of either a birthday or end of exams. It's the one place that I would treat myself to no matter how broke I was. It's not cheap, but it's worth every penny. The service is always amazing, the steaks are always cooked so perfectly your brain couldn't possible fathom the superhuman methods that must go into cooking them, and their house made steak sauce is so good they sell it by the jar on site. I dream about the Brie en Croute, and live for my next filet or prime rib. I live in California now but am always thinking about the next time I can fly to New York simply for a John Thomas dinner. Last time I was in NYC I made 4 friends drive 4 hours in a cramped rental car just for dinner here. They did not regret it. If I wasn't apprehensive about a cross-country long distance relationship with an inanimate object, I'd marry it. I love you. Until next time....
