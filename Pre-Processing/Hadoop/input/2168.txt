This review is for the Aerial Adventure Course only, My son and I spent 3 hours this past rainy Saturday taking on the challenges of this "ropes"/"confidence" course. Neither of us had done one of these before. We only got to the middle level of courses and found them hard. The layout is fun, creative, at times downright scary, and definitely challenging. Those challenges included figuring out how to best navigate an "element," overcome a natural discomfort of being on a wet steel cable or other obstacles 40 ft.+ in the air, and making your body move forward when you really want down. You also must clip yourself on and off of a safety line and zip line (see the video for details), You do get an initial orientation (Joe was excellent). There are staff everywhere on the ground to help, but you feel like you're doing this on your own which adds to the adrenaline rush and anxiety. Rest assured the safety harness system is as reliable as it is ingenious. I am not sure how anyone could make a better course, so Peek'n Peak earns 5 stars. And $44 for 3 hours of exhilarating climbing fun in the fresh mountain air is a good deal in my book. Check them out. Let me know what you think of this review by clicking a button below. Thanks.

Went to the Outdoor Adventure park and really enjoyed it...till we got rained out.  The place is really cool and the PK2 team was very helpful.  Would go again!

The Peak rocks. It's definitely not huge, the slopes aren't long or particularly challenging, and you aren't going to get the Vermont or Colorado experience... but there's something magical about this place. Night skiing here in particular is relaxing - it's quiet, the hills are no longer crowded, and you don't have to worry about bringing your A-game when going down the hills. If you're looking for jumps and places to do tricks, their terrain park is pretty spectacular. The new owners who bought this place in 2011 have redone every single room... so if you visited before then, the entire resort has seen major (and much needed) renovations. It's still a work-in-progress, but it's come a long, long way in the past couple of years, as the new owners are really trying to make an awesome place. Up from the main lodge now, take a trip up the lift and you can ski over to a great new bar where you can stop and get a quick Heineken or a mixed-drink to give you some courage before you hit the black diamonds. Another recent perk, they've added outdoor fire pits all over the resort, which kicks ass. Definitely worth checking out for a night or weekend.

This is a fun and beginner-friendly ski resort.  I love going here for romantic weekends with the hubby.  The slopes are manageable for me (I'm not a skier by any means), but there are some more challenging ones for people like my husband who actually enjoy facing their death while flying down mountains in sub-freezing temperatures.   The food around the resort is good, and the atmosphere is beautiful - the hotel looks so quaint set among the big hills.  We're going back soon, and this time I'll get to report on the spa!  Hooray!

This is a nice little option for a getaway for Clevelanders like me. Four stars is a bit generous, but hear me out. As a ski resort, it's a hill, not a mountain, but that keeps the lift lines short, and hey, it's still skiing. We stayed a night at the hotel, which had its good and bad points. The room is fine - think older Hampton Inn, but some areas need some immediate help. The carpets in our hallway had seen their share of melting ice and wet towels, and mildew and mustiness permeated the hallway. The public spaces of the inn are musty visually as well. Just rough around the edges and a bit timeworn. The pool area is pretty nice, but... The resort advertises itself as family-friendly, and boy are they ever. I barely like my own family, and the dozens of urchins belonging to strangers' families infesting the pool, screaming in the hallways, and even in the hot tub put a damper on the notion of relaxing and enjoying the amenities. More than one employee told me the staff is hoping the new owner makes some much needed capital investments. One said the whole place was "starting to look shabby" and rattled off everything from rusting lift towers to basic maintenance long overdue on buildings. I hope it gets better because it's a quick and inexpensive trip for me, and I'll likely be back until/unless the place lets me down.

came during the off-season for a wedding, which was beautiful.  Not a big skier, so wouldn't be interested in that. likes:  room with loft had plenty of space and a coffee maker (awesome), staff was friendly and helpful, ballrooms and common spaces were gorgeous in a rustic way dislikes:  room decor/furniture/TV were seriously outdated.  meal options are lacking (though the wedding reception was fab)...we ended up going to French Creek Tavern like every other yuppie at Peek'n Peak, be warned.  Mini-golf course was hilariously bad with ripped and worn green carpet.  It was so bad, you had to laugh. I chose $$ for the price range, bc we got the room for like $150/night

Peak'n Peek has always been a great charming place to ski. Generally good snow, an hour closer than holiday valley for those of us coming from Ohio. They have a good variety of runs, from easy winding paths to steeper blacks, a smattering of glade and mogul opportunities as well. Lifts are usually pretty quick, not terribly long lines, the staff is always friendly as well. If you get there right at opening, you'll have a good hour before you start to see any other skiers on your runs.

My dad and I were just discussing that out of all the ski resorts we've been to, including out west, this was our favorite. Peek'n Peak certainly doesn't have the most challenging ski terrain.  Some parts of the resort are even a bit run down.  The slopes aren't long, maybe half a mountain, if that, but the abundance of facilities around the resort make this place cozier than most anywhere else. Peek'n Peak is quaint.  But the slopes are lined with beautiful evergreen trees, making each run a scenic glide through the forest.  There are four different lodges where you can stop and rest, each with its own unique character.  The Sugar Shack (formerly Pizzaiolis) is a vaulted Italian restaurant with a sports bar and large window for eying the slopes.  The Main Lodge is a family friendly cafe, with a massive hearth and adjacent gift and rental facilities.  The Retreat is a great place for a beer or a Hot Buttered Rum when you're recovering from the challenges of the Peak's terrain park.  Lastly, at the top of the Peak you'll find a new golf pro shop that doubles as another stop for skiers and boarders alike. The Tudor style mansion-converted Inn-at-the-Peak is basically gorgeous.  It has a beautiful stone port cochere, a fancy restaurant, gift shop, breakfast eatery, and a pool area with all the amenities: sauna, fitness center, main pool, kiddie pool, an outdoor pool for the more temperate months, and an indoor/outdoor hot tub to boot.  This was the highlight of my most recent trip.  My date and I loved soaking in the hot tub while watching the snow fall. I stayed at the Camelot Condominiums.  They've seen some better days, but recently got new carpet.  Just waiting for some of the other elements to get a much needed update.  However, the one bedroom with a spiral staircase to the loft suited our needs just fine, making for a comfortable home away from home just off the slopes and within walking distance of the Sugar Shack. I can't wait to come back next year!

Pros: Fun place to for skiing, especially at night. The main building lodge rooms are very comfortable. There is a microwave and refrigerator in the room and a coffee pot.Great hours for the pool (open during the week from 8am until 10pm) and there is also a hot tub where you can enter from inside that goes outside. We were very excited to see a winter storm while sitting in the hot tub. Indoor playground is great for kids! Cons: We were very disappointed to learn that there would be no tubing until the weekend after we planned to visit. That was very disappointing! Wish you could ride the chair lift without skiing in the winter since I am not a skier. Beware food in the ski lodge and at the pool isn't the healthiest and can be a little pricey. Recommend bringing your own cooler and coffee carafe for over at the ski lodge.
We go annually and would not pick another location!
