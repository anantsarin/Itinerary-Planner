This new shop takes eco-friendly to a new level.  They are located in the atrium of the commons level (bottom level) of Carousel Mall in a oversized kiosk that is lit by the skylights above them.  It is, of course, built with all eco-friendly materials. The store carries three brands. The first brand, Sympl Jeans, which includes organic denim and a line of soft and lightweight tees that are made from superfine 100% organic Peruvian cotton. These reasonably priced knits come in several styles and great colors. Sympl Jeans also carries denim for both men and women that are available in a variety of washes and fits.  I bought myself a pair of of Simpl jeans that were on promotion for $59.50!  They're fantastic feeling, haven't stretched out at all after 3 wears, and fit very nicely.  They run big too, so, purchasing a size smaller than I usually wear was nice :) Eco University is the store's second brand, which is a line of young preppy knitwear that includes polos to rugbys. These are also made with 100% organic Peruvian cotton, so they're very soft, have a great fit, and comfortable feel. Lastly is the store's namesake brand Clothing for a Better Earth. This consists of several men's tees that have front pockets with complimenting logos, graphics, and slogans. When I was there, they were BRAND new and were having lots of great promotions.  I ended up walking away with a free hat with the Clothing for  Better Earth logo on the front.  (I will have no problem being a walking billboard for them!). The sales person working when I walked into this unlikely fashion hot spot was extremely friendly, helpful, and informative.  I thoroughly enjoyed my experience here, recommend it to everyone, and look forward to seeing it grow.
