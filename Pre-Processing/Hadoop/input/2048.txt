Seriously, Guy Fieri needs to feature the Audubon North on his show, Drive-ins, Diners & Dives. Thats how good it is. Whenever friends or family visit from back home, I take them here. I used to live across the street from this place and literally ate there every day for about two years. the food is amazing, everything is home made down to the bread that they use. You can literally point at anything on the menu and it will convince you to come back soon. Their specials are pretty fantastic. The people are awesome, from the owner to the employees to the fellow patrons. For the entire time I spent living in this neighborhood, the Audobon was essentially my living room where I watched sports, drank, laughed, and manjed on some terrific food. The memories i have forged here will last a life time. I still go back when I can. I have to go an hour out of my way most of the time when the craving is too strong for me to resist, but its totally worth it. Audubon North is awesome, Scotty is awesome, it is a MUST try.

I love this place. It's a total dive and the wings/chicken fingers are great. The chicken fingers on the pit are some of the best I've had. I've never had anything other than wings or chicken fingers here so I couldn't really tell you what anything else is like. The bar tenders/waitresses are friendly. You'll see a lot of regulars who will give you strange looks when you first come in. If you have a peanut allergy you shouldn't go here. They have peanuts in the shell in bowls all over the place. Great if you like peanuts, bad if you are allergic to them. Did I mention this place is a dive? The tables are folding plastic tables and the last time I was there they had lawn chairs for you to use at them. There is also carpet on the walls. If you want to go to a dive, this place is real gem.

It's a dive bar but that's not a bad thing in many cases.  The bartender was friendly.  I ordered a Beef on Weck.  Typical overcooked, dry, chewy shoe leather beef.  The bun was advertised as homemade but fell apart as I was eating.  Meh. The prices are very low. I might go back and try the wings sometime, I have been told they are very good here.

A friend from Buffalo had an apartment close by and cited it as his favorite place to hang out every weekend, so he took me for lunch the first time I went, which was a couple years ago.  We each had the chicken fingers, which are the best I've ever had.  I have since been back on both trips to Buffalo I've been on since June 2013. If this review was just based on the taste of the food, I'd give it 5 stars.  Seriously the best chicken fingers I've ever had.  I would never go to this place for healthy food, but it's amazing for what it is.  And the prices are really good as well. Unfortunately, I've had to wait a very long time both times I've been there recently, and it wasn't because the place was busy or they were understaffed.  I could see the grill from our table and watched as the server talked to the regulars and the other server/bartender at the bar before putting in our order and then the guy running the grill talked to people for a while before even starting to cook the chicken.   The beer selection is also so disappointing that I ended up just drinking water. If you like Bud or Molson, you've got it made, but if you want anything else, you're in trouble. Also, on our most recent trip, they were only playing a certain game on one of the many TVs in the place ,so a guy sitting at the bar kept coming over and standing uncomfortably close and looked right over my head, muttering or cheering.  I asked the server if they could put the game on another TV closer to the guy and she just laughed.  We ended up taking our food to go when it finally came out because it had taken so long to get it and I didn't want to be there anymore.

I'm a sailor so I'm most comfortable at a casual dive bar.  This is by far my favorite bar in the Amherst area. There is a mixed crowd here. From the sports fanatic (avoid MNF times if you want to drink your beer in peace) to the townie to the broke college kid.  The prices here are insanely low and the bartenders are wonderfully friendly with just the right amount of Sass - Jolene S is definitely my favorite! :) But seriously, the place is clean for a popular but down to earth sports bar.  The exterior looks like someone's house rather than a bar.  Monday nights have a $1.50 Rolling Rock pint special and 40 cent wing night.  I like to order mine extra crispy.  Seriously I'm new to Buffalo but I prefer the wings here over Duffs, Anchor Bar, and Gabriel's Gate.

By far the Best wings and Chicken fingers in Western New York. Everything is made from scratch and the bartender was very well endowed. If only I wasn't married. -Judy

*******AUDUBON NORTH BEEF AND KEG****** CHEAP DRINKS, GREAT FOOD - ESPECIALLY WINGS !!! Cheap drinks, super cheap pool table (25cent games!), friendly bartenders, uncomfortable bar stools, everything you could ask for in a dive bar PLUS a few surprises: Really, really good pub food especially fish fry and burgers, looks like a regular suburban house from the outside, clean little homey fish tank, and a nicely decorated clean ladies restroom? WTF? My super cheap sister and brother-in-law take me here right after they pick me up at the airport EVERY time I come to visit.... to satisfy my jonesin' for wings and they always offer to pay! Believe me, they are the biggest and best wings we have had recently. Sadly, even Duffs have been hit or miss. I always order hot and they provide plenty of real blue cheese. My wuss relatives prefer the BBQ but I have to admit those are pretty good too. Table service available, jukebox music only, darts and pool table. kids welcome with parents for lunch and dinner (we brought the 4 and 8 yr old to play pool, too... at dinnertime).. I know they are a small, cheap, dive bar but minus one star for not carrying Maker's Mark Bourbon. Sorry.

Service was on the ball. Atmosphere is rough. No heat - it was freezing. Smells like cigarette smoke, no bottled wine offered, limited menu. Would not recommend, much better options nearby to spend an evening out.

Have always wanted to check out this place.  I have heard that the wings are very good, but I did not try any.  I got a burger, which was fine but nothing special.  The typical bar food.

Saw some good reviews on yelp so decided to hop on over to this bar for some beer and wings. I was skeptical to say the least when I pulled into the parking lot to what looked like a house but couldnt have been more of an amazing surprise. All the staff are adorable and couldnt be nicer/more helpful. Cheap drinks and great food deals. The wings are some of the best I've eaten and I've been in buffalo for over 21 years and tried wings at every dive bar along the way. Chicken fingers hands down the best I've had - I'm pretty sure they make them fresh. They have 50 cent wings and 1.50 pints of rolling rock on mondays and everyday they do a great chicken finger and pitcher or wings and a pitcher deal. Not to mention they keep their kitchen open late - so hard to find decent food past midnight. Definitely one of the most under appreciated, hidden gems of the area.

Before you read on, please remember that this place is absolutely a dive. That being said, it is an excellent one. Best chicken fingers ever, hands down. They cut the fingers themselves - these guys were never frozen, never processed, always delicious. We used to frequent this place in college and I can't believe it took us so long to go back. The prices? It's as if they forgot it turned 1995. So cheap. (2 huge fingers, 1 homemade & also huge pierogi, with all the fixings, for $6.50?!?) The reason my review is missing one star: It was absolutely freezing. Not like, a little chilly... freezing. We kept our outside coats on the whole time we were there, which I think goes a little beyond the line of acceptable for a dive. My water, which admittedly came in a frosty mug and with lots of ice, actually became more frozen as we sat there. And this was after we moved tables to avoid the cool breeze falling from the ceiling!  If the place had been at least 62° I wouldn't have even mentioned it.

This place has amazing Wings, honestly love the bbq!

Much better than the Audobon South location, and the West and East are comparable. OK, I made that up. Went back there recently and the food didn't seem as good (or as juicy) as the old times. Lovely cozy dingy-bar atmosphere, delicious and cheap wings, fantastic beef on weck, and awesome specials. This is one of those places that is quintessential Buffalo area. It's well worth a trip. You won't be disappointed! I recommend their Weck & Wings special. Mmmmmm. This place represents what is great about Buffalonian cuisine... it's so Buffalo. It's adorable, and the food is excellent and cheap. I used to live just down the road from here so it has great memories for me. I could walk here from my house and sometimes did (brr). Let me say a few things about Buffalo. Buffalo has some of the best * food on earth. What Buffalo is famous for is Wings and snow. And Niagara Falls. And never quite winning any sports championships. But it should be famous for food in general. I'm talking cheap, local, original, unique food perfection, and tons of it. This city is an absolute foodie paradise. It has some amazing Thai, Chinese, Indian, Puerto Rican, BBQ, Polish... it has my fave Italian on earth (Michael's among many more), it has the best Chicken Souvlaki on earth (Alton's, among many more), the best Pizza on Earth (Imperial, Paulys, Bozannas, Zips, and many more), the best Wings by far (Zips and many more), the best meat sandwiches (Charlie The Butcher's and more), the best bar food, the best fish sandwich (Bailey Seafood), it's just incomparable as far as small towns go. I got very lucky when I randomly ended up living there and was able to discover all this culinary magic over time.

Great spot to grab some good homemade food, including the chicken wings and fingers! The fingers are so soft and tender... mmm they are delicious! I love ordering the Garlic Pasta. It's yummaayy in maahhh tummaayy. Also, try the sandwiches here. I had a BLT sandwich, and it actually had yummy fresh tomatoes, tasty crunchy bacon, and leafy GREEN lettuce. The bread was toasted nicely, although a little sensitive for my mouth (too scratchy). I also recommend the Long Island Iced Tea, it's great! It was served in a tall beer mug with some ice. It was tasty! The food and drinks are cheap, and there are combos available for the food too.

The first couple of times I went to Audubon North were amazing. Great food, good prices, smelled a bit like a urinal and was a bit dingy at best, but it's a dive bar, what do you expect?  You aren't paying for atmosphere! We were bringing travelers from all across the United States and the world to experience a taste of Buffalo, so it's close location to our apartment and cheap eats were definitely appealing. The problem is that the food really seemed to go down hill over the last 6 months or so. If it was only one or two bad times, I would have let it go, but it was 3 times in a row that we just were satisfied. The chicken wings and fingers tasted gamy, had a bit of an after taste to them that was a bit unpleasant. The french fries were a soggy mess, even when we asked if they could make them crispy. They were not crispy, they were just burnt. When we told the waitress about it, she asked us what we wanted her to do about it, and was generally unhelpful. The wait time for food has also been excessive, at the most recent visit it took an hour and a half to get food for three people, and there was only one other couple ordering food. We also decided to do the carryout one day, and they had a carryout service charge, as well as a charge for every single Styrofoam container used. I may give them another try in the future, because they used to be great, but for now, I would stay away.

This is a small divey bar close to a residential neighborhood in Amherst. I used to live around the corner and my friends Mom works here so we'd visit often for the awesome wings and cheap drinks. Monday nights (I think) are wing nights and they're So. Good. They make them really spicy too- if that's your thing. The beer is cheap here and all the other food always sounds so good. My favorite is the $1 pints of rolling rock! They also have an old fashioned juke box for some added fun.
