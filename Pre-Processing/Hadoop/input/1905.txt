A classic case of never judge a book by its cover.  The Hobnobbin Pub is an old, rustic looking building located just outside of the heart of Poughkeepsie, on Vassar Road.  The inside of this establishment is very home style and warm and welcoming.  We were quickly seated and treated to very fast and friendly service.  The dining room is however extremely quiet. Some music would have broken the awkward silence.  Obviously this is by no means a problem of any sort and the food would soon become music to my mouth!      We each ordered a burger (The Hobnobbin platter) and a small order of wings.  We had the "Hotter" sauce and requested a side of the "Hottest" sauce.  The wings are perfectly sized and even more perfectly cooked.  The real star of the night was the homemade sauces.  Our Hotter sauce was delicious.  It was unlike any traditional wing sauce I've ever had, there were tons of peppers and other flavors perfectly combined in this sauce. The heat was good as well, the Hottest sauce left a burn on my tongue for moments after I had finished eating, just how we like it.  My burger was also incredible.  A large patty of meat, with bacon lettuce tomato on a fresh bun.  Very thick and very juicy.  It was pretty clear why both the wings and burgers, are award winning at Hobnobbin.  The chili was not bad either, in fact it was very good!   Hey if you guys are in the Poughkeepsie area, or even if you're not, Hobnobbin is worth the trip.  The "Hottest" sauce was one of the best sauces I have ever tasted! \ Definetly go for the the platter with an appetizer of wings if its your first time! THE HOBNOBBIN' PLATTER Jumbo burger topped with cheese and bacon, served with lettuce and tomato, steak fries, onion rings and side of chili.... YUM! facebook.com/wingtour
The service was good enough, but the food was underwhelming. I know they specialize in pub food but it was fairly greasy. Cheese fries came with neon orange nacho cheese from a tube on them. Burgers were passable. We probably won't go back.

Another place claiming to have "The Best Burger in Town" and "award-winning wings"....but ultimately a disappointment. I recently went here for the first time after years of hearing about how great the burgers were. In reality, they were nothing special at all. The burgers were dry, flavorless chunks of meat, and no different than ones you reluctantly eat at a summertime backyard BBQ. I ordered one of the "Little Burgers" and it was in an almost meatball shape, with one slice of American cheese on a small, dried out, seemingly store-bought bun. It was overcooked and well-done, when I asked for it medium well. There is a difference, you know. A suggestion would be to at least flatten the chunk of meat into a PATTIE, that's usually how burgers are made, it's not rocket science. The wings were also lackluster...small, dry, way too crispy and overcooked to the point where the bones were practically crumbling. The sauces were bland.   If the food wasn't bad enough, the restaurant itself is far from appealing. Seriously, this place looks like it should be on "Restaurant Impossible"-it could use a makeover. The dining area is pretty dingy, with peeling wallpaper, paint-chipped ceiling, poor lighting, and dirty firewood piled on the floor next to the tables. Add in a dirty, cobweb-adorned restroom and some shady characters hanging out in the bar (the Vanilla Ice and Eminem wannabes....please stop, you look ridiculous), and it was just a crummy experience all-around. The service was ok but not enough to save Hobnobbin'  from one-star status.

Bar always smells funny, needs more craft beer selections.  Like this place to drink, but that's about it.

We love this place.  Yes it could use a renovation, but the wings and burgers are supreme, and so are the nachos.  The one reviewer that had a bad burger must've been an anomaly, we love the burgers here, always fresh and juicy. Haven't found better wings yet.  You can get hot or mild, we love the hot but with tons of honey, and they are very accommodating. Place is cozy and quiet, I'm not sure what the other reviewers mean by regulars in the dining room, although I've been going sporadically for 20 years I don't feel like a regular and no one makes me ever feel out of place.  Staff has always been friendly. Def worth a visit.

My family and I frequent the Hobnobbin' Pub about 2x a month.  It's a great neighborhood pub that is perfect for a burger or a beer.  We love it because the service is always fast and friendly and the food is consistent and at a fair place.  Yes the place is a dive, can't argue with that but I don't mind.  They also have a great frequent diner promotion that gives you a $25 gift card after you spend $250.  Definitely check it out if you are in the area.

Three words...hot garlic wings. Might be the best wings I've ever had. Burger was great too.

I've never felt so uncomfortable in a restaurant.  This is the type of place that if unless you're a regular, you are treated like an outsider.  I mean you walk in and all conversations stop and heads turn in your direction. No lie, this happened.  I'm not uptight by any means and I have no problem with dives, but this is a dump! The over priced food was bland and skimpy.  Worst wings I've ever had and the burger was a disappointment.  Maybe some dust from the window sill would have added some flavor.  If I think too long about the time and money wasted in this place, it makes me want to punch a wall.   I'm never going to this place again.

I had dinner in the bar while watching a Yankee game.  The burger/wings option was great.  I loved the burger and the wings were better than I thought they would be.   John the bartender is fantastic and the atmosphere was fun and friendly.

I have only been here a handful of times (for a drink or to take out wings), and it's always been good-but  the last time REALLY impressed me. I ordered wings to take out and left a tip on my credit card. I realized much later after reviewing my bank account that the tip was entered incorrectly when the transaction was closed out. I know it was an honest mistake-I have been a server/bartender in the hospitality industry for years and understand that these things happen all of the time. I called and asked to speak to a manager and the person who answered said that he was not available. She was extremely polite and took all of my information, apologizing for the mistake. The manager called me back within a day and apologized profusely. I asked him if he could credit my card. He said that since the transaction had been closed out, there was no way to do this. He asked me if I frequent the establishment, suggesting that he would just give me the cash next time I visited. I told him that I don't and told him not to worry about it because it wasn't a big difference. He absolutely INSISTED that I get it and asked me for my home address. He kept apologizing for the oversight and was extremely nice about the situation. A few days later, I received the cash difference in the mail along with a gift card. This was by far one of the best customer service experiences I've ever had in my entire life. Way to go, Hobnobbin! It's nice to see that businesses like this still exist in this crazy, fast-paced world we live in where everyone is just a number.
