This is the best NY style pizza that I've found in the area. Crispy slices and fast service. Located between a few bars, so certainly good "drunk pizza".

The place is super convenient for me; pretty much right on my walk home. I came here expecting to find the $0.99 pizza mentioned below. I guess they jacked up their prices since then. It was $2.50 for cheese, $3.00 for pepperoni, and $3.50 for specialty slices. When I walked in, only two kinds of specialty pizzas were shown so I guess they won't have a lot of options available at any time. They apparently have wings too but the price wasn't listed on the menu, aside from a $15 combo deal. I got the pepperoni. It's not great pizza, but good enough to get the job done. Pepperoni and cheese were pretty decent. The crust was a little burnt though, but not terribly so. Still, I'd prefer if I didn't have that taste in my mouth. Service was pretty good, at least when I walked in. I guess with the number of drunk kids who come here, a sober person walking home from studying is very much welcomed any time. It was kinda entertaining today though when some super stoned kid was just sitting in there and tried to order slices with no money. I'll probably be back out of sheer convenience, not really because of the quality of the establishment.

Best New York style pizza I've had in Ithaca to date, but only plain or pepperoni. Their other toppings are of poor quality and carelessly applied. Made the mistake of ordering the buffalo chicken pizza one time and it was awful- dry, flavorless, and the chicken looked and tasted like turkey cold cuts. The one time I ordered sausage it was burnt black before being unevenly sprinkled on top. Veggies have been equally disappointing. Stick to the basics here and you won't go wrong.

A good tasting New York style pizza, Garlic Knots are very good. Over all they have a solid pizza.

This place is all around terrible! 1.) Counter guy is a brain-dead douchey bro who picked up his customer service skillz from a rock. 2.) Pizza is thin crust, burnt, inedible cardboard. 3.) Cross-marketing handouts for Loco next door are annoying and sleazy. Ladies night, anyone? 4.) Slice prices are the highest in Ithaca for some of the worst in Ithaca. Wouldn't take my worst enemy to The Connection.

I used to say there is no such thing as bad pizza, then I went to The Connection. There is nothing to like about this place. There are no prices for pizza on the wall or anywhere in the place. A slice is $2.50 and smaller than other Collegetown places. The garlic knot I had was not cooked in the middle at all and still cold. The women working the counter were very condescending and unpleasant. Go somewhere else for pizza besides here.

Because sometimes all you got is a buck and all you want is a mediocre slice of cheese pizza. Its kind of like taco bell's dollar menu, but for people stranded at Cornell without a car. Ahah a 99 cent cheese slice will hold me over til dinner, boom! Finally a solution to the "I'm broke and forgot to make lunch" problem. This new 99 cent cheese slice deal actually solves many problems, like the I'm hungry and just got kicked out of the chapter house after I spent too much on booze and I stupidly forgot to take advantage of their free popcorn problem. Or the I've been working out hard at the Noyes recreation center and can't afford the rip off prices at the food-mart next door problem. Ooh this shitty slice of pizza will suffice as a workout recovery snack, I'm sure there is some protein or something in here. Or the I've been studying at the library/working at the lab all day and forgot to eat lunch, if only there was cheap food on the way home problem. *if you can't tell this rant/update was brought to you by a poor grad student excited about the new special, 99 cents for a slice of cheese pizza, definitely worth an extra star.
The connection is CONVENIENT. I love a good reliable late night delivery place. The food is generally unremarkable for the price but...get the brownies. Get the brownies--they are unbeatable. Fudgy in the middle and crisp on top with your choice of fillings. Also, where else in town will bring you a fat free frozen yogurt with your choice of berries mixed in? Dessert after midnight WIN.

We're new to the area from a much larger community and were looking for a place with a large menu to suit our varied tastes. Nearly verything we had from here was phenomenal! Garlic parm wings with actual shredded parm cheese on top- fabulous. The slices are true NY style thin crust, which we appreciate. The garlic knots are a weird shape but decent, though the dough itself could use more oomph. Maybe more spices? They missed an item in our order and gave us extra pizza to make up for it. This is absolutely our go to place for 'pub fare' type Â food in the area! The prices seem about par with what we're used to paying. (EDIT: They've changed something about the garlic parm wings and they were awful the last time I ordered.)

WTF. This is not a baguette. This is a soggy sub. No one in the world would order diced tomato, shredded old mozzarella and basil pesto on a soggy white sub. They would order tomato, fresh mozzarella and basil pesto on a BAGUETTE, which is what the menu said I was ordering. Worst $13 I ever spent. Positives: friendly deliver driver, convenient hours. Also, wtf happened to pretzels?

Don't go to The Connection! ORDER from them and you'll have a good experience! I have good memories of my roommate and I ordering massive pretzels with dipping sauces, wings, cookies, and other yummy things. We would order during the small hours of the morning when nothing else was open. That's what makes the Connection great. Their menu offers about every type of food that was ever invented, so you'll be able to find something you're craving. I appreciate their effort.

this pizza is great if you like thin crust. we got a build your own pizza with roasted chicken, roasted red peppers, spinach, and artichoke hearts. Â there could have been more chicken on the pizza but other than that we were satisfied with the crust and sauce flavor as well as the other topping portions. the price seemed decent for 4 toppings on a 14" (less than $16). Â we picked our pizza up and it was hot and ready at the time we were given when we ordered. Â i would def. recommend the place especially to those who frequent the chapter house since it is right next door!

This place has relocated from Rogan's Corner since I moved away in 2010. Their late night munchies used to be sooooo delicious and memorable! Giant Birthday Cookies, Muddy Buddies, Southwest Nachos, mmmmm! I remember the good ol' days of playing Food Friendzy and winning super $10 coupons from them, then my friends and I would go spend "$30" (but really pay $10). I wish I could recapture those memories Â of birthdays and Harold and Kumar-style adventures that always ended with the sweet, mouth watering deliciousness of The Connection. They used to be a five star late night confectionary delight to my tastebuds. When 2009 came around, unfortunately, the quality of this place went downhill. Their delivery service has become horrible, and it's noticeable they're using cheaper ingredients in the food to widen their profit margins. Then again, The Connection was never a good value for the money to begin with. I will always love their giant flurries and confections, without a doubt. The rest of their food is now a shame though! I hope that one day, when I come back for a visit, the entire experience of The Connection can win my heart again. And they will go back to being Confection Connection, the way they originally started ;)

Finally, it's under new management. They're currently having a special price on the pizza (probably to re-attract people). It's delicious stuff, and it's only $1 for a cheese/pepperoni slice, and like a $1.70 for speciality slices. Definitely go. It's awesome again.

To-die-for cookie pies. We got them for delivery and they were out of this world! Lots of toppings to chose from too.

The Connection's floor space is too small -- it can't support many customers, which is unfortunate given its hope of providing harbor for the drunken masses kicked out of the Chapter House at closing time at 1 AM. The food is expensive and not particularly good. The staff is fairly indifferent to your existence. It's sort of a dive. When going out for drinks in the area, appoint a Designated Discourager to be watchful, so that you don't accidentally end up at The Connection at the end of the night.
