6/30/2014 On my way back to VA from my 40 year class reunion at Pine Valley Central. Just had to stop at Johnny's get my Texas Hot fix on my way back. Used to hit Johnny's every Saturday night either before or after the races at Stateline Speedway. Got the usual of 3 hots and 3 burgers - price has gone up a little in the last 40 years but the taste is just as good. Couldn't eat all six in on sitting though, had three to take back to VA. Two of my friends would down 9 or 12 hots on some of those late nights. Got some sauce to bring home along with some Sahlen wieners from Tops and will make some of my own the rest of the week. This is a great place, everyone needs to eat here at least once in their life!
I have only one complaint no Logan berry ..... Ice shavings are perfect esp when you add a styrofoam cup almost perfect last step would be logan berry ... But man everything was very good and very clean
I've been going to Johnny's for years and I've never been disappointed. Absolutely the best chili dogs I've had anywhere (in the whole northeast part of the country). Very fast and very good. Also locally owned and lots of interesting local history.
Hearing that Texas red hots with special/secret sauce were a famous local specialty of my place of birth (Jamestown), I just had to give it a try while in town. According to my local family members, a few places do these hot dogs with special sauce, each claiming to be the best and/or original but Johnny's is not only the best but the true original. Grandma says this place is still run by the same family that ran the original location in Buffalo Square downtown 50+ years ago when she and Grandpa were dating and that the booths here are either the same ones or really good remakes. In any event, Johnny's dogs and burgers are only $0.98 each but you can also get deals on larger numbers and combinations. They come with mustard, onions and special sauce - and the sauce really is all it's cracked up to be. At first it didn't taste like much, but as you take a few more bites you get the full effect of the spices and the spiciness of the black pepper. The dogs are sliced for max sauce-dog contact, service is efficient like a well-oiled (family run) machine, and the place is clean, bright and has its own small parking lot. My only criticism of Johnny's is the tiny, thin buns they use. A slightly heartier bun would perfect this local treat and make it a more satisfying meal, but I still highly recommend this local institution. I hear you can have the sauce delivered, which I'll look into when I get back to SF.
Johnny's Lunch is a 78-year-old regional institution whose delicious hot dogs earn every profession of admiration they get. The memory of those mild, tender dogs topped with Johnny's spicy secret sauce, yellow mustard and chopped raw onion stays with you even longer than the fragrance of the aforementioned ingredients on your clothes (and that's a long time) ;) My Lakewood, NY-born wife and I returned with our son this week after a 10-year hiatus when visiting last week for a family reunion. Her parents moved to South Carolina a long time ago and we just don't get out that way (far western NY State). We seriously considered a trip from Boston to Jamestown just for Johnny's more than a few times. They are that good. For the unfamiliar, they are kind of like Texas Wieners; very similar to the venerable Libby's Lunch or the original, now dearly-departed, Falls View, both in Paterson, NJ. But Johnny's are an original creation; from the specially made dogs to the smooth consistency and exotic spice of the sauce. BTW, you can get that sauce on a hamburger, too. If you live within 100 miles of Johnny's, treat yourself to a hot dog standard bearer. They must be eaten in threes. Well, that's not technically a requirement, but they cut you a deal on the already low price of $1.20/dog. And get a chocolate malt. The extra $0.90 for the malt is worth it.

Serious guy, this place is awesome!  Its been a local favorite for as long as i can remember and about 50 years+.  But you have to go the original one in Jamestown NY.  I have the fondest happiest memories of eating at this place and everytime i go home i bring all my guests to Johnny's. The bugers and hot dogs are what is all about.  Dear god, they are off the chain.  If almost as if god himself designed the perfect pile of slop heaping with onions and wonder bread goodness. Look i am just upset as the next guy that they started franchising this place - BUT i'm not even kidding it is out of this world.  Like i said the orginal location in Jamestown is still basically like walking into someone's house with all the orginal signage. Oh and the coolest part is how they scream out your name like an angry grandmother when your order is up. I really really hope you hit this place up and eat till you puke.  I live in San Francisco now but i still get tears in my eyes everytime i'm drunk at 3am and am only craving one messy sloppy thing.  Oh Johnny, wherefore art thou? I'm going back for a wedding in October and i'm going there first on my way home from the airport - thats even before i see my own mother, son!
Three stink dogs with fries and a MALTED chocolate shake - STAT! This place as well a AJ's Texas Hots in the city are Chautauqua County staples. Find time for these some day if you're traveling through. Don't forget to roll your windows down or eat in a well ventilated area... they tend to make you smell... smell like AWESOME.
Johnny's is a local institution and the best place ever to get a hot dog. I've been a patron of Johnny's for over half a century, since the days when it was located in downtown Jamestown. Eek! I shudder to think I am that old but my longevity has afforded me the opportunity to indulge in many delightful hot dog dinning experiences over the years; especially at Johnny's. It's the only place I know of where the rolls are fresh steamed, the hot dog tenderized and then served with the most delicious Texas style meat sauce to be found on this planet. Of course they also serve burgers, fries and other things, but the place is still all about hot dogs. For what it is, a hot dog place, Johnny's is number one.

Locals proclaim this place have the best sauce on the planet... Which I won't dispute after giving it a try. The dogs and burgers are delicious if you are looking for some good old fashioned eating! Be prepared... They are messy! I throughly enjoyed the dogs. All and all food is fantastic and worth a try. Service is okay and effective, although if you're a Southern California native such as myself you may get looked up and down a few times if you appear out of place. It's definitely a local place with that mom and pop diner style. Employees appear to be good at what they do but were not as helpful as they could have been, me clearly being non-local and a beginner at the establishment with menu questions. I appreciated the food which was top notch and parking/ location. Despite this being a good old fashion eatery in a relatively small area a bit of modernization and plate presentation wouldn't kill them. Food is a five, absolutely. My four rating is mainly due to lack luster presentation and employees ineffectively answering menu questions (although still sweet and kind)

Oh hells yes! I miss these hot dogs. Loaded with onions and sauce and mustard. Mmmmmmm.... Cheap and heavenly. Go here - I know I will when I visit!

If you're within a two-hour drive of Jamestown, NY, a meal at Johnny's Lunch alone is worth the trip. Let me walk you through my usual, which I dream about most nights: Chocolate milk shake. Onion rings. 2 hot dogs with everything: Short beef franks topped with mustard, onions, and Johnny's signature sauce, the bun soaked through with the delicious, mysterious brown goodness. 1 burger, same as the dogs. I don't get it. I just don't get it. When I first moved to Jamestown, all my friends told me I had to try Johnny's. It sounded gross. When I finally relented, the dogs looked just as gross as I imagined -- these short little things smothered in this weird brown sauce. But I tried them, and I couldn't believe that such a tasty combination could exist. The sauce is extraordinary. I don't even know how to describe it -- it's not a meat sauce, it's not a hot sauce, it's not chili. It's brown, and it's mysterious, and the way it combines with the flavor of the dogs, the onions, and the mustard is heavenly. I could easily gobble down one of these in two bites, and I could just as easily gobble down 10 of these in one sitting. Here's the part I don't get: once you try them, you're hooked, the way one can get hooked on booze, or cigarettes, or drugs. That's what everyone told me, and I didn't believe it, but it was true. If enough time goes by, you start to crave it, and the craving becomes more and more unbearable until you'd crawl through the desert on your hands and knees for days without water just to reach the oasis that is Johnny's Lunch. I don't know what they put into the sauce, but it is incredibly addictive. Maybe they do slip something in that requires rehab to get you back to normal. Not that I'm complaining. One thing is for sure, though -- once you try Johnny's Lunch, assuming you order everything on the dogs, you'll never be the same again.

Firstly, I have to say that it does dissapoint me that Johnny's Lunch has started franchising.  Whats the harm in having a proud one-and-only location? Being a kid from Buffalo, i do very much enjoy texas hots, and my other reviews will point to Louie's on Elmwood and Hodge.  I have to say though, Johnny's has em beat!  The sauce here is a little lighter, and i believe slightly sweeter and spicier maybe?  Its more similar to a gravy than a chili I suppose.  It goes well on thier burgers and on the texas-fries as well.  The servers are always very friendly, especially the two guys, Michael and Robbie. Anyone in either Buffalo or the Northern Virginia (where i currently live) area that i talk to and happen to be from or have visited Jamestown always get a big smile on thier face when i talk to them about Johnny's lunch.

We always make a stop at Johnny's whenever we're in Jamestown.  The food is delicious and super cheap!  The friendly family atmosphere is amazing.  My husband's family  has been going to Jamestown for over 30 years, and they know everyone at the store by name.  In fact, "Mama" even had to approve of me before my husband and I got married. The Texas Hots are fabulous with their spicy sauce.  For the life of me, I can't figure out how to make it.  Any suggestions, since we don't get to Johnny's too often from here in Texas?

Growing up in Southwestern New York, Johnny's Lunch has always been the place to go to while visiting Jamestown.  I have many great memories about eating there with my parents, with our sports teams after a game etc...  Hot dogs and burgers, with Johnny's secret Texas Hot sauce is amazing.  Just writing about this place makes me want to take a quick trip down I-86.  Every down and then Johnny's offers 'Hot Dog Soup', which is like a minestrone with hot dogs cut up.  Try their in store made rice pudding....excellent!  I have to take a few for the road it's so tasty!
Oh hells yes! I miss these hot dogs. Loaded with onions and sauce and mustard. Mmmmmmm.... Cheap and heavenly. Go here - I know I will when I visit!
I have always been a huge fan, but I stopped today to try the Chicago dog. It was inadequate at best. No neon green relish, no dill pickle, and banana instead of sports peppers. Let down.  Stick with the traditional texas hot and fries.

I've lived in Jamestown all my life, and whenever I'm in Lakewood I always stop at Johnny's. It's the BEST restaurant in town and if you find yourself near Jamestown or Lakewood I urge you to stop by and order one with everything. Friendly and super fast service, great hot food. It's always packed but they're fast enough that you never have to wait more than 5 minutes. Their milkshakes are the bomb, and the cheese fries with johnny's sauce aren't half bad either. Like I said, you'll be sorry if you don't take 10 minutes out of your day and stop at Johnny's lunch

Heard so much about this place. Definitely a must see. They have outstanding food. This is old school hotdogs and hamburgers at its best. I am from and live in Oklahoma and came up to visit mother-in-law. My wife was the one that said I had to try. I am glad I did. The service was very friendly. The place was clean and kept up. I will definately come again when I am in the area. Gotta get the 3 for $3.25 all the way.

Even TEXAS it self doesn't make Texas Hots the way Johnny's Lunch does. There burgers and chicken sandwiches are not that great, but if you stick with some texas hots and fries you will not be sorry... (well.. maybe later ;) )

Heading to New Hampshire with friends.  Found Johnny's lunch on Yelp.  Love the food and mom and pop feel.  Definitely worth trying.  We were not the least bit disappointed.  Anyway, Jamestown is the birthplace of Lucille Ball, my favorite comedian as a child.

Great food, great service, friendly staff, super clean, bright/sunny dining room, charming, whimsical, and fun. What more could you want?
