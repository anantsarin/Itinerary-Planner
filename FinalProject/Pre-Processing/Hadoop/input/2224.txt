Had built up an appetite hiking the state parks and decided to get some local flavor - and we were not disappointed.   Awesome staff that was friendly with just the right amount of moxie, clean, open, and the food was amazing . Our server suggested our cocktails and the brunch bowl was AH-MAY-ZING. Highly suggest. My only regret was in deciding not to have a cupcake. If you go , have one for me .

Had a really nice brunch here! Not the most innovative brunch menu out there, but definitely well executed and tasty. I went with the brunch bowl and a side of the meatloaf. The brunch bowl was a good sized bowl of black beans, potatoes, guacamole, salsa, cheese, topped with an egg. Meatloaf also gets a thumbs up. Nothing particularly special, but tasty nonetheless. They also make their own chipotle sauce, which was pretty great and added some nice kick. What really won me over on their brunch was their vegan cupcakes. I don't usually go for vegan desserts, because I am not even remotely vegetarian (let alone vegan) and vegan dessert options tend to be disappointing approximations of the real deal. But they had an earl grey cupcake that intrigued me, and it was fantastic. Perfect ending to a solid brunch. Their tagline is "fancy-free brunch," and they more than achieve that goal. While it's not the most impressive brunch you can get an Ithaca, if you're looking for a quiet, relaxing brunch, this is the place.

Favorite brunch place in Ithaca! But it's such a long walk from where I live :( Came to brunch with my boyfriend and we had the cinnamon buns (yum!) and then we had the brunch bowl and meatloaf. The brunch bowl is like a burrito bowl -- breakfast edition. The meatloaf is a bit heavy for breakfast/brunch, in my opinion. They start serving cocktails at noon and the choices seemed interesting, but we didn't order anything. Service is great and it's a very cute place for brunch (we sat outdoors in the alleyway -- sounds sketchy, I know, but it was cute) and I definitely recommend it!

Hands down, the best cocktails in Ithaca. I keep coming back for the London (a mixture of gin and tea that would warm the heart and of any English(wo)man) alone. It's also hard to complain about the availability of small food items throughout the night, including a cabinet of gourmet cupcakes sitting at the bar. It can feel a bit too small at times - when it's nice out, the Westy next door is the better option - but it's one of the best bets in town if it's not too packed.

Great cocktails, good vibe. A bit on the small side, so it probably fills up quickly on busy nights. And they offer stickers :-)

Ithaca's best cocktail bar. Expensive by Ithaca standards but cheap for anyone who usually regulars cocktail bars in any big city. Have many inventive cocktails and menu is seasonal. All of the more interesting liquor options are house-infused using vegetables from the restaurant's garden. Kind of a weird interior though. Has a 1950's interior with aluminum tables. Would absolutely love it if had a better ambiance but the cocktails speak for themselves.

Excellent all around - I can't wait to come back. I had a vegan version of their food bowl - it was excellent.  They are very willing to substitute things that you may not like for their seasonal offerings.  So, I ended up having apple/cabbage mix in it as well as the normal stuff.  Delicious. Although I didn't get to partake, the drinks look wonderful. And then there were cupcakes.  Homemade, vegan, and unique flavors. They were heavenly.  In fact, next time I might just eat cupcakes and drink.  That's called heaven. Everything hit the spot for a great brunch, our waitress was so nice and friendly, the decor was great.  Basically, what I'm saying is, you gotta try this place at least once.

Fig infused bourbons, cucumber infused vodkas, chartreuse?  I'm sold.  An excellent selection of  creative cocktails at extremely reasonable prices.  Mixology meet Ithaca... Clientele seems to be made of regulars and the cliquey.  Come with friends, not alone.  Location is also a bit outside of college town.

The drinks are superb.  Probably the best cocktails in town.  Whether you prefer classic cocktails or something more experimental, you are sure to find a cocktail you'll really enjoy.  The bartenders are very knowledgeable (and nice) so make sure to consult them if you're unsure about what to order.   I'll also point out that this is one of the few bars where you can get a cocktail or mixed drink made with entirely or mostly local ingredients.  5 stars for the drinks indeed! Also, the cupcakes.  Oh, the cupcakes.  This is one of the few places that can turn a mediocre night out into a GREAT night out, and that is because of these cupcakes.   Felicias also now serves brunch, which is why I've waited until today to write this.  My first and only time so far having brunch here went extremely well!  Two of us ordered the brunch bowl, two ordered the fritatta of the day, and one ordered the breakfast sandwich.  We also had a cinnamon roll.  Everything was delicious, nothing was overcooked, and everything was just the right portion.  A lot of the ingredients were locally sourced.  I prefer my food a bit more strongly spiced but they do have a nice chipotle hot sauce which went great with the egg and cheese in my layered bowl.  I will definitely come here again for brunch as I enjoyed the overall experience much more than other brunch places in town.

Felicia's is a hoot!  My friend and I were in town for a wedding and ended up at Felicia's on a Friday night and had such a good time that we went back Saturday night and Sunday morning for brunch.  We felt like it was the sister bar of our neighborhood bar back in Manhattan, the Cubbyhole.  Woody, the bartender on Fri and Sat, definitely made us feel like we'd walked into our own neighborhood bar with a warm welcome and really friendly conversation.  The vibe was eclectic and accepting, no matter your orientation, style, or shtick. Out of our three visits I have to say my favorite was brunch.  Now, as every good gay boy, brunch is the highlight of my week so I may be biased, but taking such a good evening/night vibe and crowd and slapping some sun and good food on it is enough to make me giddy. We were served in a delightfully familial style by Amelia and her team of Felicias ("We are all Felicia"). I had a delicious fritatta of horicort verts, onions, and dill creme fraiche and my friend had a great blend of fruit and granola.  We finished with a strawberry and rhubarb cupcake with goat cheese frosting... GOAT CHEESE FROSTING!  If that wasn't the most clever frosting I've ever had, I'm a goat myself.  Alright, I'm getting rowdy.  Time to wrap up: Pros: 50's decor Very welcoming staff An obvious passion for good (local) food and mixology (tons of infused liquors) Great crowd Did I mention the goat cheese frosting? Cons: I didn't get laid

Now, a fresh and fun Sunday brunch is available in Ithaca!  And not only that, it boasts, for me at least, the tastiest Bloody Mary I have ever consumed at Felicia's Atomic Lounge. Okay, so let's start at the beginning as I was getting a bit too excited. Sundays at Felicia's Atomic Lounge takes the artisanal cocktail bar that we love for music, drunken dogs, evenings under the stars --with lights on and sun streaming though  the windows, transforming into a homey, relaxed room where you can share brunch with friends, family and enjoy the great playlist in the background. What to eat? More like, what not to eat! I am partial to the Brunch Bowl, a layered bowl of black beans, eggs, cheese, potatoes, salsa, guar and the surprise ingredient, butternut squash to fuse it all together. The breakfast meatloaf is delicious and is always ordered by someone we are dining with. There is always a Frittata offering, always fresh and always with an original, seasonal vegetable and herb. There are homemade baked good. Seriously delicious baked goods with the right ingredients---no cut corners. Gerry's Sticky Buns are sublime...more about nuts and just enough sweet to be sensational...and less about the bread. They are addictive. One Sunday I was evesdropping  and overheard a table of Cornell students raving over the sticky buns. They loved them so much that they wanted (at the end of brunch) to buy out all the rest of them to take home and savor. I was right there with them.  However, there are freshly baked cupcakes ( a new offering from Felicia) that feature flavors like Guinness Cupcake with Irish Cream Whiskey Frosting,  Mojito Cupcake,  Cappuccino Cupcake with Cinnamon Buttercream or French Toast Cupcake with Maple-Bacon Buttercream--to name a few. There is always a vegan cupcake to embrace all of us! Oh, and Cocktails!! As I mentioned, I love the Zen Mary, an almost chewable Bloody Mary made with Felicia's house infused cucumber vodka, with house made worcester, lemon juice, chipoltle sauce and local, fresh horseradish.  There are  3 Mimosas offered for choice. We love the Buttered Bourbon--delicious and not what you would expect...a rich, toned drink. And the frothy, elegant Pisco Sour to celebrate a perfect morning  awaits. If you are an Ithacan (or an honorary Ithacan), Felicia's is the place to start your Sunday with Brunch. Matter of fact, you can cruise in for lunch, have a cupcake and a coffee around three---and string it out so that around 5 you can have an evening drink and settle in for live music, spiced nuts and a full day of Felicia's hospitality! Or come for brunch and have it kick off sight seeing or Sunday chores with a celebration. Any reason is good enough for me to want to have brunch regularly with Felicia's Atomic Lounge.

Felecia's is a must-try for anyone who loves creative cocktails. We were back in town for reunion (Go Big Red!), and since some of our favorite old bars have closed, we were looking for a new place to try.  Yelp was singing the praises of this place, so we stopped in and found out why. The cocktail list is full of things you won't find at other places - tweaks on classics that take them up a notch or two, as well as true originals.  Like Manhattans?  Well, once you have their Manhattan with fig-infused bourbon, you won't want it any other way.  If you favor gin and tonics, try the Seneca Slam - the elderflower syrup (a nod to the flavors of locally-grown Riesling grapes) and grapefruit add complexity, and make it a perfect summertime drink. The staff know how to mix good cocktails, and are not only friendly but courteous (gotta be the first time I've ever used that word in connection with a bar).  On the night we were there, Felecia's was full but not over-crowded, and had a relaxed vibe, with good indie music on in the background.  As you might guess from the cocktails, it's a sophisticated (but not stuffy) place. If I still lived in Ithaca, Felecia's would be a regular stop, but since I don't, I'll make it a must-visit for any return trip.

I believe most people would agree that when I think of Felicia's, I think of the word "spank." Don't get me wrong - I think children should be encouraged, not punished. But we're not talking about children; we're talking about bars, so get on my level here. Felicia's SPANKS you in mouth with an array of delicious, original, innovative, and downright playful drinks. Whoever serves as their Grand Drink Wizard must be perpetually coming up with new spells, because the list is ever changing and your taste buds will thank you for it. Actually, your taste buds might become overly attached and you'll need a restraining order. Whoa there, little guys. Felicia's SPANKS you in your tiny eyes with an absolutely poppin' atmo. The walls are literally woven with metal. I realize that may not sound reasonable to those who have yet to frequent the place, so let me explain: the walls are literally woven with metal. Felicia's SPANKS you all over with happy servers. "Happy" is a bit of a layman's term, and I'm anything but a commoner, so forgive me whilst I reiterate: the bartenders are happy, the patrons are happy, and I was happy being there. I'm still happy as a result of having been there two months ago. Overall, Felicia's is bringing spanking back, and I love it.
Really fantastic drinks. Cozy atmosphere inside or out. Some good beers. Not an extensive wine list but adequate if you must have wine. Come here for the cocktails and great atmosphere.

Felicia's has been regaling us with delicious cocktails crafted from local ingredients - sage, mint, tomatoes, even beets. After all these years, they've finally decided to use some of those ingredients in food! The ladies at Felicia's put together a simple menu that showcases locally-grown products - from the eggs in the frittata to the veggies in the brunch bowl. Speaking of the the brunch bowl - it's now my favorite item on the menu. It's literally a bowl of black beans, butternut squash, tender diced potatoes, topped with a gently fried egg that melts an orange-golden yolk over the beans, potatoes, and squash. mmmm. You also can't go wrong with the frittata of the day - featuring seasonal veggies, local eggs, and cheese, it's served with greens and homefried potatoes. They get the potatoes right, too - diced small and gently sauteed, they taste potato-y without being burned or greasy. It wouldn't be Felicia's without a cocktail, and they have a special brunch cocktail menu to choose from, starting at noon. I tried the Breakfast Cocktail and their basic mimosa, and both were quite tasty. I hear good things about the Pisco Sour, so I plan to try that sometime. Service is good and very accommodating. I arrived once with some friends with various allergies/intolerances, including a life-threatening nut allergy. The staff came out and spoke to her about the extent of her allergy and what needed to be done in the kitchen to prevent a reaction. They more than happy to wash utensils, cookware, surfaces, etc in order to accommodate her allergy. They also were well-aware of which menu items were gluten-free and how to adjust those that weren't. LIke the bar, Felicia's brunch is just the place to go for a relaxing meal, made with care with fresh local ingredients. I will be going back!

The drinks are very good. They have a fantastic bloody Mary. However the brunch was subpar. My husband's breakfast meatloaf was really bland. Both of us had potatoes that were way undercooked. My frittata was okay. So in the future I will go elsewhere for food and will go here for fantastic cocktails.

I was totally fixated on going out for drinks and snacks on Christmas Eve - and somehow just didn't realize how many places would be closed.  A coworker had suggested I go to Felicia's because he knew they would be open.  I had never been there, though I am sorry for that now because I could have been going there for years!  When we first drove up it looked closed, but someone was outside setting some things up.  The person ran in just as we were about to call across the street to ask if they were open - but just then we saw the "Open" light turn on.  We headed in, and the awesome bartender told us that even though they didn't techinically open up for a little while, that she saw us pull up so she opened up shop a little early.  THEN, she gave us a plate of homemade Christmas cookies that she had baked herself, and they were DIVINE.   I actually didn't even know that Felicia's served food - probably why I had never gone there earlier!  We ordered a couple of pizzas that were delicious - I had one with apples and feta and walnuts, and my husband had one with potatoes and garlic and cheddar.  Just the kind of nosh that I was looking for - yum! And how fun and awesome are the drinks?  I had their special "Festivus" cocktail - which honestly I have no specific memory of what it was - all I know was that is was a house-infused not-too-sweet extremely friendly and delicious drink.  Luckily the bartender warned me that while it would go down easy that it was highly alcoholic!  Without the warning I easily could have downed three of these before realizing I was trashed.  Instead, I had just one and had a perfectly happy buzz to help get me through Christmas Eve mass! I actually lived closeby to Felicia's not too long ago - and I am so kicking myself now for not making Felicia's my neighborhood haunt.  The food, drinks, and the People (!) are all awesome. Oh, and before we left - the bartender gave us some of the cookies that she could tell were our favorites to go.  Yeah!!

A wonderful experience. Between two people, we got four drinks: The beet down (tequila, beat juice and some others) - verdict: amazing if you love tequila (which I do) The one with ginger infused whisky - verdict: very gingery, would not order again... if you are CRAZY about ginger, this is for you Carrot cake - verdict: brilliant! Fig Manhattan - verdict: brilliant! It gets crowded later, but as I was there around nine we got quick, excellent, personal service. Oh, and as per the advice of my fellow yelpers, don't get anything but a cocktail, as they do them really, really well.

My favorite bar in Ithaca. Great for birthday celebrations and meeting up with an old friend to talk about comic books. Friendly staff and they always have cider, my beverage of choice.

Today (Sunday), my lady and I tried Felicia's brunch. I have to say, it easily surpassed my expectations. I ordered the State Street Sandwich, which included local ham, cheese, bacon, and arugula, dressed with chipotle aioli, on a bun. It was absolutely delicious. I had breakfast potatoes added to the plate for a couple dollars extra, which were also good. Easily eclipsed by the sandwich, but a nice accompaniment, and was actually suggested by my waitress. Speaking of which, the wait staff was very kind and attentive. They seemed slightly nervous and unsure when providing the service, but made sure we had full cups and glasses as much as possible. I imply multiple staff because it seemed there was some crossover due to one waitress having a large table and making a deal with her coworker, which worked just fine for us. I'll definitely be back to try more breakfast dishes, and possibly check out the "adult beverages" menu, which is available after noon.
My favorite bar in Ithaca. Great for birthday celebrations and meeting up with an old friend to talk about comic books. Friendly staff and they always have cider, my beverage of choice.
The absolute tops for bars I visited in Ithaca! Friendly atmosphere;  fun, edgy bartenders;  home-grown brews and liquors;  live music on Friday;  a sassy kept boy who showed me his ass but insisted he wasn't flirting with me. Felicia's is a little quieter on Saturdays, but still worth a stop and chat/flirt with the bartenders, and the folks who are there with others will gladly strike up a short (or long!), pleasant conversation. When you go here, don't stick with your regular libation.  Some crazy lesbian has dreamed up stuff that will blow your socks off, so try one of their specialty cocktails, or you will, I promise, regret it.  I had some crazy-good drink with homemade beet syrup.

Felicia's has it going on. Went there last night (friday) what a deal! Happy hour of lychee martinis (most delicious drink ever!!!) for $4 and $2 yuengling pints, live awesome music,  great options for snacks (including yummy veggie dogs!! No one ever has that option for me!) Go Felicia's!! I will be back and I'm ready for more!

Had a great brunch here today. Tried the meatloaf and the chorizo frittata. Everything tasted awesome, except the potatoes were pretty bland. Service was super friendly though. Would definitely recommend.
It's the place to drink in Ithaca, with delicious cocktails including local ingredients. And now they serve Sunday brunch too! The breakfast meatloaf is out of this world.

This bar has the best mixed drinks in Ithaca. The lychee martinis are fantastic, and the atmosphere is very laid back. It's definitely not a gay bar, but its very gay friendly.

An alright enough place,  with a good mix of ages of people,  though I would say it's mostly mid 20's and up... Decent enough beer list,  the music does start kind of early...I'm a also a fan of their hot chocolate w Irish Creme

Only went for drinks but I couldn't really have asked for more. It's a really fun atmosphere with a bit of a diner vibe. Their infused liquors are amazing, particularly the Earl Grey infused gin. It smelled so heavenly and tasted even better. Their pumpkin martini was also amazing and smelled like fall in a cup. It was the perfect dessert drink. If it's not on the menu, certainly request the lychee martini which is made with real lychee puree. Overall, a really great place to grab drinks.

How goes the queer scene in Ithaca?  Sparse. But it has some heart and a fleck of hope. Hope equipped with a sassy cocktail glass in hand.  Get your full-bodied bourbon,  cucumber infused vodka, beet syrup beverages, vegan delectable cupcakes here.  Sadly, frittatas are only during the weekends. The portions are modest and the menu options for weekend brunch are limited but what's missing in quantity shows up in quality.  The service is attentive and sweet, willing to help you mull over decisions or even if need be, honor your wants/needs to shift tables. What?  I get particularly uncomfortable sitting in chairs or stools without backs. It can get crowded with a wait which isn't bad if you want time at the bar or being in queue outdoors. Come winter though it's too cold for outdoor waits so forget that!  I've had the breakfast bowl, the meatloaf,  even breakfast sandwich.  All win,  all go safe in my belly. One request-- how about more meat options?  Bacon? I know you have to honor the vegans, but bacon fulfills the swarthy & hipster farm to table desires. It's fact. Just consider it.

The gals who own Felicia's are really great.  It's very hip but comfortable, and the specialty drinks are to die for.  Basil martini?  Gingerita?  My only complaint is it's so small that once you get a band of any kind in there, forget the conversation.  It's keeping me and my pals away some nights.

Go here for a cocktail asap!!  The place can be a bit clique-ish because of all their regulars.  But friendly staff, cool vibe, and awesome drinks.  Seriously go get a cucumber vodka cosmopolitan and thank me later!

you're insane if you don't love felicia's. the ladies who own the bar are fantastic... the bartenders are amazing... they are extremely welcoming and i can't think of a place i'd rather be whenever i'm in town.

Felicia's makes me fantasize about owning a bar!  The gals who own the place obviously love what they do and it shows.  What I love most about Felicia's is their amazing array of specialty cocktails.  There are some standards like the lychee martini and horny ninjarita but they also have seasonal drinks that are equally delicious and sometimes include surprising ingredients (cherry tomatoes?!) The space is fun and hip but small so I only tend to come here early or on a weeknight.  A few years ago they transformed their alley into a courtyard seating area which is a great place to hang out in the summer.  Felicia's just rocks, pure & simple!

If I'm going to go out for drinks with friends, this is my most likely destination.  Felicia's is fun, and frequently packed.  The staff and service is fantastic.  The drinks are strong.  Sometimes there's live music.  The bar is dominated by graduate students and professionals, not by the local college kid scene.
Eclectic choice of cocktails, friendly staff, comfortable seats = good place to have a night cap!

Everyone had a friendly vibe and had interesting conversation with such a variety of fun cocktail-sipping intellects. The bartenders were busy but attentive and their mixology was fabulous. After checking the place out a few times I noticed something pretty cool: all types of people, yet no "types".

By far, my favorite bar in Ithaca. The cocktails are unique, many using clever infusions and fruits, herbs, etc from the owner's garden. Drunk dogs are delicious with housemade condiments and I love that fig & goat cheese pizza. The staff have always been good to me and any friends I bring along.

So, I think Felicia's at least started out as a lesbian bar, but it is more of a lounge, so I picked lounge.  Just go, they love everyone. The bartenders make great drinks and the whole crowd is always friendly.  It's fun - people of all ages, a mix of students (seems like more grad students) and townies. They seem to have a lot of events, which I always meant to  go to but never made it.  I think that the group Drinking Liberally has their Ithaca meetup here. So go out and have a great martini.

Delicious seasonal cocktails, free awesome bands on Fridays & pretty far away from Collegetown (relatively speaking - this is Ithaca, after all). What more could one ask for??
Came from out of town to see this joint.  Expectations were slightly disappointed when I went on a Saturday night, and this joint was a little empty.  But maybe that's just ithaca which is small to begin with. Westy down the street seemed more packed though.  Also, for straight ladies, don't expect loads of men because they might be into each other.  But Felicia's was a friendly joint open to everyone and good for a drink and convo with a friend.  Bartenders are great and super friendly and lots of unique cocktails are available for good prices (most if not all under 10 (average $6-7).  Decor is small dive bar style, but still clean.  It is also slightly out of the way from the main downtown area.
Great neighborhood bar/lounge.   A lot of wonderful music on Sundays over the summer, too.  Great cocktails and food.
Lychee Martini, outdoor seating. 'Nuff said?
