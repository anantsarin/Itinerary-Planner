Everything I had here was great.  I love the Loganberry milkshakes and drink.  The hot dogs were really good.  The cheeseburger was good.  The price was right.  I was not a fan of the chilli though.

I'm not a big fan of hot dogs, but Ted's is by far, the best. I think they use Sahlen's and they don't have any down here in NYC. I miss their burgers and fries, too.

My Order: Chili Dog (get it), Loganberry Milkshake, Fries Pros - Inexpensive - Yummy Cons - I think they need a ventilator, there was smoke throughout the entire restaurant. I would get it to go.

Locally famous, I think it's ok.

As a Westside native who has been going to Ted's since it was at the foot of the Peace Bridge (no Googling to find out how long ago that was), a trip to Buffalo is never complete without a lunch stop at one of the Ted's locations. Unlike many other childhood food memories, Ted's consistently meets expectations. Not many places offer charcoal grilled hot dogs. These grilled-while-you-wait, and to your preferred doneness, dogs have a great flavor that stands up to all the toppings, including the hot sauce. Fries and rings are perfectly deep fried and are served in portions large enough for most people to share. Over the years the number of my must eat at places have dwindled, but Teds remains true to its roots, and remains a guilty pleasure for this mostly healthy eating Californian.

Its buffalo food.
Its buffalo food.
I feel sorry for anyone who hasn't experienced Ted's. I have not lived in the area for many years, but I still crave the Ted's experience. Hot dogs, hamburgers, sausage grilled while you watch. Ridiculously delicious. I've lived all over the country and always try any hot dog places to try to duplicate Ted's. Always boiled, never Ted's. I don't know how they make their food so addictive, don't care.  Oh, and the Loganberry. Yes, I was just in the area, and yes, I got my Ted's fix.  Ah, Ted's....I will love you forever.
One of the places I miss most about not living in Buffalo anymore. Hands down the best hot dog on the east coast. If you travel through or to Buffalo anytime soon it is a must stop. 2 regulars and one fry please. That will get you through the line and you will be happy with your choice.

This was actually a pretty disgusting place. I got a regular chili dog and the chili was not up to par. I would advise you to just not waste your time or money here. They don't even give you free refills. Totally unimpressed.

Go, no explanation should be needed. Ted's has been a fixture forever in this area. It's not a gourmet burger or anything like that and shame on you for asking. Go to Grover's or Vizzi's to the odes to large amounts of beef. What they do here is not rocket science, flame, meat, meat, flame, now have at it. The results are predictably satisfactory and will shut up the hungry noises in your gullet. These folks added Johnny Ryan's sodas to the drink selections. Under $10 bucks for a lunch, better than anything king or clown related, yup And get a teddy bar for dessert, it's okay, I won't tell.

CHARCOAL!!!! Ted's cooks their food on the grill the old fashion way, with charcoal. It makes all the difference. If you're not privy to the wonders of a backyard BBQ on a charcoal grill, than boy you are sure missing out. Ted's is simple; get in line, (I always feel like I'm waiting for a roller coaster haha), read over the menu which is conveniently posted on the wall above the grill. Order up a dog and choose your drink.  They have loganberry on tap, another uniquely Buffalo item. Have the staff slop toppings on your meat, and go enjoy. It has a strangely cafeteria feel to it, all comfort. The food is killer. Regular dog, footlong, burger, chicken sammy, sausage, all cooked over an open flame with beautiful lumps of charcoal fueling the fire and adding the flavor. The dining area at Ted's is also pretty cool furnished with old-school fast food benches all around the inside and a nice size patio outside overlooking the scenic Niagara Falls Blvd. One of the other things I love about this place is the vinegar. They have a station dedicated to vinegar and for those who like fries, you know why. It's the red headed step child of the fry condiment community. Ted's glorifies vinegar; add it to your wax paper bag-o-fries for a life changing flavor experience. Ted's is a staple place in Buffalo. I always recommend it because it is always good. It truly is backyard BBQ in a restaurant format, comfort included. Now if you could bring your cooler with you too, I might never eat anywhere else.

I must admit - I hated this place the first time I came here. But then I later just realized that it was just all bad company. Who knew you could get turned off by a strange girl chomping on 2 footlong hotdogs and an order of fries? From then on, I made every reason to dislike Ted's like oh they just burnt the crap out of my hot dog. But you know, reflecting back, I was childish because the burned hot dog is damn good. That's what makes it good! Just watching them burn the crap out of your hotdog and cutting it with that two pronged weapon in swift motions and the hot bubbles from the casing. Yessss! Yummmm! I'm not a big fan of hot dogs to begin with cause of the mysterious meats in it so I get their all beef hotdog - probably not all beef but let's just pretend together! The only qualm I have with Ted's is that it's pretty pricey for the food you get.

Food is always well prepared, delicious hot and fresh.  Their beef hot dog is well seasoned and has a nice bite to it.   Their onion rings and fries are always nicely done-you can tell they change the deep fryer oil regularly.  The only menu item I haven't tried are their burgers--I will get to them one day.  Prices are cheap given the quality and amount of food you receive.  I wish they would open a location in the GTA.

YUMMMMMMMM! Hot Dog, Hamburgers, and Fries with salt and vinegar! I have been eating at the different locations of Ted's since I was a child. I moved from WNY in 1995 but when I would return I always attempted to get to a Ted's location. I have recently relocated to WNY and have not been disaapointed on my recent visits. Charbroiled hotdogs and hamburgers, cooked per your request. Fries are always hot though I don't care for te cheese sauce they give you for cheese fries. For me I must get the loganberyy drink which is a classic in the Buffalo area. My wife whois not from Buffalo9 thinks it taste like cough syrup...lol. Not only regular dogs but footlongs and Jumbo dogs, also Jumbo burgers.

Nom nom nom nom. Four noms. Does that make a statement about this place? This is a favorite goto-during-lunch place for me. This is the kind of place I want to go to after a hanging out at a park or after walking my cat (because I don't have a dog. But you get what I mean). I was perusing some of the reviews and it was good to see someone from California rate it but I was not in full agreement of their rating and I will make it clear shortly. This place is a step up above Wendy's (because I do believe they advertise non-frozen patty meat). And almost close to restaurant quality like Applebee's but not quite there. Ted's patty meat looks nice and fresh to me every time I walk in. Fresh being the meat looks pink and it does not have that thawed out freezer burn look if you can imagine it. I'm a native SoCal-ian and have learned to love various aspects of Buffalo. Being here for over 6 years I feel I can give a comprehensive view based on SoCal city girl who has been charmed by the people of WNY. The Cali reviewer mentioned Pinks. Eh..I say to Pinks. If you are that kind of foodie that loves the glutenous menu (too many choices for me) and you it's well deserved hollywood hype, then Pinks will stomp Ted's. There's a rich history to the place and I always consider that tends to influence people taste buds. Celebs eat there and you have way more options on how to put your hot dog together. In a hipster fashion. And truthfully, I don't care if you name the food after a celeb, I still need to know that you're putting genuine chilly in it or not. I don't get caught up in hype. I let my own taste buds judge and that is still a personal preference. Duh, right? I'm rating this place on the idea of just an ol' fashion on-the-grill burger and hot dog.  They get a two thumbs up from me plus the 4 stars. This place is one of those Buffalo Good Eats type of place. It's history originates in this area. They pride themselves using Sahlen's hot dogs a fifth generation family owned business. So yeah it's that kind of place and I say that wondering if that will influence your taste buds. When you walk into Ted's they grill the food right in front of you. I enjoy their style of customer service. You have one person taking beverage orders (get the logan berry that's indigenous to this area, if you like soda/pop), one who takes food orders (the griller), one who puts on the customizable condiments (you choose, pickles, lettuce, tomato, mustard, ketchup, and a hot sauce [not sure if that is inhouse made] and one who cashes you out. That's it. No fancy pictures on the wall of any celebs visiting to eat. Not that I've noticed but I may just go back and check. If I want a burger (1/3 size...muahaha) that day I tell the griller to cook it medium which they have done right every time. And this is where the Cali girl comes in, I tell them no bun. I am a paleo-hipster (google can explain more). Add lettuce, tomato, ketchup, mustard and onion. And I don't do cheese. And viola, a great juicy burger. Nom! For a hot dog I still have a bun. I haven't stirred completed away from bread just yet. I truthfully don't eat hot dogs except at this place and over at Mississippi Mudds down the road (again during lunch and a Buffalonian mom and pop place). I usually have relish mustard, ketchup, chopped onion. The result: a very good hot dog. I have had a chili dog. The chili was not memorable and that's where Pink's beat it out, if you ever visit Hollyweird ;) Their string fry's are good. Nothing to rave about but I can tell they clean their oil often, which always affects the taste and so the fry's come out crisp. Do I go craving this place outside of work? No. I tend to cook (not grill) burgers at home. In terms of quality, I'll take this place any day over a Burger King or McDonalds where the meat has been cooked, frozen, unthawed and then nuked. Truthfully, I've had burgers at AppleBees' and sometimes they were hit or miss being over-cooked or not juicy. I think the fact that they have to cook the burger in front of you at Ted's makes their food taste consistently good. Great place to eat with family, kids, co-worker and friends.

The all beef hotdogs are the jam! As a Buffalo native for many years. I think it's a great and have to stop by here at least once every trip to inhale a couple of dogs. There's something about charcoal broiling these suckers that makes it so much better than a regular grill. The hotsauce is the bomb too. One thing I still dont get is why would anyone put vinegar on hot french fries. Makes me want to vomit everytime I smell it!

We saw this little place as we were passing by so I looked it up on Yelp and it got great reviews so we decided to try it. We were not disappointed! The onion rings were amazing! I like my onion rings light and crispy and these were exactly like that. Also I kept reading about the loganberry so I decided I couldn't come here without trying one and again I was glad I did! It kind of reminded me of a blackberry type non-carbonated drink and since I'm not a carbonation fan this was right up my alley! The burgers and hot dogs were good and I loved how they cook them over charcoal, such a great simple idea that I have no idea why no one else does this!

I'm certain I never would have stopped by if it weren't for my coworkers being in the mood for hot dogs and frozen custard - there's an Anderson's Frozen Custard next door.  Anyway, when you walk inside the restaurant, you're immediately deposited in front of the long-ish snaking line that goes back and forth a few rows in front of the grill and the register.  Good to know they grill the hot dogs or sausages right in front of you when you order it, but the line doesn't move very fast, and you're bound to spend 10 minutes drooling over other peoples' orders before you get to put yours in. When it finally got to my turn to order, I went for an all-beef hot dog with chili, and an Italian sausage with bell peppers.  Nothing particularly special about the hot dog - beefy and filling, and the chili was pretty decent and thankfully not on the super-salty side.  The Italian sausage was pretty dry and made me wish I had another all-beef or a Polish sausage instead.

Anyone that enjoys hot dogs will absolutely love Ted's. As a newer resident of Buffalo I can say that there's just something about this place. When I visited before moving here, when asked my favorite Buffalo food experience, I named Ted's hot dog my number one pick. The simplicity of it just shows how great they are and really brings home that childhood nostalgia of cooking on the grill with the family.

When I was a kid we used to go to the location down by the Peace Bridge and the food was great. Can't say the same about this location. For the money, you get better food, service, ambiance and value at Pautlers

This place was very good. Took a little bit to get through the line, but helpful staff guided us through the process! Will definitely be back when we're up next year.

I'm not sure why I haven't seen this concept exported to other cities. It's pretty simple. You order a burger or hot dog, they grill it on a charcoal grill in front of you, ask you how to want to dress it up, and then give it to you. It's backyard grill taste year-round without having to pull the old Weber out of the garage. Toppings for burgers and hot dogs are very standard and include ketchup, mustard, relish, diced sweet onion, sweet relish, cheese, pickles chili, lettuce, tomato. I think their fries are rather good and their onion rings are super tasty. The onion rings aren't those thick ones with a lot of batter -- they are thin and crispy and crunchy. I've been going to Ted's with my family since I was a little kid. It will always have a soft spot of nostalgia for me. Plus, this place serves Loganberry, a great Buffalo tradition. It's a soft drink flavored like, well, loganberry. I've never had an actual loganberry, seen a loganberry or seen anything else ever flavored like loganberry. For a long time, I thought "Loganberry" was just a made up brand name for the flavor of this soft drink that seems to only exist in Buffalo NY. Do yourself a flavor and try the loganberry.

NEW:  When I first heard about this place, I thought that bald guy who ran the Truman Show also ran all of these places. Then I realized it was "Ted's" and not "Ed's" and now I like them a whole lot more. Their Italian sausage is good, their burgers are nice, their footlongs and regular dogs are better, and their Polish is the piece-de-resistance, whatever that means. It's good. Very good. And their chocolate milkshakes are muy excelente, if a little smallente. There's a few Ted's around and they all seem to have the similarly high standard. I would bring out of towners here. That's how good it is. It's Buffalo's "Portillos", only because it's Buffalo, there's like 10 of them instead of 100. There's also one in Arizona and believe me, it's better than any other dog you'll ever find in Arizona. Except this one Yorkshire Terrier named Greyfriars Bobby. Been coming here a lot recently because their delicious juicy yummy Polish dog really is one of the best around. Nom nom nom. This place is a definite destination for any tourists to the Buffalo area, and I recommend their 3 best menu items - the regular hot dog, the Polish, and the choc shake :) ******* old review Ted's Hot Dogs. Every city has it's "thing", and Buffalo has more than its fair share. Ted's is one of them. There is a typical Buffalonian style of hot dog, famously served at Zorba's, Abbott Hots, Hot Dog Heaven, etc... this is not it. The type of hot dog served here is an entity unto itself. They have dogs, footlong dogs, Polish and Italian sausages too... and some burgers. I heard the Onion Rings are good, but I don't get those. I'm not crazy about the fries. Their chocolate shakes are usually good, and are fairly cheap with the ridiculous price of choc shakes these days. They are pretty small though and not by any means the best you can get in the area. The dogs here are really, truly flame grilled... it's hot as hell near those grills and you can see the sparks fly. It gives the dogs a char-burned, crunchy crispy outside, they have a real snap to them more than any other dogs I've had, particularly in this area. I've never been a fan of green relish, but their red sauce is pretty good. For drink, you have to get Loganberry, because it's a local specialty. Did you know there is a Ted's in Arizona? It's true. There is a Ted's in Tempe, which is in the greater Phoenix Metro area. It's absolutely bizarre to see a little slice (or roll) of Buffalo in the middle of the desert. Very cool though. Well done Ted's. There are about 7 Ted's in WNY (estimated), and they're all almost identical, so whichever one you go to, you should be in for a pretty good meal. Nom nom nom. I'm giving it a five but if you only had 1 chance to get 1 dog in Buffalo, I'd say check out Zorba's or Abbott Hots instead. If you're in Phoenix, however, this would be the dog of choice. Let me say a few things about Buffalo. Buffalo has some of the best * food on earth. What Buffalo is famous for is Wings and snow. And Niagara Falls. And never quite winning any sports championships. But it should be famous for food in general. I'm talking cheap, local, original, unique food perfection, and tons of it. This city is an absolute foodie paradise. It has some amazing Thai, Chinese, Indian, Puerto Rican, BBQ, Polish... it has my fave Italian on earth (Michael's among many more), it has the best Chicken Souvlaki on earth (Alton's, among many more), the best Pizza on Earth (Imperial, Paulys, Bozannas, Zips, and many more), the best Wings by far (Zips and many more), the best meat sandwiches (Charlie The Butcher's and more), the best bar food, the best fish sandwich (Bailey Seafood), it's just incomparable as far as small towns go. I got very lucky when I randomly ended up living there and was able to discover all this culinary magic over time. original review Ted's is as good as it gets. Some of the most delicious hot dogs you'll ever eat. Good burgers Dirt cheap prices. Fantastic polish dogs. Luscious footlongs. Loganberry. It's all here and it's quintessential Buffalo. Mmm-mmmm. P.S. A really cute girl works here.
I'm not sure why I haven't seen this concept exported to other cities. It's pretty simple. You order a burger or hot dog, they grill it on a charcoal grill in front of you, ask you how to want to dress it up, and then give it to you. It's backyard grill taste year-round without having to pull the old Weber out of the garage. Toppings for burgers and hot dogs are very standard and include ketchup, mustard, relish, diced sweet onion, sweet relish, cheese, pickles chili, lettuce, tomato. I think their fries are rather good and their onion rings are super tasty. The onion rings aren't those thick ones with a lot of batter -- they are thin and crispy and crunchy. I've been going to Ted's with my family since I was a little kid. It will always have a soft spot of nostalgia for me. Plus, this place serves Loganberry, a great Buffalo tradition. It's a soft drink flavored like, well, loganberry. I've never had an actual loganberry, seen a loganberry or seen anything else ever flavored like loganberry. For a long time, I thought "Loganberry" was just a made up brand name for the flavor of this soft drink that seems to only exist in Buffalo NY. Do yourself a flavor and try the loganberry.
Excellent dogs
NEW:  When I first heard about this place, I thought that bald guy who ran the Truman Show also ran all of these places. Then I realized it was "Ted's" and not "Ed's" and now I like them a whole lot more. Their Italian sausage is good, their burgers are nice, their footlongs and regular dogs are better, and their Polish is the piece-de-resistance, whatever that means. It's good. Very good. And their chocolate milkshakes are muy excelente, if a little smallente. There's a few Ted's around and they all seem to have the similarly high standard. I would bring out of towners here. That's how good it is. It's Buffalo's "Portillos", only because it's Buffalo, there's like 10 of them instead of 100. There's also one in Arizona and believe me, it's better than any other dog you'll ever find in Arizona. Except this one Yorkshire Terrier named Greyfriars Bobby. Been coming here a lot recently because their delicious juicy yummy Polish dog really is one of the best around. Nom nom nom. This place is a definite destination for any tourists to the Buffalo area, and I recommend their 3 best menu items - the regular hot dog, the Polish, and the choc shake :) ******* old review Ted's Hot Dogs. Every city has it's "thing", and Buffalo has more than its fair share. Ted's is one of them. There is a typical Buffalonian style of hot dog, famously served at Zorba's, Abbott Hots, Hot Dog Heaven, etc... this is not it. The type of hot dog served here is an entity unto itself. They have dogs, footlong dogs, Polish and Italian sausages too... and some burgers. I heard the Onion Rings are good, but I don't get those. I'm not crazy about the fries. Their chocolate shakes are usually good, and are fairly cheap with the ridiculous price of choc shakes these days. They are pretty small though and not by any means the best you can get in the area. The dogs here are really, truly flame grilled... it's hot as hell near those grills and you can see the sparks fly. It gives the dogs a char-burned, crunchy crispy outside, they have a real snap to them more than any other dogs I've had, particularly in this area. I've never been a fan of green relish, but their red sauce is pretty good. For drink, you have to get Loganberry, because it's a local specialty. Did you know there is a Ted's in Arizona? It's true. There is a Ted's in Tempe, which is in the greater Phoenix Metro area. It's absolutely bizarre to see a little slice (or roll) of Buffalo in the middle of the desert. Very cool though. Well done Ted's. There are about 7 Ted's in WNY (estimated), and they're all almost identical, so whichever one you go to, you should be in for a pretty good meal. Nom nom nom. I'm giving it a five but if you only had 1 chance to get 1 dog in Buffalo, I'd say check out Zorba's or Abbott Hots instead. If you're in Phoenix, however, this would be the dog of choice. Let me say a few things about Buffalo. Buffalo has some of the best * food on earth. What Buffalo is famous for is Wings and snow. And Niagara Falls. And never quite winning any sports championships. But it should be famous for food in general. I'm talking cheap, local, original, unique food perfection, and tons of it. This city is an absolute foodie paradise. It has some amazing Thai, Chinese, Indian, Puerto Rican, BBQ, Polish... it has my fave Italian on earth (Michael's among many more), it has the best Chicken Souvlaki on earth (Alton's, among many more), the best Pizza on Earth (Imperial, Paulys, Bozannas, Zips, and many more), the best Wings by far (Zips and many more), the best meat sandwiches (Charlie The Butcher's and more), the best bar food, the best fish sandwich (Bailey Seafood), it's just incomparable as far as small towns go. I got very lucky when I randomly ended up living there and was able to discover all this culinary magic over time. original review Ted's is as good as it gets.

I loved the hotdogs.  If i would have known i should have gotten a footlong but try the onion rings you wont regret it.  I went on my lunch break and I give it five stars to try.

This isn't Pinks.  This isn't Top Dog.  This isn't U-Dog.  I was expecting a menu with more than 5 items on it but that's all there was.  It's an incredibly simple restaurant offering standard hot dogs, foot longs, all beefs, sausages, and burgers.  Toppings again were standard: ketchup, mustard, onions, sweet relish, hot sauce, and pickles.  Where's the imagination?  Once again, my bar was set too high.  My all-beef dog and fries were good though but those + drink for $8 was stadium-like prices and failed to fill me up.

What can you say about Ted's other than it is Great.  In the 4 places you have to eat in Western NY Mighty Taco, Anchor Bar, Duffs and here it is probably number 2.  Fries are solid and the dogs are world class

The best in Buffalo. We always go there when we go to Niagara. The menu consists of traditional drive in food, but try the Loganberry shake. It is excellent.
