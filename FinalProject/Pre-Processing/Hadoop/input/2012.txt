Wow, what a fantastic Valentine's Day Dinner!  We were very happy with everything. . . from the pleasant employee who took our reservations, to the hostess upon arrival, our server, Sandy, and of course the food was outstanding.  On one of the busiest nights of the year, the entire operation was flawless.  The restaurant was full, the bar was hopping, yet we were seated right on time and the service was wonderful.  We had a party of 4.  I would like to point out, each employee we came in contact with was very friendly, accommodating and I could see had pride in their work. The atmosphere was also pleasant.  The feel of the decor brought you into a traditional Irish/European establishment. Wide range of Menu selections from Seafood, steaks, chicken, upscale sandwiches and even a good ol'e Shepard's Pie. I would highly recommend!

I crave their roast beef on wek. I haven't been there for a while, but I'm heading over today after 4pm for their amazing happy hour apps. You can get their melt-in-your mouth beef on wek for like $5. The portion size is very generous. Their wings are pretty good as well. Perhaps I'll get both.

Yep.  I'm in the suburbs. That was my tip the first time I came.  Been back twice since.  Ive only been for "group meetings" where there is a fixed menu and in a private room.   It fine.  A-OK fits well.  They are good at the "group meal" thing.  I just don't love the food.  Bland.  Overcooked.  But that's often the case with group meals.  Not sure that's the places fault or the "menu choosers" fault either. reasonable parking.

Lettuce in my salad was discolored throughout. Couldn't even finish it. Ended up feeling sick later that night. Plus inside is depressing, and is in desperate need of a remodel. I will not be returning.

Still like the food here but my beef on weck wasn't 5-star on this visit. More 4-star. But still good. One thing to consider when being seated without a reservation... The bar side can be loud. Do people have no self-awareness when in public anymore?! Screaming toward a TV with lotto numbers on it for a good hour is obnoxious. I thought this older (50's) lady at the bar was watching a sports game but she was really hootin' and hollerin' over the fact that her numbers weren't coming up on the quick draw or bingo or some crap. How freaking obnoxious!!! I was surprised at how busy it was here on a Saturday night at 5:15pm. So call for a reservation if you don't want to listen to obnoxious townie bar patrons screaming over their missed lotto numbers. And also you'll sit next to windows in the bar side booths and they are COLD during the winter. Otherwise, the food was great!

Crab cakes are so good as an app! We enjoyed open face turkey sandwich, prime rib, shrimp pasta and kids chicken fingers. It was all VERY GOOD! Fantastic service, clean bathrooms. You'll never go thirsty.

Had been visiting Sean Patrick's every Monday night this past fall, after an appt. nearby. What we did was sit at the bar and order from the limited bar menu. Most often, I ordered the beef on weck (the best!) we also have gotten the other items from the bar menu. All were super good. Prices are extremely reasonable on this menu. Service was very attentive. (We were at the bar, though) I appreciated the politeness of the staff. Ladies, the stalls in the powder room are super small - not a comfortable room. Although, it was very clean. I always rate the powder room.  I figure if it is clean, the kitchen is probably clean as well. I was seriously considering having a rehearsal dinner here in the fall 2013, but after reading some of the reviews, I am definitely skeptical.

We had a surprise birthday party for my Mother's 80th birthday at Sean Patrick's. It was for a party of about 50 people. Although I wasn't in on the planning stage, I heard from various sources that the food was pretty decent (probably based on their Friday fish frys) The food we were served buffet style was awful, small pieces of previously frozen, dry, baked chicken with virtually no seasoning, some frugally served dry and tough carved beef bottom round with no flavor, overcooked vegetables, mushy commercial dinner rolls, instant mashed potatoes, some dried gravy mix and an iceberg lettuce salad with 3 or 4 bottled dressings. The best part of the meal was the cassata cake which we brought with us from Romano's Bakery on Kenmore Ave. At $40.00 bucks a head we weren't expecting a Waldorf Astoria banquet but what they served us made me long for the cafeteria lunch program at Benjamin Franklin High School. I don't understand the mentality of turning off 50 people in one foul swoop, that equates to at least 300 people that will never darken their doorstep at dinner time. I guess they saved enough money cranking out this uninspired slop to make it worth their while. Congratulations on those profits! Never again!

I've only ever been for a Friday Fish Fry, so I won't expound on the whole of the menu.  The fish is a hearty portion and comes beer-battered or breaded and is accompanied by cole slaw.  You also get a choice of fries or mac and cheese.  The wine list is short. They need to stock some Malt Vinegar for the fries.  Red Wine Vinegar just doesn't cut it, sorry. Otherwise, the parking can be an issue and they don't take reservations for less than groups of six.  The wallpaper is not pretty.  But I like it!

Sean Patrick's is overpriced and the food is beyond terrible!  We had a banquet here and we were charged $22 per head for food that was SO bad I didn't even want to return for seconds.  The best item on the menu was the dinner roll.  Yes, the dinner roll was more appetizing than the roast beef or the nasty pasta that they served us.  When you have a banquet at Sean Patrick's, you're basically paying for the banquet room, NOT the food.  I'd say the banquet room wasn't bad but I'd never come here on my own to order anything from this restaurant. My advice?  Before you book your banquet here, think long and hard about other possible options around the Buffalo area.  Unless you absolutely need to have your banquet in this area, I'd highly recommend not having the banquet here.

***This is a review of the banquet aspect I came here for a wedding a couple of weeks ago and you would never have guessed this place had such a great banquet area. All of the servers were very nice and respectful, never interrupting you to take your plate away or intruding in while you were in conversation. I thought the bartender throughout the night did a very good job handling all the drunk wedding attendants as the night progressed got very very loud and alcohol hungry (as you would expect).  I think my favorite part of the whole dinner experience was the carving station where the gentleman doing the carving had a routine of tossing his knives in the air and sharpening frequently which added to the experience. Before the wedding reception started I sat down at the bar within the restaurant and took a look at the menu and man, this place just seemed overpriced! The food and the drinks both seemed very overvalued. I'm not sure if I would ever go here for dinner, but if youre looking to have a party or a wedding reception Sean Patricks gets the thumbs up in my book

Went here for a wedding this past weekend and the place is great! The servers and bartenders are friendly and efficient, the ballroom is beautiful, and the bar connected to the banquet hall is nice and chill as well if you need something more quiet and intimate outside of the dance floor. If I was to do a large event in Buffalo such as a wedding or something of the like...this would be the place! Great building, nice service, and they took care of (the bridal party and the bride) very well! They even brought up food and drinks to us in our private bridal room upstairs. The food was also very tasty! Their mashed potatoes and salmon with this mustard like sauce were superb! Get it if you like fish and have that option! The drinks were also poured well! Thanks for the great service for my best friends wedding!

I've been to Sean Patrick's several times now, but it's always been for a banquet. So here's a review for banquets and the subsequent "let's move to the bar" experiences I've had. The banquet food is your typical, overcooked, oddly seasoned banquet hall food. Once I had this phenomenal potato soup that made me think that the rest of the meal would be great, but it wasn't. It's banquet food. Last banquet I had a piece of super thin overcooked chicken filled with some terribly overseasoned stuffing and covered in some sort of hollandaise-resembling sauce that was 30% coagulated before it was even put in front of me. Blegh. The service during the banquet was great though, and when we moved to the bar the service was equally great and the drinks were were generously poured and cheap. The atmosphere in the bar and restaurant is also better than the weirdly decorated banquet rooms, with dusty artificial plants and home-spun paintings on the walls.

We started planning an New Years Eve event through Sean Patrick's for family and friends back in August / September of 2012. At first, things were starting to come together with the coordinator, but it was difficult to meet with her face-to-face. We had agreed initially that there would be a minimum of 30 and a max of 50 people attending, which they had said was no problem. As the date rolled around, everything was booked and ready to go until 4 DAYS before when Sean Patrick's called and now said that we would need to have a minimum of 40 people in order to still have the event and that our DJ we had booked and submitted to them in the past was now "not allowed to play there". After scrambling to find more people to fill the remaining slots and try to work something out with the DJ, Sean Patrick's was not willing to budge on anything OR honor their original agreement (once again, nothing in writing since the coordinator was never available face-to-face). After trying to negotiate with them on a reduced package to salvage the party, we were forced to cancel the day before due to them allowing us to have the party at a very reduced food selection and a reduction of 25% less bar time. We decided that it was not a worthwhile value for the money they were charging. They are TERRIBLE at communication and no one there, neither the coordinator, the manager, or the owner knows what is going on at any given time. This was demonstrated by the various answers that we were given by each person. The coordinator agreed to the initial numbers, then was denied by the owner and passed on by the manager. The owner felt that he "didn't care if we came or not" since he kept the deposit anyways. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND that anyone looking for an event venue search ELSEWHERE. Any place has to be better than this place and if you do book through here, you will end up disappointed and stressed and possibly even as angry as us at having your event changed / canceled at the last minute. Or they will pull the old bait-and-switch and try to get more money out of you. As of today, 1/3/2013, all negative comments from myself and our guests on their Facebook page have been "sanitized" (removed) so that there is no record of them being on there. They tried to lie to a guest who posted a negative comment about the party about whose fault it was and that they were not responsible, and when I responded to correct them with facts, they removed the posts. What a fantastic way to lose business! STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS DISHONEST BUSINESS!

I used to be a big fan and eat there often. After a meal there yesterday, when our salad plates were taken away before we had finished in order to rush us out the door, I am not planning a return visit. While their Reubens are pretty good, I have had some pretty bad fish there and had to send it back. I wouldn't recommend using their banquet services as I mentioned that they rushed our party in and out so fast we didn't know what hit us. I guess they booked to close together but when you spend money for a banquet hall, it should be relaxing for the guests, not a race in and out.

Very little value for the money...  Earlier this evening, my wife, son and I visited Sean Patrick's.  it will be our last visit.  I ordered a chicken Caesar salad, my wife ordered an open faced melt sandwich, and a grilled cheese for my son.  My salad arrived in a luncheon sized plate, had about 2 oz of chicken, with stale, store bought croutons, and 2 slices of mushy tomato.  They had the audacity to charge $13 for this.  My sons grilled cheese had a side of about 12 fries on them.  My wife ordered an iced tea, for which she was charged $2.50, and then another $2.50 when she got a 2nd refill ( we weren't told there would be an additional charge when she asked for a refill). Some Yelpers seem to like this place, but based on our experience I'm warning everyone I know to stay away from this place.

I went to Sean Patrick's for my good-bye lunch from my last employer.  Loved the atomsphere.  Liked the food, wish I could have bellied up to the bar.   This is the kind of place I would have loved to crash to make the old folks cringe over back in the day.  I guess I'm a little old for that now - maybe even one of the old folks myself.  But I TOTALLY still want to do it.
Used to like it there til their "new menu". All they changed were the prices.  Up they went.  Sorry folks, I don't care what you do to chicken....a chicken dish is not worth $17...and that's starting price!

I had the veal marsala which is sadly done better by most of the chain restaurants. It was accompanied by mashed (cold) potatoes. I wanted to send it back but after thirty minutes sitting with it in front of me no one came to check and see if it was good or not.

More than the food, I like the atmosphere of this place.  A truly warm and cozy place with wood and fire.  The menu is diverse and leaves you with tough choices to make.  The food itself is pretty good too.

Not happy, brought the family for dinner here for a birthday. 9 of us in a group. Our waitress was inattentive and the food was sub par. My sister ordered a hamburger medium well, it came out bleeding and rare. The waitress seemed almost mad that she had asked to have it sent back. We had to ask for refills on our drinks, I was sick for the next 24 hours after my dinner, my brother ate overdone pork chops. I expected a much better experience. And when we paid the bill, she never brought our change back, we had to ask for it because she assumed the change was her tip. Not sure when that became acceptable. the place was dead besides our group and therefore there was no reason for the lack of attention. Just expected much more from this place.

Good standard Irish dishes.  Excellent fish fry in Fridays... Veal Marsala was good, a little heavy on the sauce... Great service!  The stuffed hot peppers are a must...

I went to a baby shower here today, and I was pleasantly surprised.  I have never been here before, but I thought the buffet food for the shower was pretty tasty.  First off, the setting was actually really beautiful.  The room we were in was really classy looking, and I thought it was perfect for the event.  First we got a salad, which was just iceburg lettuce, but the dressing was left on the table, which I appreciated because often I find at events that salads either have too much dressing or not enough. There were rolls as well, with delicious whipped butter to go with.  The actual food was pretty good; there was green beans almondine, ziti, delicious potatoes, which were the highlight, and carved turkey and roast beef.  The waitstaff were also great at keeping all the beverages filled, and our shower went way past the time expected and we weren't hurried at all.  I would go back, especially because the rest of the bar and restaurant looked pretty fun.

Atmosphere is very nice.  We had pub food and sandwiches which is on par with other places.  They claim that they would put their Beef on Weck up against anyone's.  We think McPartlans has a much better sandwich. It is close to our home and we will come again to try their entrees.

If you crave some home cooking, you can't beat Sean Patricks. They raised the prices a little while back so a little overpriced. We go every St. Patrick's Day, today was one of the best meals I've had in a while there. They need to make the Reuben soup a permanent menu item...it was out of this world! I almost always get the Shepard's Pie, but the other items I have had there have been wonderful.

Came Here on a Friday night with my family.  Parking was an issue the night we came because there must have been a wedding going on, but we made up our own spot and everything was ok! While it was still pretty crowded in the dining room and bar we didn't have to wait at all for a table inside, outdoor seating is available also.  Our server was a very serious all business kind of guy, and was very attentive and polite.  The bread before dinner was fresh and warm.  For my meal I had a Grilled Salmon Salad which was excellent!  The dressing it came with was some kind of honey mustand and was very good.  Everybody else had a beer battered fish fry for $11, which I heard was also delicious, it came with macaroni salad or fries.

I went to Buffalo for the first time to meet my boyfriend's family. He grew up there and he made it a goal for us to eat at all of the most popular and top restaurants while we were in town. Sean Patrick's was definitely my favorite!! Everyone who worked there was so friendly,  the atmosphere and decor were great, and the food was amazing! We ordered a lot of different things.  For appetizers we had the potato soup, which was the best i've ever had and the banana peppers which were my favorite out of all the other restaurants' banana peppers in Buffalo. My boyfriend ordered the tenderloin sandwich and I had a steak, both of which were delicious! After our meal, we walked back to see the banquet room and it was gorgeous! If I lived in Buffalo I would definitely get the banquet room for an event or party. Basically I just loved Sean Patrick's and the next time we visit Buffalo that will be the first place we eat :)
