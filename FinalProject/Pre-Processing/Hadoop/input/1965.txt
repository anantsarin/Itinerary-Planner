I've been to quite a few Barnes and Noble's, and I have to say that this is one of my favorites. There are so many places to hole away and peruse a good book with the scent of Starbucks wafting all around. This store is kept well-stocked, very clean, and organized. The help is friendly and actually helpful, which is always nice. :) While this isn't really the place for bargain book or music shopping, it is the best place to just hang out and chill for awhile. They do have a "bargain priced" section, and I have found a few good deals there as well. But I mostly like this store for the environment. I've purchased books here for more money than elsewhere simply because I love to spend time in the store. Also, they have a savings club for educators that, as a teacher, I enjoy taking advantage of. :) Go B&N!!

Barnes & Noble.. My home away from home.. Coffee: they have a huge Starbucks Cafe with 20 plus cafe and group tables.   The books: oodles and oodles of fun thing to read and they did a good job organizing the massive amounts of reading materials. I find this B&N quite comforting compared to ones I've been in Manhattan. Children's section: Just amazing, the kiddo is a big fan of Thomas and Friends they this location has Kids reading time in the mornings, added plus a huge place set with many wooden Thomas and Friends trains (Big Plus) The Huge two floor B&N which also happens to be right across from the IBM campus is quite interesting. The mall also includes Toys R Us which makes it a fun place to just wander around and enjoy many shopping experiences, I did my usual enjoy a nice paper, drink a good cup of Joe and entertain the kids all in one location. You just can't beat that. The store opens at 9 to 11 weekdays (Awesome) The Staff are all professional, friendly and knowledgeable about the books and contents they have in the store which is a big Plus.. I'm a Fan!

This place is HUGE and I'm pretty sure you can find something inside that you really want. From a large cafe to music area, to two floors of books upon books upon books, this B&N is a reader's absolute heaven. I find myself here oftentimes over the weekend spending a few hours in one of the many tucked away isles. Since it's open until 11pm, it can be easy to loose track of your time. I've never had any trouble finding things with the help of the friendly staff. They also work hard to keep the store extremely clean and well-managed. From sidewalk sales to new releases, I find that the store is pretty up-to-date on a lot of things. There's a little sumthin-sumthin for everyone here!

I found out something interesting the B&N online is not affiliated with the actual store. I placed an order online that was to be given as Christmas gifts early in November. Come mid December I realized the order had not been received. I called the customer service number who than told me that a particular book that I had ordered was not released yet..shipping bundles yours orders..it would not be delivered till Jan 7th. WHAT?? All of the other books were available..why not send those! So I cancelled the order with no promise that it could be cancelled !! What a disaster..you lost my online business. However I love the B&N actual store, nothing better than browsing for hours at all the dreamy books!

I spent a few hours perusing some books on Farmhouses (for my planned reno). People watching is far more intriging at B&N...one never knows who may be lurking about. The staff refer to the computer for most questions...I do love a good old fangled book store where the clerk is the encyclopedia of all knowledge of books~~~ Selection? Pretty extensive. Price is almost always at the top of the range unless you are opting for 'clearance' reads...and now with kindle, ipad and nook---who knows where the mighty B&N will go ? ? ? B&N is most helpful in allocating difficult to find reads...so I do give **** for that... I looove the kiddie section and enjoy seeing the kids who are evolving into readers~~~readers experience much more adventure in their lives !

I always prefer to start with independent bookstores and game stores. But I must give credit where credit is due. This Barnes & Noble does a really good job of staying current and relevant. They devote space to what they know people want, whether it be Nook sales, the Cafe, music, and now a really good assortment of games - and they have the space to make all these changes.  If I want something immediately, and I don't want to wait for it to be shipped, or to drive someplace a little less accessible, I'll typically buy it here. I've spent my time noshing in the cafe, browsing the magazines, listening to CDs on the display wall, etc.  If people consider industrial-strength bookstore chains to be evil, I guess we have to call this Barnes & Noble a necessary evil.

Grandchildren love it and if it makes them happy, it does the same for me.

There are few lazy day activities I enjoy more than going to B&N, accumulating a stack of books and plopping down on one of their comfy chairs to spend a few hours decompressing. I can go anywhere and do anything! And with a nice hot cuppa in hand, it is all good things!

There really isn't nothing  to complain about the store itself since I make most of my purchases on their online site.  It more about those who sit at the snack bar for long period of time doing nothing but taking up space. Don't these people have a job or a life? Your suppose to go out  and do things not go out just so you can go on your labtop for a few hours!!! If your looking to find a table to sit down to eat and chat with a friend you won't find any. That seems to be the problem with places that have free WiFi because your gonna have more people just sitting there not provided the store with any business just parasites sucking up the free wifi.

This is one of the best B&N locations I've ever been to.  It rivals even those in Manhattan. The staff is always friendly, the tables are available for sitting and the atmosphere is very relaxed.
