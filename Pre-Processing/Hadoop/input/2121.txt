Used the drive thru at this location. there was only one car in the lot and no one in front of me in the drive thru; however, i waited a few minutes before anyone welcomed me and asked to take my order. when someone finally came on the other end it sounded like i had ruined their day by driving up. thankfully the person who took my order didn't deliver at the next window. the food was hot, fresh and as ordered, that was great. everyone deserves to have a bad day so i wont hold that against them
If I could give this place 10 stars I would. If you live in Jamestown NY this place has been an institution, a way of life, even a religion to some since 1929. They serve the best burgers and dogs I have ever had in my life and whenever I go to visit the fam I go to get my fix and am never disappointed. Hell I have been going there since I was 5 years old and haven't been disappointed. I even recognize some of the employees working there from when I was a kid. Ok, about the food. The burgers are small but cheap and they are served covered with this delicious beef gravy with onions and awesome spices and mustard. The dogs come the same way and the fries are great in the sauce as well. I wish I could go eat there right now, f'reals!!
Three stink dogs with fries and a MALTED chocolate shake - STAT! This place as well a Johnny's Lunch are Chautauqua County staples. Find time for these some day if you're traveling through. Don't forget to roll your windows down or eat in a well ventilated area... they tend to make you smell... smell like AWESOME.
Driving through Jamestown, we thought, let's 'Yelp' for lunch. Ohh, this place has five stars.... Oh well. The food was just bad. A small piece of bland salty hot dog covered in, drenched in, gravy and onions. Several of us had stomach aches afterwards. The one nice thing I can say is that everyone working there was very nice. They even gave me a candy cane when i starred at it for too long. It pains me to give them a bad review, but I feel other Yelpers need to know this place isn't a greasy spoon mecca; its just a greasy spoon.
Well, I think you have to have grown up on these to post one of the glowing, orgiastic  reviews for this place.    Theres something powerful about food, memory and sense of place, so Ill give it that. Had two of the dogs with everything and a very tasty malted peanut butter shake. The "Texas Hots" are small'ish, so I ordered two on the rec of the counter person (you can get 3 for 3.12 to go) and the shake.   Buns are steamed and the dog is covered with a mixed chili/beef gravy sort of sauce. The shake was very good.  A tad thinner than I like,, but strong peanut butter flavor and a generous-sized cup for $3 bucks.   Didnt taste the malt, but the PB was strong. Overall,  it was enjoyable for what it was, but I wouldnt necessarily go out of my way again. That being said, the drive thru had 5 cars lined up and there were about 8 high school baseball players inside chomping down. I love that little local places like this continue to thrive in a society that keeps getting more bland each year. Keep rockn' it AJ's and keep loving 'em Jamestowners ....its your little local spot.
If you're looking for a local staple, this is one of them. Best cheap food you can buy. I always get the hotdogs with light sauce (otherwise you cant eat them while you drive) ketchup, and mustard. Days I am more daring I'll include onions. So so good!
AJ's hot dogs are the only ones I really like because they don't have a really strong flavor like the kind you buy in grocery stores.  The sauce is alright, but I prefer my hot dogs plain.  My parents love the sauce, so it's just me.  My boyfriend really enjoyed it too.  The french fries aren't bad.  I haven't ever had anything but hot dogs and fries here.  The staff is very friendly and you get your food quickly. I like that they tenderize the hot dogs and the buns are steamed so they're soft.
Jamestown is known for their different Texas Hots, but I have to say that AJ's has been consistently good for my entire life. I have some good memories of having a half day when I was at Jefferson MS up the hill, coming down here with friends for lunch before our moms could take their lunch break to come pick us up. Also, AJ's the first place I ever had (or ever got to have) loganberry pop! You can't beat the takeout deal of 3 dogs or burgers.They were just as I remembered them.  For the uninitiated, they might be a little much to eat and run, but if you have an empty stomach, you are set. I am not much of a hot dog person, so I always get the burgers and they are tender and tasty. They even hold up well after a 1hr+ car ride and a little heating up in the microwave!  I picked up some onion rings and ate in car and they were good. Be daring and get the Texas Fries! Love that the inside hasn't changed either. While they did have to take down the old sign for safety reasons, I liked that it was featured on the back of the worker's shirts. No, this isn't fine dining, but is a nostalgic part of Jamestown. I'll be back, AJ's!
FOOD: The food here is very tasty and is a local favorite.  My partner requests "easy on the mustard" with their popular Texas Hots hotdog and they still put quite a bit on.  If you're ever in the area, definitely try their Texas Hots hotdogs.  Very good! SERVICE: They are friendly and the service is fast. CLEANLINESS: The place is pretty clean.  Not sure about their restrooms since I've never used them. ATMOSPHERE: Feels like an old style burger joint, but instead mainly serves hotdogs.  The place has big glass windows in the front and 2 doors on each side with a walk up counter in the middle.  There are about 4 to 6 tables in front of the service counter. OTHER NOTES: This place has a drive thru.  They have 4 parking spaces in front of the building.
Best chili-cheese spot in the area! Everything is delicious, and cooked to order. They don't balk as special orders either (chili cheese burger with no bun, for example). I'm always satisfied with my visits to AJs!
As a hot dog lover and aficionado this place is one of the best in the area, not as good as Johnny's, a local institution to which I awarded Five Stars, but serves a great Texas Style dog at an incredible value price of $2.98 for three take outs.

Dang, this place makes my mouth water.  I need some AJ Texas Hots - Hot Dog that is!!  They have Fantastic gravy-styled hot dogs!  Gravy is an understatement; it's more like a thin chili sauce.  Tastes great!

My favorite lunch spot. If you want a hot dog, burger or fries skip the chain restaurants and go here. Oh and don't forget the sauce.
