My fiance bought my engagement ring from the Diamond Mine last summer. The ring is absolutely gorgeous and the compliments from even complete strangers are endless! I went with my fiance to the store because the ring was too big and the guys were super helpful. I had the ring back quickly and it fits great. I've been back a few times to buy  earrings and to get some jewelry cleaned. I am recommending the Diamond Mine because I've had such good experiences every time I walked in the door.
I was shopping around, trying to sell or trade in my gold and buy wedding rings. Out of all the jewlery stores I went to the man who "helped," us was the most rude and condescending person I dealt with. He stood there chatting with soneone while we waited and helped another customer before us, despite us being there first. When he looked through my gold, he didn't test anything. I had it tested for karat at multiple places, he just guessed at it. He said some wasn't worth anything, ( that was 14 karat) and offered us cash for some that tested as mostly metal. Clearly didn't care and didn't know what he was doing by sight alone. He then gave us the lowest offer $400 cash/$500 trade in for over $1000 worth of gold (at 70% of value.) My soon to be husband was debating between platinum or a cheap titanium ring. He works doing manual labor and isn't sure he wants to spend the extra $ for platinum. The salesman was rude and unhelpful about this too. So my advice to anyone shopping here is to dress up very nicely if you want this guy to take you seriously. I was dressed for the gym and my fiance was out cutting the lawn. I guess if you don't appear to have money, you must not. This salesman lost out on the commision for two platnum bands, as we purchased them elsewhere. We shop with people who are polite and helpful.
I have had such a great experience every time I've been to the Diamond Mine. Jeff & Rob have a great jewelry store with lots to choose from and If they don't have it they will get it for you. They have been patient, helpful and informative every time i've been there. I recently got married and did a lot of shopping around and researching and The Diamond Mine couldn't be beat, with quality, pricing,selections and just all around great customer service. If you don't believe me all I can say is go in and see for yourself. Whether your dealing with Jeff or Rob you won't be disappointed, It's hard to find a business that truly stand behind their products now a days and this is one of them. Thanks for everything my wife and I love our rings and she constantly gets compliments on them.
Have you ever wanted a friend "in the business"? The reason I started going to the Diamond Mine a little over 15 years ago was because, quite frankly, I was sick and tired of the so called "professional" jewelers in the mall who hire twenty year old know nothings to run their cases and throw out sales pitches. Guess who you deal with when you go to the Diamond Mine? Rob, or Jeff. They're the owners. If you've been there, you've met them. Nobody else runs their shop, not even during the mayhem holiday season. Got a problem? Guess who you're going to talk to to fix it... the owner. Oh, and there's also Frank. Frank is their franchise jeweler who does all their repairs on site and in full view of the clientele. Guess how I know Frank. That's right... he's the only person who ever touched my jewelry. No out-of-house repairs or cleanings. And that's all there is to it. I know these guys... not because they're my friends, but because they're my jewelers. So now I can say I know a guy (or three). The only bad thing I can say about this place is that I had to give it up when I moved to MA a few years back. Luckily I still have family in the area, and I can stop in during the holidays. Last minute holiday shopping is never a problem with these guys. They're always stocked, and are fully connected with the Diamond District in NYC for any out of the ordinary requests you can't find locally. Bottom line... go here. Make friends. Build a relationship with these guys. They'll remember your name. They'll remember you and appreciate you. They'll do the little things for free, just as a thank you for your business because they know you're a loyal customer. In terms of the jewelry... listen: I'm a man. I don't wear a ton of jewelry and I don't always know what my wife likes. These guys have never steered me wrong and my wife adores everything she's ever bought or received from here. That's another reason to shop there... they will help you out if you're a dummy like me. There's no B.S. No sales pitches. Your woman will not be disappointed. Final note: I had a minute to stop in here this past Christmas. They moved. They're nearer to the Poughkeepsie Galleria, now. Holy hell, what a store. Gorgeous. These guys are doing something right, otherwise they'd still be stuck in the Dutchess Plaza next to the Dunkin Donuts.
The nicest very professional men own the store and they have a skilled repair person on site who is also friendly and talented. This shop is a wonderful place to browse and buy. If you cant find just the perfect piece of jewelry they will bring back more choices for you to look at from the City. It is my favorite jewelry store that is for sure!  Jeff and Rob go out of their way to make you a happy customer.... sometimes really far out of their way!  If you havent been there  yet....  GO.
Can't say enough great things about Jeff and Rob. Very very good products. A pleasure to do business with.
Just got through another xmas with the help of Jeff and Rob.  I've bought jewelry for years from them and my wife and I are always happy with the product and the SERVICE!!  It's nice having an owner always there and they have a full repair shop on site.  Hey Jeff and Rob, if you're reading this, Thanks again!
