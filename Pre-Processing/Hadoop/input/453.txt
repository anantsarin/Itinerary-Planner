We had a great experience here on a Saturday night with my nephew. He had a ton of fun for $5.50 and two hours of bounce time. There were not many people here but the kids that were, were very polite. The staff members were great and super nice. Just bring socks (parents included) so you don't have to pay the $2 for socks. Had a great time!
