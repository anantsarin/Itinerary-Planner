Best wings around. Get the "chicken fried" and you won't be disappointed. The beer is cold and service is usually good.
Love the pizza Tuesday special a 16 inch pie and get a 12 inch free.. fresh dough..yummy
Best pizza in town. Thurs wing nights. Lots of TVs for sports.  Good salads and fish fry.
5/5/14 update - Great food, drinks and atmosphere.  Usually lots of wait staff although some seem to be more interested in their acquaintances than doing their job.  Assume management weeds them out over time. Continues to be one of main go to spots when in town.
New to the area. Good atmosphere, good service. Three of our group had burgers. Everyone was very happy. Excellent was used several times. I thought I am in the south I'll try the. Fried chicken sandwich. I found it to be dry and tasteless. Oh well.
I love this place!   My new sports day hang out!  Great food, good staff and fun!!!!
Always have a good time at Emil's!
OK....so I am from the Philadelphia area, South Jersey actually and when you try and sell me a Philly Cheese Steak.....it better be good!!!! Emil's wasn't good,,,,,it was GREAT!!!! If the rest of the menu pans out as well as the cheese steak.....and I will find out....then this place hidden away on Sandhill Blvd is a Diamond in the rough!!!! oops...and the staff is very friendly and nice!!
Food is great, service is better. Friday fish is incredible.
