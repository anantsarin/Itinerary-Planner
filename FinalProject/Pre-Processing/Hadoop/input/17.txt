Gravy fries+carlsburgs+naked female+player light smokes=priceless
Strip clubs are more very rare entertainment than anything else (bachelor party duties and such) or when my wife wants to get rid of me and encourages me to do something with the boys.  I grudgingly oblige, but then I get there and wonder why I didn't want to go in the first place.  I'm getting too old. Actually, I would prioritize the previous posters' highlights differently: naked women + Carlsburgs . . . I leave the cigarettes to those with a death wish, and the poutine (gravy fries) to the Canadians. For adult entertainment, the Canadians have it good.  The women are able to celebrate onstage in birthday attire, they look very attractive, and its fine.
