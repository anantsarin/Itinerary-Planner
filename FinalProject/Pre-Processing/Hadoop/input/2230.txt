My spouse and I decided to try this place out because it won an award for "Best Breakfast" in one of the local newspapers, as voted on by readers.  It's great that they have a legion of regulars who show loyalty, but as a couple of first-timers it was hard to see the appeal. I had the seemingly popular sausage gravy over home fries and a corn muffin.  It was pretty good.  My spouse, on the other hand, ordered the french toast which she regretted.  It was 3 skimpy pieces of dissolvable white bread dipped in a simple egg batter, no different than what a person could make at home in 10 minutes.   The prices are very low.  We had the aforementioned food, plus a side of bacon and two coffees for a total of $16. Of course, the downside to cheap food is that the restaurant has to make up for their costs somewhere!  In this case, it was cheap ingredients and short staffing.  Aside from the dishwasher that I could hear working fastidiously in the background, the three visible employees struggled to help the 30 or so customers. I'm no Mr. Pink from Reservoir Dogs who believes that coffees need to be refilled six times, but the server didn't even offer to refill ours once.  In fact, she never checked in after the food was delivered. Eventually we gave up on that endeavor and approached the counter to pay, where we waited for a couple minutes before the frustrated cook rang us out (impressively juggling a couple tickets on the griddle while he did so).  It's a bad sign when the person in charge of food prep needs to double as a front-of-house employee. While I realize that the Lincoln Street Diner doesn't aspire to be more than a greasy spoon, our experience was far from comfortable.  I'd be perfectly willing to shell out a few more dollars for a little bit of care in service and quality in food.
Good blueberry pancakes but terrible coffee. I know that this is a locals only place but it would have been great if they made it very clear somehow that you could only tip in cash. Thankfully I had enough cash to tip after I paid with my card but I would have felt terrible if I didn't have cash.
I can't believe I have gone to school in Ithaca for 3 years and this is my first time here. This place is a gem! I had the cornbread and home fries with gravy and my mom had a single (large) blueberry pancake with 2 eggs. I had never had cornbread and sausage gravy before, so that was a new and delicious experience. Sweeter than biscuits and gravy. The pancakes and eggs were what you would expect from a classic dinner. The atmosphere is friendly and clearly a local hangout. The staff knew half the customers names, which is really nice. The restaurant is pretty small, but that defiantly adds the the very personal experience. The food came out so fast! Like the same amount of time it takes to make a pancake the food was out. And the place was full! Finally, you can not beat the price. We spent $11.45 on the whole breakfast. A great price for a great meal. I will be back!
Let's set the scene: you are walking around Ithaca way early in the morning because reasons, and you want food. Your expectations are lowered but that's okay. This is a viable option, at least until you reevaluate your life and the reasons you end up stumbling around freakin' Ithaca like that.
So this is a small older décor diner. It is fair quality but a little out of date. I ordered the veggie omelette and wanted egg beaters or egg white substituted, they offered neither. Asked for "Dry" wheat toast, it got buttered but they promptly replaced it. Went to pay and I was unaware there was a $10 min credit card requirement, after getting the boss, they ok'd it. Tips only in cash! OK.. if I had cash I wouldn't have had to use my credit card, I was in town for work and don't carry cash usually.
After reading how highly rated this place was on Yelp I had to try it out so after being in Ithaca for a year now I decided it was time.....time to have a Saturday morning breakfast at Lincoln Street. (if your asking me why breakfast is important then you obviously are not someone who loves food because breakfast.....is the best meal!) Anyways this place is small, crowded and has all the markings of a run down diner. The only problem is that it's packed! Now this is a good thing, this means it must be good so we went in and grabbed a table. The waiter came right over and was extremely nice, took our drink order and in a timely fashion was back with them and was taking our orders for food. Our food came out about 15-20 mins later, right when I would expect it to. I ordered the Cajun Sausage Gravy as most of the reviewers on Yelp RAVE about it. So I thought I'd give it a go and boy....was I amazed. This is quite possibly the best...BEST! sausage gravy and biscuits I have EVER had. The flavors were phenomenal! It was spicy, but not enough to hide the flavors. I tasted the sausage, the cream, the pepper, the cajun seasoning and the spice all together. The biscuits were soft but held their own when grabbing them with my fork. I downed the entire place in under 2 minutes and wanted more! MORE! Never in my life have I ever loved a breakfast like this before. If you are looking for the perfect breakfast spot hit this place on a Saturday morning when they have their gravy on the menu and get yourself some! You will not regret and will be hooked coming back every Saturday for that meal you can't get anywhere else! This is definitely a gem of Ithaca and I am surprised that they haven't expanded or opened for dinner because by george they could be huge! Also, not a caveat but they only take cash for orders under $10 which might not be a big deal...except their prices are CHEAP! This is a good thing though haha!

Cheap yes, so just go with that thought and you'll be happy.  I visited on a Tuesday morning, the cook, maybe manager commented a few times to various folks that they were slammed.  There was no wait but certainly a steady stream of folks. The servers were friendly and attentive. I really wanted to try the sausage gravy n biscuits.  Today's special was sausage gravy over a corn muffin and potatoes.  Weird, maybe it was a no biscuit day? I acquiesced, it was a good consistency,  good amount of sausage and a good sized plate of food.  I'd happily pay a few more dollars for crisp tatoes,  a biscuit, some seasoning (other than salt) in the gravy (after the photo I added a fair amount of pepper and some ketchup and some red hot). The potatoes on the grill top were occasionally blessed with bacon drippings, and they had a paprika hue but the soft nubs still lacked flavor.

This place is your classic dinner cuisine with a lot of neighborhood spirit.  Haute cuisine?  Try someplace else.  Want someplace that corrals you in and then puts on a show where the audience is the entertainment, too?  This is your place.  Now granted, the beau and I were there for the main waitress' (weekends only?) last day so the show may or may not go on.  So why 4 stars?  The waitress.  Seriously.  It was all the waitress.  If you want to go out and be entertained, come here.  Otherwise, I'll be making some Aunt Jemima pancakes at home and get that same reminder of what my parents used to make me as a kid.

Lots of delicious food for a good price! The staff is very friendly as well and it is right next to Ithaca Falls.

It's because of this place that I now always try to do my laundry on Saturday mornings at Fall Creek Laundromat because I can just go next door and get a great breakfast while waiting for my clothes to wash. They are famous for their Saturday morning special, the Cajun sausage gravy over biscuits. Simply put, it lives up to the hype. You get some cheddar biscuits and some potatoes, completely smothered with their amazing gravy with chunks of sausages mixed into it. It's a bit spicy but not overwhelming. Shameless individuals would probably lick their plates clean. Not only that, but it comes out to around $6. The earlier you get there, the better. I once tried going in around 1 and the place was packed with a short line, which would have prevented me from being seated before the place closed at 2. I heard they run out of certain items by then anyway. I always go around 9-10 though and seating is easy then. The staff is very familiar with the local neighbors and you'll see them joke around with those people a lot. They're pretty nice and attentive to all the other guests as well so you'll have an enjoyable experience here with them.

Great good, fair price, friendly staff. My family all did breakfast-y stuff - pancakes, omelet, etc...the venue is nothing impressive, but killer "greasy spoon" joint.

I didn't know diners this classic actually existed outside of the movies. Standard diner fare, but done exactly right.

Thr home fries and corn muffin covered with sausage gravy was delicious. The pancakes and the inlets were also very good.

Lincoln Street Diner is certainly the best diner in Ithaca. It is a bit hard to find, and the parking lot behind it should have a sign recommending several inches of ground clearance. It also isn't that big, so you should plan on waiting a little to get a booth. Finally, its a fairly local spot, so don't expect to run into all your friends from college while you're there (although if you do, that means you have really cool friends). The food is great and inexpensive. Bacon egg and cheese on an english muffin is actually made with real everything and just tastes really good. Same with omelets. The special sausage gravy is definitely worth it. it. In sum, they make diner food like it used to be made, not just sourced from Sysco. Its definitely a place worth patronizing.
Great good, fair price, friendly staff. My family all did breakfast-y stuff - pancakes, omelet, etc...the venue is nothing impressive, but killer "greasy spoon" joint.
In my mind, there are two type of diners.  There are greek diners, which are large, sparkling and have massive menus. Then there are greasy spoons, which are essentially the opposite but strangely charming because of it.  I have always been partial to a good greasy spoon, and the Lincoln Street Diner is the best I've ever been to. As an undergraduate at Cornell, the Lincoln Street Diner was my refuge when I needed to escape academia and be around normal people for a little while.   I became a regular at the Lincoln Street Diner not only because the diner is run by a great group of people and because it is cheap but also because the food is damn good.  Expect standard diner fare and you will be pleasantly surprised.  They do staples superbly  (Friday Fish Fry, Meatloaf, etc.) but the owner Chris can also get creative with the lunch specials and offer some very interesting, tasty dishes (be sure to keep an eye out for his stuffed burgers).   For lunch, my recommendation is to go with whatever is on special and be sure to get a soup.  You can get a soup in lieu of a side which can make for a cheaper and healthier meal. If you go on a Saturday for breakfast, expect a bit of a wait as it will be packed. In sum, there will always be a soft spot in my heart for the Lincoln Street Diner. It is  the Cheers of diners.  (There is even a mailman that is a regular: #CliffClavin.)  My only regret is that I didn't find it sooner in my time at Cornell.

Lincoln Street Diner is a local joint.  When we walked in, the only open tables were covered in dirty plates so we stood there looking around the place.  There were 3 tables open but they were dirty.  An obvious regular said "You better sit down before them seats get taken by someone else..." I loved it- what a riot. We sat down at the least dirtiest table and then the waitress came over and cleaned it up.  (That's the way it works, once you sit down, the mess gets cleaned up, and you are offered coffee).   Food was alright- nothing special for me (a vegetarian doesn't go far here) but it was very well priced and delicious all the same.  I had two poached eggs, wheat toast (covered in butter, yum, but if you don't want butter you must tell them in advance), and hash browns.   After (or before) a meal here, go around the corner for some sick waterfall viewing!  (There are two short walks just a few blocks from the place) one up Ithaca Falls, the other up Cascadilla trail

This is my No. 1 favorite place to grab breakfast in Ithaca.  For $4 you get coffee, toast, two eggs, and hash browns.   For only a few dollars more you can order something called MAMAS WRAPPED IN BABIES, which is an omelette with diced buffalo chicken inside of it.   If you are an ultra glutton for punishment and you go early enough on a Saturday you can get your Mamas Wrapped in Babies SMOTHERED IN CAJUN SAUSAGE GRAVY.  Oooooh it's spicy!  Additionally, the waitstaff team on Saturday is especially welcoming and funny :) This is not the place for you if if you need a place to be pristine.  This is not the place for you if smelling like a diner for the rest of the day is going to ruin your day.  This is not the place for you if you are allergic to bacon.   Protip- They are closed on Sundays.

There is an unfortunate reality in the truth that places like this are on the decline. Support this place! From the music (circa 1920's through 40's jazz) to the conversations I'm overhearing as I write this, everything here simply works. The food is simple, standard diner fare, served with a kind of dedication to the craft often overlooked when the average is $10 or less for a meal. Great people, great food. I'm leaving Ithaca once again with a full belly and heart.

Small hole in the wall diner.  Don't let the looks turn you away.  Will be very busy at peak breakfast times, so keep that in mind.  I had a great blueberry pancake - fresh blueberries.  My husband had a cheese omelet that was very good (almost as good as mine, he said, and THAT says a lot 'cause I make a great omelet).  I do have to agree with one reviewer who said the homefries lacked a lot of flavor, but salt did the trick! We also enjoyed the snarky friendly banter between the waitress and a few "regulars".  Will definitely return on our trips to Ithaca.

This place is great and this is coming from someone that doesnt usually like breakfast food.  The epitome of the greasy spoon diner. Staff is super friendly and fun.  Even when its busy you wont have to wait long for service/food.  The place is small enough to see your meal being cooked from anywhere in the dining area. Places like this are a dying breed.

A nice, quirky neighborhood place.  We had a very good breakfast, of which the blueberry pancakes were the star.  They refill your coffee endlessly without your having to ask!  The server was snappy and sardonic in the best possible sense.  All in all, a place we would visit again.

I once walked four miles so that I could get a buffalo chicken omelet. I once raced another person there when I got a phone call that a friend of ours had just ordered the last of the sausage gravy for the day and wasn't going to be able to finish it. I've come back to visit after years away and they still know as soon as I walk in the door that I want the "mamas wrapped in the babies" and a hangover-size water. I moved away from Ithaca years ago, and I literally miss Lincoln Street every single Saturday morning when I wake up and find that I'm not within an hour's drive of it. That's all I have to say.

This small little diner made a big impression on us today! We came about midmorning on a Saturday and were lucky to get a table. When we mentioned that it was our first time, the waitress offered to introduce us to everyone. We declined, but it definitely added to the "Cheers of diners" kind atmosphere. When my BIL ordered white toast, the waitress, in a friendly, motherly tone said, "Are you sure? Because whole wheat is better for you and rye doesn't taste like cardboard, I promise." My husband had a great plate of sausage gravy, biscuits and homefries, the kids split pancakes and eggs, I had french toast (very much like what I make at home...in a good way), and BIL had an omlet. The service was fast (which we love with 2 young kids in tow) and the food was great. We'll definitely be back!

Yikes, this place was not good! I went after reading all the raving Yelp Reviews. The restaurant was dirty, the tables were sticky, the floor looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a while.  This place was not sanitary!   The food was average, nothing to rave about.  They also messed up my order (pancakes when i ordered blueberry pancakes).   When we went to pay the bill, a huge bug, about the length of my pinkie finger, flew onto my arm.  I was disgusted.  I will not be returning!

really small place where everyone knows each other.  definitely good for locals looking for a quick affordable bite.  not good for those expecting lots of menu options or healthy alternatives.  friendly staff but overall restaurant needs updates.

Though the outside looks a tad shoddy, don't let the appearance turn you away. This is your typical diner - kinda small and packs in more seats than it probably should, with a friendly waitress and a cook in the back busy at the stove. I came here on a busy Saturday morning with a friend and we had to wait ~15 minutes for two seats at the counter. The waitress (whose name escapes me at the moment!) was extremely friendly and checked on us frequently despite the busy breakfast rush. My friend ordered the Cajun sausage gravy with home fries while I got blueberry pancakes with sausage. The bite of gravy and biscuits I had was delicious and I regret not ordering it as well, but my pancakes were also extremely satisfying. It came out to about $12 for the both of us, making it $15 for a meal for two. Not bad at all! A bonus is that if you're walking from Collegetown, the walk back definitely helps a full belly.

A true Ithaca native find: cheap eats and homestyle flair. Most of the breakfasts come with fresh coffee and homefries, the muffins are warmed, split in half and served with butter, and you can get fresh pie a la mode where the servings of ice cream are bigger than your pie slice. Patrons generally appear to be regulars. They come in groups bearing children, grandchildren, old friends and new girlfriends. They all seem to know the waiters and the cooks. Everyone discusses their personal life and passes photos around of their kids. It's intimate. But come early, because the seats fill fast and the wait can be awkward; people appear hard-pressed to leave. It probably doesn't help that a check never comes to your table; you approach the register when you're ready to deal with payment. Until then, enjoy the local fever.

In Ithaca for first time ... Gotta eat a breakfast ... so we Yelped a locals' favorite ... found Lincoln Diner. Perfect! (Five stars to Yelp! - never would've known of or found this place without you?/it?/us?) Off the beaten path. Greasy griddle delight. Five stars for the atmosphere. All the friendly neighborliness the other reviews highlight is true. Place was packed when we peaked in - but other customers moved over so we could fit ... at their table! Introduced himself and wife to me ... but didn't make it awkward by trying to talk to us thru the meal. Five stars for locals with acute social awareness. And five stars for the Cajun Sausage Gravy over Biscuits and Homefries ... one-of-a-kind greatness. They offer a number of interesting omelet specials. My wife & kids also enjoyed their more conventional fare ... eggs, bacon, bagel, etc. ... but it was "nothing special," they said. Go for the specials. $25 for family of 4. They take credit/debit cards for the bill. But you have to tip in cash.
Though the outside looks a tad shoddy, don't let the appearance turn you away. This is your typical diner - kinda small and packs in more seats than it probably should, with a friendly waitress and a cook in the back busy at the stove. I came here on a busy Saturday morning with a friend and we had to wait ~15 minutes for two seats at the counter. The waitress (whose name escapes me at the moment!) was extremely friendly and checked on us frequently despite the busy breakfast rush. My friend ordered the Cajun sausage gravy with home fries while I got blueberry pancakes with sausage. The bite of gravy and biscuits I had was delicious and I regret not ordering it as well, but my pancakes were also extremely satisfying. It came out to about $12 for the both of us, making it $15 for a meal for two. Not bad at all! A bonus is that if you're walking from Collegetown, the walk back definitely helps a full belly.
After reading the reviews, I really wanted to like Lincoln Street.  I love breakfast foods (who doesn't??), and I love a quick unpretentious diner for just that purpose.  A nice set of fried eggs, a quick slice of ham, a bit of toast?  Easy and delicious. Lincoln Street Diner really didn't do it for me.  The entire place is covered with a sticky  oily sheen.  The cooks don't even bother turning on the hoods over the griddle, so you leave the place smelling of grease, which is a slight improvement over sitting in a restaurant smelling of grease with your eyes tearing from the smoke. All would be well if the food was fine, but my over easy eggs came almost well done, my dry toast came soaked in butter, and my tea somehow turned into coffee.  Oh well.
A true Ithaca native find: cheap eats and homestyle flair. Most of the breakfasts come with fresh coffee and homefries, the muffins are warmed, split in half and served with butter, and you can get fresh pie a la mode where the servings of ice cream are bigger than your pie slice. Patrons generally appear to be regulars. They come in groups bearing children, grandchildren, old friends and new girlfriends. They all seem to know the waiters and the cooks. Everyone discusses their personal life and passes photos around of their kids. It's intimate. But come early, because the seats fill fast and the wait can be awkward; people appear hard-pressed to leave. It probably doesn't help that a check never comes to your table; you approach the register when you're ready to deal with payment. Until then, enjoy the local fever.
Lincoln Street Diner is the townie's answer to Cafe Dewitt for breakfast! Here you will find delicious omelets and home fries, perfectly cooked bacon, tasty coffee and the ultimate guilty breakfast pleasure: SAUSAGE GRAVY....all at totally reasonable prices.   You will not find pretense or wacky upscale brunch concoctions made with obscure expensive ingredients at outrageous prices. (Don't get me wrong....I do appreciate such things at times.) The service is great...I agree with the other reviewer that Erin is a riot and makes you feel like an old friend the second you sit down. Lincoln Street Diner is definitely worth seeking out....but I wouldn't feel too bad if you didn't since it already tends to be crowded!
In Ithaca for first time ... Gotta eat a breakfast ... so we Yelped a locals' favorite ... found Lincoln Diner. Perfect! (Five stars to Yelp! - never would've known of or found this place without you?/it?/us?) Off the beaten path. Greasy griddle delight. Five stars for the atmosphere. All the friendly neighborliness the other reviews highlight is true. Place was packed when we peaked in - but other customers moved over so we could fit ... at their table! Introduced himself and wife to me ... but didn't make it awkward by trying to talk to us thru the meal. Five stars for locals with acute social awareness.

The famed biscuits and gravy ran out way before we got there, but thankfully the corned beef hash and homemade mac 'n cheese lived up to the hype. The coffee and coffee cake were a delightful end to a satisfying meal. The servers were nice, especially the girl that filled our coffees and waters, so remember to tip well. Clean, friendly, cozy local diner. *Walk through the quaint neighborhood to nearby Ithaca Falls.

Chose the Lincoln Street Diner after searching Yelp for a good Ithaca breakfast spot and reading about the Diner's sausage gravy. Sat by the window at the counter with my daughter and she was pleased to find and electric socket to charge her cell. I had the combo sausage and Cajun sausage gravies severed over biscuit and home fries - a skunk in diner-speak because the two gravies form a stripe. The combination of the two gravies was savory, spicy and delicious with perfectly cooked home fries and a max-flaky biscuit. What a breakfast! Many thanks to all the Yelp members that shared this one. And many thanks to the Lincoln Street Philly Fans - you'd have to travel south of the Mason/Dixon to get sausage gravy and biscuits anywhere near this good... but they don't have the skunk combo and it ruled?!

Very average small diner, prices were very reasonable. I would go back there again. If I recall correctly seating was very limited. Service was about the most friendly, I recall getting in the commons. It has been a spell, I recall the décor being a bit tired, though it could have updated since my last visit, as it has been a spell.

Excellent place. I was in town visiting and was welcomed by everyone in the diner. The waitress, Erin, is a riot and makes for a wonderful experience. The food is top notch. I had a bruschetta omelet, which was incredible.

Old school small local dive diner, griddle at counter. Mixed re service: We walked in w family and there was one available table that was still full of dirty dishes. As we waited to sit, some totally rude dude came in and sat at "our" table. A waiter removed him, yay! and seated us. Meanwhile, rude dudes group arrived and were seated at a newly open table. Ultimately they finished their meal before we even ordered, hmpf. As for food: nothing special, as expected, kinda. We left with our bellies as well as our hair and skin full of grease. Gimme a Tums and a shower, and I'll be fine.

Simply put, Saturday would not be Saturday and Breakfast would not be Breakfast without the Lincoln Street Diner.   If you haven't, you should.  If you already have, you know.

A small hole in the wall place that doesn't look like much but great food, fast service, and super cheap! They were great at accommodating our group of 7 and had huge portions.

Cajun sausage gravy over cheddar buscuits!  Got to go! Service is great, homey, local joint.

Definitely the best diner in Ithaca. Everything is super inexpensive, and the food is tasty. However, the hours, oh the hours ... not night owl friendly at all :(

Really Cheap and simply delicious. I got the Bo Burger with a side of corned beef hash. Both were delicious and filling. Really fast service. The only downside is that it is not open on Sundays!

Just go and see what everybody is talking about.
This place is not for people who think any semblance of cleanliness is important.  It's covered in grease and syrup. I cannot remember if my pancakes were good.  The home fries were not good (not crispy -- just white potatoes that were mushy.   I wouldn't make a trip back.
Admittedly our first experience there.  The other reviews sum up this out-of-the way place well.  But the part that blew my wife & I away were the two different kinds of biscuits & gravy we tried.  I will not order biscuits & gravy in restaurants anymore because 99% of the time it's an awful pile of paste.  But for some reason we decided to go for it, and there it was, real honest-to-God gravy laden with its sausage.  Wife's was a Cajun style, and had a real kick to it, which was a pleasant change since we moved to Ithaca from Colorado and it's hard to find food with a hot kick. We shall definitely become regulars there!
Food was awesome and prices were cheap. Both combos make for a perfect diner!
This is a wonderful spot. Nice people and a solid breakfast menu. No frills here, which enhances the diner experience.
If you ever find yourself hungover in Ithaca, go to the Lincoln St Diner. If you want a great breakfast go to the Lincoln St Diner. Very cheap, good people, wonderful food.
Just go and see what everybody is talking about.
Great little neighborhood diner. It's right in the middle of a residential area with a beauty salon and a laundromat next door. It seats about 8 - 10 at the counter and perhaps 20 - 25 at tables. Very small but everything that's great about these little diners. Good food fast and at a good price. Daily specials and big portions. Customers are always filling this place up. Really nice to go for a quiet stroll and stop in for a bite to eat. Say hi to John at the grill.

I get in and out in less than 30 minutes... food is fresh and good. The service is pretty good too, thank you guys.

In town visiting my wife's kid sister at college. Looked on yelp came to the diner and ordered three meals the blue berry pancakes for my wife, this special consisting of corn muffin with gravy over everything for myself, and an egg white omelet with Homemade salsa on the side for my son. The blueberry pancakes tasted like candy they were so good. The special I got was exactly what I shouldn't eat and exactly what I wanted and it was great. My sons omelet was great but the homemade salsa he got made the meal. Suffice to say on my next trip I'll be back. Everything was great.

I've been going here since it was Bud's Diner.  First time in 1981 or 1982.  Always clean and serving good food.  It's small though, so sometimes it's hard to get in.  Worth a little wait.  Probably some of the best diner food in Ithaca.
This is a wonderful spot. Nice people and a solid breakfast menu. No frills here, which enhances the diner experience.
The best breakfast!!  Small, fun staff, with the most amazing breakfast foods.  I almost didn't write this because I want to keep it all to myself.  Delicious!
If you ever find yourself hungover in Ithaca, go to the Lincoln St Diner. If you want a great breakfast go to the Lincoln St Diner. Very cheap, good people, wonderful food.
After waiting about 40 minutes for my food, I noticed most of the people who came in after us and people who came in and order to go food were served before us. When I asked WHY I wasn't served I was told first come first serve.  Terrible service And the food wasn't even worth the wait.

Delicious food, very good service and a mix of Ithacans rarely seen in other places. Today an anniversary and a newcomer were announced to be celebrated by everyone in the diner.

I've lived in Ithaca for years and hadn't heard of this place.  It's a little neighborhood diner, nothing fancy. just a counter and a few tables. The staff was wonderful and courteous.  I got the Ziffy omelet with whole wheat toast, sausage gravy, and coffee.  Our waiter joked that they had three kinds of coffee: Coffee, Decaf, and More Coffee.  We ordered More Coffee.  The service was fast, the food was good, and the price was low. I enjoyed it.

This place is awesome!  It has a classic laid back diner feel.  Erin, the server, loves to announce when her "boyfriend" Larry arrives and leaves.  She is always willing to introduce new guests to the crowd to make them part of the family.  She has a smart ass comment about some things, but you know she is joking and it just part of the show.  It's always fun to sit at the bar and watch to cooks do their thing.  I get the bagel sandwiches.  They are nothing special but there is something about them that  cannot be duplicated at home.  The home fries are great.  The cajun sausage gravy is fantastic!  You need to go on Saturday and try it!

What an interesting place. I had eggs, corned beef hash, hash browns, rye toast, OJ, and coffee, all of which were very good, but not gourmet, or course. It's an eclectic crowd of all ages and persuasions. The absolute most delightful and entertaining aspect is Erin, who is the face and leader of the joint. She puts on a great floorshow with such announcements as, "Hey, everyone--listen up. This lady just switched from white to wheat toast. Let's give her a hand!" She calls large waters "hangover size," and she had us sing "Happy Birthday" to a diner, who seemed to be a fellow school teacher of hers from Lansing.

This diner experience is authentic and cheap. If you sit at the counter, you can watch them prepare your food. It is a really nice spot for some greasy breakfast on a budget and the food is tasty. The atmosphere is nice and quiet since the place is so tiny and out of the way of downtown Ithaca. If you can find time within their weird hours (which seems to be a trend with good breakfast places), I would recommend giving this place a shot.

When it comes to diners in Ithaca, you can't get much better than Lincoln Street.  There's just something about the space, the waitress, the cook (eggs are always perfect), the hashbrowns, and the clientele that makes me happy.

A true Ithaca classic.  Stop by on Saturday morning and sit at the counter. The waitress, Erin, is a hoot and she will make you feel like you're right at home. The food is exactly what you want from a diner. Fast tasty no-nonsense breakfast for a good price.  Blueberry pancakes and bacon, egg & cheese on a bagle are my favorites.  The home fries could use use a little work, but asking for some country or cajun gravy to smother them with fixes them right up.  Love this place. The food gets 4 stars, but the whole package puts it over the top to a 5/5.

Yelp you continue to have yet to let me down!  I did a search for diners when I was in Ithaca yesterday and this was the first place to pop up. Read a few reviews and said what the heck.  Found it in the quiet little residential area and walked in and were welcomed right away from the nicest waitress I have ever encountered. She then proceeded to introduce us to everyone in the restaurant since we were first timers and everyone welcomed us. The waitress and rest of the staff were very witty and funny which helped make the experience all the more enjoyable. I ordered the cajun sausage gravy with cheddar biscuits and homefries and my girlfriend ordered "mommas wrapped in babies" or the buffalo chicken omelette. Both meals were cooked up very quickly and were just amazing. I was told I did a good job for cleaning my plate but the waitress didn't have much to say about my girlfriend for leaving some food on her plate (if you don't have something nice to say, don't say it, haha). This was one of the best "greasy spoon" experiences that I have ever had and I will definitely return here anytime that I am in or around Ithaca.
