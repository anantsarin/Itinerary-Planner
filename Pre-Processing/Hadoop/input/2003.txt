For fans of Frank Lloyd Wright or all-American architecture, a visit to the Darwin Martin House is a must. It should blow your head off to learn that one of his most significant work is only a couple hours drive away from Toronto. Yes Toronto, there is more to Buffalo than just cross-border shopping, football and hot chicken wings... at least when it comes to modern American architecture. There are a handful of Wright-designed projects in Buffalo, but none more important or accessible than the Martin House. Given free reign to do virtually whatever by one of his most important clients (Martin was instrumental in Wright securing the commission for the sadly-demolished Larkin Building), FLW took this opportunity early in his career to explore to the extreme his Prairie Style design principles, producing an extraordinary mansion that reflected the family values of both Wright and the Martin family. In typical Wright fashion, we actually had a hilariously hard time finding the entrance, until discovering 10 minutes later that visitors must begin via the adjacent ultramodern building (Greatbatch Pavilion), where the scheduled tours begin. If you opt for the in-depth tour (which I highly recommend), you will be for a good hour led through both floors of the main house, as well as inside of the other houses built on the complex. Our guide projected much knowledge, down to the details like the window designs and how the roof drainage system works. Try not to mind so much the in-progress reno jobs. I am sure once the restoration is complete the whole site will best showcase Wright's original vision to our modern-day eyes. But even as it is now, the house expresses much magnificence that gives visitors a good glimpse of life inside a special FLW home. Some plights though: photography is forbidden, and there aren't much in terms of parking options (the Martin House website recommends parking at the nearby Buffalo Zoo and asking the House staff for a parking token).
I've lived in Buffalo for 20 years now and have gone to the Buffalo Zoo more times than I can count and can't believe it took me this long to visit! It was a gorgeous date day with my 17 year old. We decided to play tourists and visit.  I had read that reservations were recommended so we arrived at 3pm and called to see if we might be able to get in without one, they said yes so we parked the car. What a gem right in my own backyard! Visitors enter through the Greatbatch center pay admissions and watch a short video about the the Martins, Wright and the complex. We moved from there to the tour. The volunteer docent was very knowledgeable and full of passion. She emphasized the foresight of Frank Lloyd Wright in building the main house and other areas of the complex.  It was fascinating to hear the work and commitment that went into restoring the facility as we had people in the tour group that have been through the complex during the multi-phases of the restoration process. Such dedication. Definitely recommend! Educational and relaxing. Just wear comfortable shoes as you will be walking around and standing for about 1.5 hrs.
Sometimes I pretend to like architecture so that girls would like me. Sad life, I know. I remember in my teens I would invite girls out to museums on first dates so they would think I was sophisticated or whatever. Sometimes it worked, but other times they laughed while I stumbled over myself to feign appreciation. Or maybe this only happened in my head? I don't even know. I could barely get a prom date in high school. In fact, she broke up with me before prom and ended up dancing with a friend of mine at this cursed event. Well, who's laughing now, all the women who didn't want me in the past?! I've become a dude who genuinely enjoys museums, art galleries and architecture. Through traveling through the States, Russia, Estonia...I've enjoyed seeing, climbing on and experiencing some pretty fantastic sights. The view from atop St. Nicholas Top Naval Cathedral in St. Petersburg? Gorgeous. Old Town in Estronia with its cobblestone and castle-like medieval buildings? I want to go back now! Fallingwater in Mill Run, PA? I still have fond memories of seeing the building with my-then new friend and now fiancé. I think I even sincerely appreciate architecture now. Buffalo is truly blessed to have the Darwin Martin House. Not only for all those lucky teens and college students who can totally woo an architecture nerd by inviting her out on a date here, but also for us younger and older adults who have grown to appreciate the symmetry, beauty and history of Frank Lloyd Wright's work. The history of this building is fascinating and the staff who work here brim with passion for the building. They could tell you its history from being contracted to be built the Darwin family in the early 1900s to actually housing the President of UB in the 1960s. What a lucky bastard to have that be one of the perks of the job. Finally, the Darwin Martin Corporation (non-profit) has been enlisted with the task or preserving and renovating the building and keeping it open to the public before it becomes a NYS Park of sorts. They have poured over $50 million into renovating the house and having it be open to the public for tours and it shows. It's now in impeccable condition, although there's still work to be done. The structure of it and how it stands is fascinating as you'll learn that it's built much like a Chicago skyscraper where the walls don't actually hold the building up. This allows for perfect symmetry and many more windows and a blending of the inner and outer structure to really invite outside nature to "live inside the house." Really though, the staff truly explains all this much better than I can in this review and their passion for it is infectious. So come see some of Wright's living work here. Take a tour, check their web site to see if they have events coming up that you would enjoy and celebrate with me that this is so accessible in our backyard.

As far as Frank Lloyd Wright structures go Buffalo has, in a typical display of "bufflalonian" (see Urban Dictionary) wisdom and foresight, managed to tear down more of his architectural wonders than any other city has ever had such as one of his largest undertakings, the Larkin Building, which the city demolished for no other good purpose than to create parking lot. Fortunately there remain two rather good Frank Lloyd Wright homes in the area of Buffalo that one may tour and the Darwin Martin House happens to be one of them. Without getting into any details about it, Frank Lloyd Wright undoubtedly stands out as an architectural genius with unique detailing plus innovations which were way ahead of their time. However, being way of time is not necessarily such a good thing, because unless you have unlimited amounts of money and can afford open wallet upkeep and repairs, just maintaining anyone of his homes would bankrupt most multimillionaires. They're all prone to falling apart (Falling Waters just about fell into the water) and this place, the Darwin Martin House, has been under renovation of well over a decade at costs exceeding $25 million and is still not complete. The tours are pricey and not all that exciting but well worth the time and money to have an opportunity to see and learn what Frank Lloyd Wright and his architecture were all about. It's a big house (not really a home) which I would doubt would be all that comfortable to actual live in, but it's loaded with what were at the time cutting edge technology, uniqueness of design and unparalleled attention to detail.

Came to the Darwin Martin house for a local beer tasting event with yelper extraordinaire  Krista M who also just happens to be my sister. And upon pulling up and parking I was blown away by the architecture that was put into this building just being on the outside of the building made me really appreciate what great structures and buildings buffalo has hidden away. I had no idea this place existed and so close to the buffalo zoo which I would go to as a child. The beer event was also well organized and the "tickets" we where given has no value at most stations they just simply wanted you to taste their beer and taste lots of it lol. The pearl street brewery was my top fav. While the brewery with the loganberry beer was second I just wish I could recall their name... Guess I tasted a lot of beer that day haha.... Well after a quick google search everyone needs to check out Resurgence brewery down on Niagara st in blo. Since joining yelp and attending some events it has definitely opened my eyes on how much stuff there really is to do in this great city. Thanks yelp.
If you like FLW or even just enjoy beautiful architecture, take time to visit this home. It is beautiful, the renovation is stunning, and it's seemingly only just beginning. The docents are knowledgeable and well-spoken, and the 45 minute tour is worth it! The Greatbatch Pavilion located next door is another gorgeous example of architecture, and the staff there is wonderful. We hosted an event there for dinner, and they were nothing but accommodating and friendly. I would happily visit and work with them again.

It was a great way to spend a Monday afternoon with a few out of town guests.  I loved the tour, the history behind the house and the story of Martin and Wirght. Make sure you buy your tickets online before you go, they seem to sell out often.   We did the 1 hour tour, where we watched a video in the new visitor center and saw the main house. The highlight was definitely our docent.  She was perfect, very knowledgeable and was great at telling the story of the house.   The house is cool and so interesting, but parts of the interior are still being restored (2nd floor and kitchen).

As far as architecture is concerned, there is no greater name than Frank Lloyd Wright, and this masterpiece is perhaps the best accessible house of his design still standing. Yes, there are several notable examples in Chicago, but none on such a grand scale as the Martin House is. As you marvel at the modern lines of the house, keep in mind that it is old enough that it was built with a stable, since the wealthy man who had it built had yet to buy his first automobile.Also, note that this house was a vacant ruin for about 25 years, and narrowly escaped the fate of possibly his greatest commecial design, Buffalo's Larkin Administration Building (destroyed in 1950). If you are bold enough to take the subway here to this landmark, be reassured that, even though you are in a ghetto, it IS nearby. Some of the best houses in Buffalo are hiding behind slums. Now, I still have to see Taliesin, and Taliesin West.....

This is a terrific facility with alot of history.  It was renovated some 10 years ago, but they continue to improve it.   The event space there is also great, and the catering I have experienced has been very well done.

Buffalo, New York, contains a wealth of architectural gems, and the newly-restored Darwin-Martin house complex, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, should only burnish the city's reputation.  The city contains a good number of Wright structures, including a boathouse and mausoleum, but the Darwin-Martin house complex is a stunning example of Wright's prairie-style. Restoration is in the final phases on the exterior, but the interiors are still a work in progress; so, it's an exciting time to visit.  If you think Buffalo is just snow, football and chicken wings, then visiting the Darwin-Martin house complex will help you shake off the stereotype blues.

This is a stunning work of Frank Lloyd Wright's early career. The restoration team has been so hard at work with this property. It looks fantastic. I am excited to go back once it has been more completely restored. We went on the in-depth tour and it was worth every cent. The tour guide was fantastic. This place is a gem that we are lucky to have in Buffalo. The new visitor center is great, as well. Stunning architeture in itself.

The Wright complex is wonderful.  I'm not sure the building has looked so great in a long time.  Our tour in late July 2010 did not include the interior of the main house since they were doing asbestos abatment, but they gave us the slightly different tour that more than made up for the difference.  The docents are excellent, if a bit slanted towards Wright (to be expected I guess).  The history, the architecture and the restoration work are top notch. Don't miss the visitor's center (Greatbatch Pavilion).  It's a restrained piece that compliments the Martin house in a way that does justice to both buildings.  The audio visual presentation starts with your back towards the house as the images are displayed on glass.  At the conclusion of the presentation, the screens go dark and the house is reflected in the glass.  Bravo Toshiko Mori, Bravo! If you are in the area, dig deeper into the website and take the combined  tour with Graycliff in nearby Derby.  It's another Wright house for the same family on the shore of Lake Erie.  It was done after the Martin house and your can see what the same architect does when he has a limited budget.  Fantastic

What a great way to spend our time in Buffalo!  We had a very interesting tour with Karen Smith.  Love learning about the heart and soul that was put into this home.  Walking through, I imagined what it was like growing up in the family--it was warm and welcoming and so appeasing to the eye.  I highly recommend a visit if you are in the area.  I would wait to do the 'extended' tour until more of the project is completed, although it may be interesting now too!

A true master work of art by Frank Lloyd Wright. They've done a wonderful job restoring this site to its original grandeur. Our tour guide was very knowledgable and friendly.  The complex is located in a beautiful historic Buffalo neighborhood designed by famous landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, the man who designed Central Park in NYC.

I liked it.   I was in Buffalo for work, and needed to visit this site.  Before getting a full time music job (yes, they exist), I worked for a prominent Frank Lloyd Wright organization in their shops as an Assistant Manager and I was the primary Sales Trainer....so I have a bias as well as a background.  I developed an interest in FLW's work via working in that store.  After so many years, it just had hooks in me, so when my day job brought me to Buffalo for a week-I made a point in taking a tour.   The Experience.... Visitor Center They have good signage.  I took a cab to the site, and immediately knew where to go without asking any questions.  The staff at the visitor's center were nice, and provided just the (W)right amount of information.  I knew the essentials-where the tour started, where the bathroom was, and what I could do in the mean time.   Ok, I also thought it was awesome that they had a visitors center.  Having the ticket sales/people waiting for tours separate from the shop functioned extremely well!  They had enough displays available to view that you could easily kill 20mins before a tour.  If you read every last sentence of information, probably 45mins.  I treated it as a refresher in FLW history, and spent more time on the info that was specific to Darwin Martin and this specific site.   The Tour I opted for the 2 hour in depth tour.  The price seemed pretty fair at just under $30.  The docent was good-had an awesome voice (full and projecting-never struggled to hear a word), and the docent bringing up the rear was great too.  I think the one in back was in training, and was playing crowd control while observing the front docent.  My tour ran over by about 15mins; for me, this wasn't any big deal.  I booked my tour on a day where I was free for about 8hrs, with a solid 5hrs budgeted for travel to/from the site, the tour, and shopping.    As strange as it sounds, at over 2hrs, the tour still felt rushed. There is a LOT of ground to cover in two hours, and I'm not talking about the historical side.  There is a ton of square footage included in the tour.  I liked the spaces that we were allowed to see, it felt like we were able to see enough to get a good feel of the vision of the house.  Our docent hit on several key elements of Wright's style, but didn't mention the five influences of Wright.  If you are familiar with Wright, this isn't a big deal, but he made some allusions that would have dove tailed perfectly.  We saw areas that were in various states of restoration, ranging from fully restored, to barely started.  I could see this tour going up to around $45 and 2.5-3 hours, if logistics permitted.  However, $30 seemed like a bargain to see this many distinct spaces...even if at times it felt more like "Here's this space...cool, ain't it?"   The group size was a bit larger than I expected at a sold out 16, some of the spaces felt cramped with this many people of varying mobility levels.  I do not recommend the indepth tour if you, or someone in your party, is mobility challenged-the house is not handicap accessible (it's a historic site built in the early 1900's), there aren't hand rails on the stairs, and you are walking all of maybe 5mins.   Overall, I enjoyed the tour.  The spaces were astounding.  I learned a good chunk, and got a refresher on other elements.  It made me smile hearing all of the Chicago references.  I made a point in NOT telling the docents about my Chicago/FLW connection until after the tour.  The docents were spot on, available for questions without giving spoilers for key elements of the tour, gave clear information, and were very enthusiastic about the house.  I got a nice reaction out of both docents when I told them my FLW/Chicago connection as well as my military connection.   Shop Ok, there was no way I was going to go on a tour, and NOT do some shopping.  However, I have different tastes and represent a different demographic than most FLW site shoppers.  A. I'm only 26, B. I'm not rich, C. I prefer black t-shirts, and D. I don't own a house.  So, I got the two items that I planned on getting (I browsed via their website first) and two items on impulse.  The tour ended in the shop, but to avoid the crowd, I opted to take pictures of the exterior at that point.  This gave the shop a chance to clear a bit before diving in.  They sell three varieties of shot glasses/shooters...that was an impulse buy for me.  The shop staff were efficient, but I didn't notice any upselling, or much interaction beyond just moving the lines as fast as possible.  I liked the merchandise selection, but the shop felt pretty small.  I did have to remind myself "you don't have much room left in your suitcase", they had several books that sparked my interest.  Some of the t-shirts, I think would make awesome posters.   Overall I liked it.  It was well worth it.  A must see if you like Frank Lloyd Wright.

I'd have given it 5 stars, but I felt the $15 admission fee was steep considering you only get to see one main floor of the house (which was not very far along in the restoration process). What you do get to see is stunning.  As big of an asshole as he was, Frank Lloyd Wright was an amazing architect and one of the greatest minds of our century.  In the front room, there was a beautiful half-crescent moon brick inlaid fireplace.  When you turn around, there is a row of small rectangular windows, with glass panels running along the outside underneath each window.  It was explained to us that these glass panels were perfectly placed just to capture the outside light, reflect that light into each of the rectangular windows (which when originally built, all contained intricate art-glass pieces done in Wright's famous pieced-style), which is in turn reflected down onto the carpet and across the room, bringing the eye up along the walls and then to the fireplace.  The entire room was designed to be in harmony with nature (as all of Frank's work).. the walls contain gold-flecked paint between the earth toned brick, to mimic natural light.  The woodwork was said to be like branches of trees reaching up to the sky (the ceiling), and giving way to the fireplace (representing sun and moon). His work speaks to me like poetry.  It's just so moving.  It's a shame they wouldn't allow even non-flash photography inside the complex.  I did manage a few pictures of the re-constructred terrarium.  I was a little turned off by the awful metal and glass structure they're building right next door, it's supposed to be the new visitor's center.  It's hideous and looks very frigid - it just struck me as such a polar opposite to Frank's work and I think he would've disapproved of it greatly.  It distracts the visitor from the remaining structure of the Darwin Martin Complex completely. That said, this is definitely an exceptional piece of work and architectural history that is absolutely worth a trip out to see if you're in Buffalo.

I'm afraid I can't write as glowing a review as the other Yelpers. I mean don't get me wrong, Wright was an amazing architect and the Martin complex is a jewel in the necklace of structures he's built in Buffalo and across the U.S. But as a museum experience it was just o.k. The tour (basic) and admission does not come cheaply and the museum is far from finished, only two rooms are complete on the first floor and the second is completely off limits. I'm glad the house is being restored to it's former glory just not as glad to be funding the progress...

Visitor Center They have good signage.  I took a cab to the site, and immediately knew where to go without asking any questions.  The staff at the visitor's center were nice, and provided just the (W)right amount of information.  I knew the essentials-where the tour started, where the bathroom was, and what I could do in the mean time.   Ok, I also thought it was awesome that they had a visitors center.  Having the ticket sales/people waiting for tours separate from the shop functioned extremely well!  They had enough displays available to view that you could easily kill 20mins before a tour.  If you read every last sentence of information, probably 45mins.  I treated it as a refresher in FLW history, and spent more time on the info that was specific to Darwin Martin and this specific site.   The Tour I opted for the 2 hour in depth tour.  The price seemed pretty fair at just under $30.  The docent was good-had an awesome voice (full and projecting-never struggled to hear a word), and the docent bringing up the rear was great too.  I think the one in back was in training, and was playing crowd control while observing the front docent.  My tour ran over by about 15mins; for me, this wasn't any big deal.  I booked my tour on a day where I was free for about 8hrs, with a solid 5hrs budgeted for travel to/from the site, the tour, and shopping.    As strange as it sounds, at over 2hrs, the tour still felt rushed. There is a LOT of ground to cover in two hours, and I'm not talking about the historical side.  There is a ton of square footage included in the tour.  I liked the spaces that we were allowed to see, it felt like we were able to see enough to get a good feel of the vision of the house.  Our docent hit on several key elements of Wright's style, but didn't mention the five influences of Wright.  If you are familiar with Wright, this isn't a big deal, but he made some allusions that would have dove tailed perfectly.  We saw areas that were in various states of restoration, ranging from fully restored, to barely started.  I could see this tour going up to around $45 and 2.5-3 hours, if logistics permitted.  However, $30 seemed like a bargain to see this many distinct spaces...even if at times it felt more like "Here's this space...cool, ain't it?"   The group size was a bit larger than I expected at a sold out 16, some of the spaces felt cramped with this many people of varying mobility levels.  I do not recommend the indepth tour if you, or someone in your party, is mobility challenged-the house is not handicap accessible (it's a historic site built in the early 1900's), there aren't hand rails on the stairs, and you are walking all of maybe 5mins.   Overall, I enjoyed the tour.  The spaces were astounding.  I learned a good chunk, and got a refresher on other elements.  It made me smile hearing all of the Chicago references.  I made a point in NOT telling the docents about my Chicago/FLW connection until after the tour.  The docents were spot on, available for questions without giving spoilers for key elements of the tour, gave clear information, and were very enthusiastic about the house.  I got a nice reaction out of both docents when I told them my FLW/Chicago connection as well as my military connection.   Shop Ok, there was no way I was going to go on a tour, and NOT do some shopping.  However, I have different tastes and represent a different demographic than most FLW site shoppers.  A. I'm only 26, B. I'm not rich, C. I prefer black t-shirts, and D. I don't own a house.  So, I got the two items that I planned on getting (I browsed via their website first) and two items on impulse.  The tour ended in the shop, but to avoid the crowd, I opted to take pictures of the exterior at that point.  This gave the shop a chance to clear a bit before diving in.  They sell three varieties of shot glasses/shooters...that was an impulse buy for me.  The shop staff were efficient, but I didn't notice any upselling, or much interaction beyond just moving the lines as fast as possible.  I liked the merchandise selection, but the shop felt pretty small.  I did have to remind myself "you don't have much room left in your suitcase", they had several books that sparked my interest.  Some of the t-shirts, I think would make awesome posters.   Overall I liked it.  It was well worth it.  A must see if you like Frank Lloyd Wright.
Visited this place for the 1st time on 7/6/11 & it was amazing!! The main house is still being restored but there's still plenty to see that will give you more than just a basic idea of Wright's vision & genius. One thing I noticed right away is that the pergola, the covered walkway from the house to the greenhouse, works in its concept: the day that I was there was pretty warm, high 80s, & the walk thru the pergola was quite cool, just like Wright had planned. The tour guides, even the one who was in training while we were there, were both very knowledgeable & very friendly. GO HERE, it's a chance to see American architectural history, especially Wright's Prairie school of design. There's also a very cool package tour of this house and Graycliff starting at about $26. It's well worth the price to be able to tour both places. You can conceivably do both in one day (morning & afternoon) but plan for 2 days.
I'd have given it 5 stars, but I felt the $15 admission fee was steep considering you only get to see one main floor of the house (which was not very far along in the restoration process). What you do get to see is stunning.  As big of an asshole as he was, Frank Lloyd Wright was an amazing architect and one of the greatest minds of our century.  In the front room, there was a beautiful half-crescent moon brick inlaid fireplace.  When you turn around, there is a row of small rectangular windows, with glass panels running along the outside underneath each window.  It was explained to us that these glass panels were perfectly placed just to capture the outside light, reflect that light into each of the rectangular windows (which when originally built, all contained intricate art-glass pieces done in Wright's famous pieced-style), which is in turn reflected down onto the carpet and across the room, bringing the eye up along the walls and then to the fireplace.  The entire room was designed to be in harmony with nature (as all of Frank's work).. the walls contain gold-flecked paint between the earth toned brick, to mimic natural light.  The woodwork was said to be like branches of trees reaching up to the sky (the ceiling), and giving way to the fireplace (representing sun and moon). His work speaks to me like poetry.  It's just so moving.  It's a shame they wouldn't allow even non-flash photography inside the complex.  I did manage a few pictures of the re-constructred terrarium.  I was a little turned off by the awful metal and glass structure they're building right next door, it's supposed to be the new visitor's center.  It's hideous and looks very frigid - it just struck me as such a polar opposite to Frank's work and I think he would've disapproved of it greatly.  It distracts the visitor from the remaining structure of the Darwin Martin Complex completely. That said, this is definitely an exceptional piece of work and architectural history that is absolutely worth a trip out to see if you're in Buffalo.
Buffalo is lucky to have such an amazing peice of architecture within its borders.  This is one of Frank Lloyd Wright's masterpeices and the last few years, so much money has gone into restoring this home and preserving it for years to come.  Nice gift shop (Wisteria Shop) with unique and beautiful Frank Lloyd Wright gifts.  The Visitor's Center is beautiful and a work of art in and of itself.  And if you take a walk about a mile further - you can see the privately owned Davidson House on Tillinghast that is also a Frank Lloyd Wright home.
I'm afraid I can't write as glowing a review as the other Yelpers. I mean don't get me wrong, Wright was an amazing architect and the Martin complex is a jewel in the necklace of structures he's built in Buffalo and across the U.S. But as a museum experience it was just o.k. The tour (basic) and admission does not come cheaply and the museum is far from finished, only two rooms are complete on the first floor and the second is completely off limits. I'm glad the house is being restored to it's former glory just not as glad to be funding the progress...
On a recent trip to Buffalo, we stopped in to tour the Dwight Martin House.  They have guided tours, and we decided to take the intensive two hour version, which was well worth it.  It included both the main house, where interior renovations are still on going, and two additional buildings that have been completed.  It gave a good picture of Frank Lloyd Wright's interiors as well as how he went about creating the exteriors.  It was truly fascinating and a great break.

Took the 1 hour tour of this beautiful house. I love Frank Lloyd Wright. If you have time make sure you see this!

This was a interesting House to see even though they are still doing a lot of restoration work.on it. I do agree that the $15.00 admission price is rather steep.

Worth every penny to see a Frank Lloyd Wright masterpiece.  Tour guides were informative and friendly.  Do yourself a favor and check it out!  I would also recommend seeing Graycliff south of the city, they do some kind of double deal if you get tickets for both FLW houses.
My real score is 3.25. I think whether or not you enjoy the Darwin Martin House Complex has to do with why you have come there: if you are a Frank Lloyd Wright aficionado determined to see as many of his properties as possible, you'll be pleased. If you are there to learn more, you will probably be left wanting. The main house is currently closed for asbestos remediation and, rather incredibly, there aren't even photos of the interior on display. We saw the other buildings but no photography is permitted inside (no, not even flash-free) so the only shots we were able to take are the same as those any passerby could snap. The docent was really sweet but didn't give a focused presentation, leaving out facts like the dates of construction and completion and saying vague things such as, "It is a real Chinese puzzle" to discuss the architecture while emphasizing really obvious points like the horizontality of buildings. The few rooms we did see (and there were only 4) weren't well staged with period furniture, though there were a few chairs and settees here and there. Overall, it was a bit of a letdown.
