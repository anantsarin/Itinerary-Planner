We were looking to purchase a tail coat, which is a much more difficult task than I thought going in.  We stopped at a lot of stores, many that only rented tail coats. We walked into Samuel's and it was staffed by three young-ish men with no pretensions, dressed casually.  The first thing Mike did was to size up my son and ask how old he is.  He's 17 and Mike speculated that he'll probably grow another 2 inches (I agree).  He talked with my son about how to tailor the coat so that it can grow with him and he'll be able to have it forever. He also gave him a lecture on how to keep the coat in excellent condition and make sure it lasts for years. They took the lad's measurements and we should have the coat within the next 2 weeks.  The entire visit was painless and friendly, which was a huge relief after spending hours looking for a decent men's formal wear shop. It was incredibly easy to find and there was a small parking lot in front - parking was probably the biggest problem we encountered during our tail coat adventure.  I don't know what the price points are for men's formal wear, but I didn't feel like we were overpriced for the tail coat.  I could have gotten a cheaper coat online, but I think the quality would suffer and we would have to pay for alterations after it arrived anyway, so it probably equals out. Not that I'll have another reason to go shopping for men's formal wear, but if I ever did need it, I'd go back here first thing.
