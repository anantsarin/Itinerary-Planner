The Syracuse War Memorial (a hockey rink) was were all the concerts in Syracuse were held.  Not exactly the best venue for music.  Then the Syracuse Landmark Theatre started to book music acts and it really made a difference.  All the seats were good and the building itself is a beautifully restored old Loews' Theater.   I have seen the Kinks, Bob Dylan (Slow Train Coming Tour), Rossington-Collins Band, Elvis Costello (X opened for them without Billy Zoom) and several others.  Every show was enjoyable.   I also once went to a wedding here as well.
I've seen a couple concerts here, as well as two comedy shows. I have never been disappointed by any of my experiences at the Landmark.  For the concerts, sound was great and since it's such a small theatre, you feel very connected to the musicians.  The same goes for a comedy show, I had the pleasure of seeing both Jerry Seinfeld and George Carlin here and the view was fine for both - as were the acoustics. I only have a couple complaints, and they are very minor.  One - if you see a show here, plan on standing in line if you get there a little early - and if you are seeing a show during the winter months, you'll be cold.   The other complaint is the concession area, which seems to get bunched up pretty easily, and I don't believe you can bring food/drinks back to your seat.   Both of my complaints are due to the size of the Landmark, so this is expected. The trade off is worth it when you can see performances in such an intimate place.
