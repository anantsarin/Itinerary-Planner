I took my first wonderful yoga class here (Om with Meg on Tuesday nights), and I've been hooked since.  Sukha offers a variety of classes, levels, styles, and moods with their talented and compassionate teachers.  Their dedicated yoga studio is on their 2nd floor studio space (the 1st floor/main level is reception, retail, and a large dance studio space).  Sukha is truly an "Arts Center" practicing Yoga by Donation so yoga can be accessible to all, a non-competitive dance center, and offers Art classes as well.   The staff is warm and friendly - they really try to get to know everyone and you feel welcome every time.  It's also super convenient that they have a retail space where they sell snacks and beverages, which is great because I am always hungry.  They also lend mats (and have blankets, straps, blocks for use) which I LOVE, since its lame when studios "rent" out their mats.
I only recently found this incredible jewel. The owner Christine and her staff of teachers are so great.It is a warm, inviting and peaceful studio.  I love that the studio works on donations. These teachers are worth every dollar!! Please if you are even remotely interested in taking yoga, I totally recommend the Sukha Arts Center!!
