The Carriage House Cafe is every bit as good as the reviews say. It has an incredibly cute interior. Their coffee is good (they even make little designs in the foam of your cappicino)! And it feels like a secret discovery. Wifey and I visited for lunch on Saturday, which landed us smack into brunch time. We didn't mind. Wifey got the Brie-Stuffed french toast, which she absolutely loved. I got the smoked salmon - which was basically, "make your own lox and bagels" except with thin bread slices instead of bagels. Decent but not nearly as amazing as my wife's dish (I tried it, so I know).  Although everything looked good on the menu, I would have liked to see a few more lunch items. For brunch, it was totally breakfast oriented. Also of note, be prepared to wait when you come. There was definitely a lunchtime rush that came through around 12:30-1:00ish, and although wait times were less than 15mins, about 4-6 parties had to wait at various intervals. I would definitely like to try The Carriage House for a traditional lunch or dinner, and will put it on my list of places to take guests. Thanks again to Yelp for facilitating restaurant discoveries!
There are very few places that I like to meet up with friends and brunch at here in Ithaca, NY, but The Carriage House Cafe is one of them. Its rustic, yet cozy decor is quite stunning. As much as it is a space intended for a moderately sized group, the Cafe is private and comfortable enough to accomodate you by your lonesome or two. The menu and diverse food selections are where its at. I've sampled two of their house specialties: the smoked salmon plate with fig as well as their infamous, brie stuffed french toast lightly drenched with a berry puree. Both entrees, extremely well made, delivered every time I've ordered them. While the cafe does provide the usual brunch beverages, like mimosas, they are unfortunately not unlimited. This is a minor shortcoming on the cafe's menu for a mimosa lover like me. The chai lattes, however, do make up for that, especially on a blustering, winter morning. Waitering service is, at times, a mixed bag. My friends and I have been exposed to both ends of the extreme--either too attentive or too negligent and impersonal. Among the other, top brunch contenders (Stella and Ruloff's) in Collegetown, Carriage House stands out with its classic and mouth-watering entrees.
I am only comfortable writing reviews for restaurants/diners/etc if I've tried their food/drinks several times. As for Carriage House, I've been here every two or three weekends since coming to Ithaca, and I plan to continue my streak. The food is usually very, very good. So far, I've had the strata (a delicious savory bread pudding with good texture... I love the artichoke), the brie-stuffed french toast (amazing, very sweet, but without losing the flavor of the brie and the toast itself), and the corn-beef hash is always a winner (two over-easy eggs, please). And the specials are usually good too. In particular, I remember one of their leek soups... it was great. Not too salty or watery. Nothing here is too over-done, but everything is still very flavorful. Oh, and I almost always get a vanilla steamer and a side of garlic home fries. On the other hand, the Vietnamese sandwich isn't that special to me, and the salmon LT was kind of dry when I got it. Aside from the food, the service is also good. The servers are usually friendly and helpful. If you like homey places to dine, this is good for that. I like chatting it up when the servers are so friendly. One server in particular talked to me about his past interest in attending law school. and he remembered the next time I ate there. I enjoy that personal connection you get with homier places like this. My only complaints about Carriage House are that it is hard to get seated if you go for real brunch (between 10:30 am and 12 noon or so) because it is CROWDED and that it is not open for dinner! Arguably the best brunch/lunch in all of Ithaca. I highly recommend it.
Great place with delicious food and friendly staff! I got brie stuffed french toast, Latte and Yerba Mate tea and all were delicious! It has cute outdoor sitting surrounded by flowers :) and inside is also very nice + they have comfy couches if you want to go for a tea or coffee only :)!
I really enjoyed the Carriage House!  I liked the atmosphere and menu selections.  I unfortunately am only spending a week in Ithaca so I won't be able to make it back for another try. I ordered the brie stuffed french toast.  It was a wonderful dish and I would definitely recommend it to a friend.  There was a perfect amount of syrup and some sort of jam which came on the plate, just enough for the whole piece.  I however, wasn't impressed with the lack of "stuffed" the french toast isn't actually "stuffed" it's just brie sandwiched between two pieces of french toast.  This is fine, I would have actually still ordered the french toast with brie since I had never had it, but in Minneapolis, Minnesota when I read, "stuffed french toast" on a menu, it is actually "stuffed".   So why does it matter if it's actually stuffed or sandwiched?  I'll tell you.  They're two different words with two different meanings with two different expectations.  Maybe I'm just being picky, but I expected a higher brie to french toast ratio and the brie to be inside the toast. All of my picky-ness aside, being stuffed or sandwiched they would have tasted the same and the flavor was amazing.  I would have liked more brie though. I love how almost everything, if not everything was locally made, organic, and almost everything all the way to the condiments were made in house.  The downside to this is, you pay a little extra. My biggest complaint would be the service.  Because of other yelp reviews I decided to time (with my iPhone) how long it took our food to be served from the moment we ordered.  It was almost 30 minutes on the dot.  Also, our waitress fulfilled the bare minimum expectations of a waitress.  She wasn't rude, but it seemed like she didn't want to be there... maybe it was an off day for her, but whatever her issue, it reflected into her stature.
Great atmosphere & location, very friendly staff! Pumpkin soup was delicious, Omlet of the day and breakfast sandwich were def yummy, but nothing super special (considering the price)- apparently the brie stuffed french toast is what's draws people in for breakfast. I would absolutely recommend visiting, maybe try lunch next time... they had some appetizing options! Coffee, tea, pastries & wine + atmosphere here are a given must!
Now that Just a Taste and Maxies don't do brunch anymore, the Carriage House Cafe has the best brunch in town.  I love the food here - you can tell that the best ingredients are used and that they make everything there.  I am especially in love with their Sconewich (I know it sounds like diner-fare, but it's awesome) (I like to order ham on it as well), and their smoked salmon plate with figs and goat cheese.  They have great bread and sell it by the loaf as well. The cafe has an interesting vibe to it and is full of random antique type objects and furniture (I guess I don't really care about that - but hey, if it's your thing...).  The service is good - and it has improved since they opened.  I haven't been up to their second floor but I have heard that it's gorgeous. Oh - and most importantly!  This is the only place in town besides Gimme Coffee that can make a decent espresso drink so that is an enormous plus.  Brunch without great coffee is kind of a bummer, so I'm psyched that at least one place in town can deliver!
Decent brunch food in Ithaca. No complaints about the food there. We had the sconewhich which was a scone with cheese and egg which was very tasty. The scone was a savory scone with sausage, buttery and flaky. Also ordered the Brie stuffed brioche toast, interesting combination however would be nice if there was more Brie. Apple cider mimosa was like a cider beer. Pretty good!
We went for Saturday brunch expecting a wait, so the wait wasn't too bad (~40 minutes). I've been looking forward to coming here after many recommendations from friends and definitely wanted to try it once before I graduated. I definitely wasn't disappointed. We got the brie stuffed french toast and steak sandwich. Both were so yummy! (Pretty pricey for just french toast though) I really liked the decor, it was like a cute cottage house. Also, it really resonates as a cute Sunday brunch place. I had a great experience overall-- food & service, so I would recommend this place.
Group of 8 of us went here over reunion weekend for  some mildly hungover brunch. This place was great! Food was all delicious, fresh and very reasonably priced. Coffee was great (said the coffee drinkers at the table) and drinks were happily refilled as we needed it. I had the strata of the day which was divine, people loved the omelette, and the sconewiches were gobbled up. Easily would come back here next time we're in town.
Alright, you're in ithaca and there isnt all that much around for good food. So in comparison to the other restaurants here for Carriage House's food (specialized for brunch) is amazing and hence the 5 star rating. Atmosphere is as good as it gets around this area and the cost is a bit on the pricier end but then again so is everything nearby. The Ruben is amazing, and a half size is decent if you don't want a too large of a meal. Usually when i get Rubens in Ithaca the bread comes really hard or the corned beef tastes really bad but not here, it is excellent. Best place to have brunch in collegetown/downtown area, hands down.
We had brunch at the Carriage House for the first time today. It is cozy and quaint, with a lot of exposed fieldstone and rustic antiques. According to our local friend, it really was an actual carriage house back in the 1850s (hooray for history!). I feel like all they need is a working fireplace, a genial grandmother, and some labrador retrievers to really nail the slice-of-country-in-the-city atmosphere. We got there right at noon, so we expected a wait. We passed the 30-ish minutes with our coffee upstairs in the hayloft, but there are a few chairs and benches outside as well if the weather is nice. What can I say about the amazing brie-stuffed French toast besides GET IN MAH MOUTH. As I was stuffing my face, I noticed that everyone else's orders--the breakfast sandwich, the Carriage House burger, and the curry and beet salad--looked delicious as well. My only complaint is that our waitress disappeared from the time she served our food to the time she cleared our plates, so our water glasses were empty for half the meal. Otherwise, it was a fantastic experience and we will definitely be back.
A must, if you can get a reservation here - their brunch is to die for.  The brie-stuffed french toast must be ordered, and their house salmon plate adds a nice balance to the sweetness of the former dish. I came with a rather large group (8-10 folks), but we were seated within 10 minutes on a Saturday afternoon (albeit at two separate tables, which was perfectly fine with us).  The service was great, and the atmosphere was totally unique (it feels like you're sitting in someone's mini barn). Just goes to show that there are places other than Collegetown Bagels for a hearty (and unique!) brunch experience.
This place had a great atmosphere, but be prepared to wait. Omelet of the day was tasty... Onion, artichoke, sundried tomatoes and parm cheese. Yummy. Latte was good but not very strong
Wow. Overrated! Have you been here when you haven't waited 45 minutes for a table and that's only the beginning of your wait? The french toast (oh stuffed with brie, how crazy!) is NOT THAT GOOD. Sheesh. For their prices to not include any accompaniments is crazy. I mean good for them for continuing to charge exhorbitant prices and providing really bad service and food at the same time. Plus is a really inviting, cute atmosphere. They could vastly improve by making their food quicker, better, etc., though.
I heard a lot about this cafe before, like it's the best place to have brunch in the whole town. Also, last time we couldn't even get in because of the long line. All these has built up a very high expectation for this visit. The food was great but it just very pricy for brunch. And portion of the most food is very small for this high price. The brie stuffed french toast was very impressive. The toast was giant and the whole plate was filled with syrup with blueberry sauce! It's taste great but just too heavy for me. The strata was okay, and I actually liked the side salad better than the strata itself.
As far as Ithaca "brunch" food goes, this place is the best. The vietnamese fusion style bahn mi is great, the stuffed french toast is fantastic, and the homemade bread is amazing. At one point you could buy their bread like a bakery, but they weren't doing this the last time I stopped by :(. The service is friendly and professional and the restaurant is very accommodating if you have special requests.
Brie-stuffed french toast.  Need I say more?  No, but I will.  Brie-stuffed french toast!!!
I've been here once for breakfast and it was a very satisfying experience. The food is delicious and the service was very attentive and entertaining complete with a little bit of snark! I hope to come back soon.
Great place for brunch!  Deeeeelicious! Went with a group of 8 coworkers.  I had the brioche french toast with a side of bacon and it was great.  Several coworkers also had that and enjoyed it.  Some had omelets that they were also happy with.  Service was prompt and the tea is "real tea" (not bagged). The stuffed scones look AMAZING - had I not been stuffed I would have indulged. Cute decor with antique cameras and posters. Next time I plan to get the smoked salmon... and maybe a scone.
SO delicious. Everything here was creative and even better than it seemed on the menu. The garlic-crusted home fries came with a light, homemade tomato ginger sauce and were way better than regular potato breakfast products. The brie-stuffed French toast served with maple syrup and raspberry sauce/jam was perfect --so sweet but also substantive, thick chewy bread with enough melty cheese inside to flavor the dish but not overwhelm the (deceptive) lightness. Then we ordered the breakfast special, which is the only report tempeh dish I've ever enjoyed. Not sure why I ordered it, but I loved the tempeh, a soft brown rice/apple flavored square topped with a tomato slice and fresh poached egg. The mate tea was so flavorful. Overall, a great dining experience that made up for the highly disappointing dinner at the storied Moosewood. Go here if you're in Ithaca!
The best words I can use to describe this restaurant are oh em gee! Everytime I have come to the carriage house I have been blown away! My favorite dishes are the rabbit sausage, the Buffalo sausage, and the brie stuffed french toast. All of these dishes are beyond amazing! In addition the carriage house serves drinks that any barista would be proud to call his own. The restaurant is small and often crowded. Which can be frustrating and make you want to give up, but I assure you it is more than worth the wait! There is a rotating menu of daily specials and the Saturday and Sunday brunch is not to be missed. I highly recommend that any visitor to the city visit the carriage  house at least once! If there is a drawback, it would be inconsistency among chefs. When ordering the French toast sometimes it's served with a drizzle of raspberry sauce, and other times it's served in a sea. But besides this small issue, the restaurant is amazing.
Scrumptious breakfast, just down the hill from collegetown.  This was my absolute favorite place for Sunday brunch in Ithaca.  If you only go once and try one thing, get the Brie-stuffed French toast.  It's very simply, exactly what the name implies, lightly coated with real maple syrup (none of that Aunt Jemima crud).  The Niman Farms bacon goes well with the french toast, and their cappuccinos are as tasty as any in ithaca, topped with a nice bit of foam-art. The restaurant is situated in an old carriage house (duh!), and the interior remains mostly unfinished.  The walls are exposed brick and rafters jut across the ceiling; tables are sparse and mostly glass-topped affairs, some of which are made from old converted domestic equipment, e.g. over-sized foot-peddle-operated sewing machines.  The walls and shelves are adorned with old memorabilia and board games.  Due to the small number of tables, if you show up at a busy time, you might have to wait 20-30 minutes for a table; you can always head down the street to the ABC if you can't stand to wait. The food is kinda pricey, especially for college students who would rather spend their cash at Rulloff's, Stella or Johnnie O's.  From what I understand, after taking a salary for himself, the owner gives the proceeds to charity, which is cool, but doesn't stop the sting on my pocketbook.  Slightly cheaper and they would get five stars.
Went here for breakfast and the food was very good, though a little pricey for some items.  Portions were filling and I would return.
The sconewich was amazing. We got a table right away in the very cozy dining room. Service was very good... Try the buffalo sausage.
I had the rabbit patè, it was very good and I enjoyed that. However, we had been scouting this place for weeks prior to our visit and I had my heart set on the Banh Mi.  They were out of chicken. Bummer. I do like the decor and the food was great.  The coffee is awful.
I have never had a bad meal here.  Not only have I been happy with each successive new menu item I try, my expectations are continually shattered by this establishment's culinary expertise. Hands down one of the best restaurants in Ithaca.  If they served lunch and dinner I would be hard pressed to suggest a better restaurant. Bravo.
So it was a busy Sunday morning and my first time at the Carriage House.  The hostess greeted me and my girlfriend with a smile and indicated to us that it would be a 30 min wait; no problem!  I meandered over to the coffee bar area and took a quick read of the Carriage House self published photo book which was filled with great photos and brief history of the house.  After some time I noticed tables opening up and really no one being seated in them and it turns out the hostess forgot about our table which of course is kinda annoying.  We were seated and it took at least 10 minutes for our server to come over and greet us in a very faint voice which I could barely understand.  I felt as if I was in another dimension at times with the flakiness of the staff! With our hunger growing we quickly ordered some coffee which was strong but a bit bitter and our brunch as I didn't want to waste anymore time.  The scenery was nice and the decor accommodating to the motif of this historic house.  There was a stone wall and a bunch of I guess farming decor throughout the place.  Anyway, our food came out quite promptly.  I ordered the Sconewhich, which is scrambled egg w/ NYS cheddar cheese inside a griddled ham and cheese scone.  I must say this was like something I had never had!  Super delicious and full of flavor, the scone really put the finishing touches on the whole meal and cannot image it without it! A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! All in all in was a nice experience the natural light coming in on this sunny late morning through the beautiful windows and the wonderful food made up a bit for the dumb and checked out waitstaff!  Who knows maybe they all fell down and hit their heads on the concrete before coming to work?!?! Go for the food and decor and be sure to make crazy concentrated eye contact with the staff to get you seated and your first cup of coffee! Cheers!
Like many a New Yorker I have quested for the perfect burger from in and out and shake shack chain burgers to upscale dbgb and steakhouse burgers. Too bad I discovered it at carriage house cafe in Ithaca NY. A beefy juiciness perhaps from brisket? All local beef. The meat has a mouthfeel and a bounce that echoes the chewy bread, like a perfect Baguette. The juicy flavor is echoed again by the sun dried tomato aioli and grilled onions without any heavy grease. It is amazingly composed and easy to eat with your hands (so many burgers fall apart) and always garnished with just a perfect bit of barely dressed salad. Unfortunately that always leaves little room for their scones which are also great.
The place is cute. The services are great. I would recommend this place.
UNIQUE BREAKFAST PLACE. Yes the burger is good. Its not a burger place though, and it stands only with the Reuben as the only things I can remember I might go back to have for LUNCH. Pricing must be OK, because I did not think anything was over priced, and I can't exactly remember the price, my date paid, so I was not paying much attention, although I looked at the menu. Unique breakfast items. Very Tasty and everything was quality. Service was fantastic. Ambiance - kind of like a place two old ladies might go or sorority girls will take their Mom's for breakfast for lunch. Perhaps some others will get some hangover-cure French toast. Its in an old carriage house, with lots of exposed stone, and lush gardens and flowers outside - very appealing. BUT, there should be more people here! A line! There aren't droves of people standing in line Saturday mornings to get their scones or French Toast or people lining up to get the burgers, and that is what the place SHOULD BE - albeit with a waiting list, and people properly dressed on good behavior.  It was crowded, so I am sure the cafe still does very well. Maybe I was there at the wrong time. Suggestions - another sandwich..or two. Chicken Pesto? Honey Ham with brie? or even some type of artisanal cheeses - maybe with a glass of fingerlakes wine? I'd much rather buy a unique awesome sandwich here than at Ithaca Bakery! Enough people seemed to be in there enjoying the uniqueness that the Cafe is doing well, but the menu is small and I always want something that is not on it.
One of the best brunch options in Ithaca, evident by the ridiculous wait on weekends; however, as a brunch fanatic, I think Carriage House is slightly overrated, though it's still very good. Carriage House service is adequately courteous and prompt to get you in and out (so people waiting can get seated at your table before your chair turns cold). The coffee is rich, smooth, and flavorful (they make a killer cappuccino), and the fresh squeezed juice are wonderful. For your first time, you must try the Brie-stuffed french toast. For additional visits, be sure to ask your server for the breakfast specials of the day -- they're usually creative and tasty. While waiting for your meal or after you pay the check, make sure to take note of the lovely decor, and take a peek at the beautiful loft upstairs before you head out! Note: They're closed on Mondays!
My fiancé and I were in town for the weekend and stopped in for brunch. I had the Brie stuffed French Toast Special and oh. my. god. it was DELICIOUS.   The brie between the french toast was not overpowering and didn't make the dish taste too brie-y. On top of the french toast were berries and chopped pieces of ham (?) which I felt was an excellent touch as it added that hint of saltiness to this otherwise sweet dish. Also, I don't usually eat syrup with my pancakes or french toast but the plate was in somewhat of a pool of syrup. I actually thought the syrup complimented the dish very well as the bread was thick enough not to be saturated in it. There was also an option to have this dish with a poached egg on top for an additional cost. The decor of the cafe was also very cool and the wait staff was very attentive. Prior to being seated we had a 20 minute wait where we just grabbed an americano and mochachino and sat in an additional seating space (probably for private parties?) with a few tables as well as a fireplace on the second floor. If I am ever in the Fingerlakes area again, I will definitely be retuning for brunch!
Fantabulous place for Sunday morning hangover (or not) brunch. Super cute place that reminds of you one of those adorable little cabin restaurants that you go to after an afternoon of skiing (or something like that). The price is reasonable for what they give you and the food is delicious. I definitely still have to try their brie-stuffed french toast. The only downside is that the wait can be pretty long if you go during peak hours (i.e. Sunday brunch hours). My group had to wait about 45 min-1 hr the last time we went. Also, parking can be somewhat inconvenient. They have a tiny gravel lot in front that can fit 3 cars; unless you're lucky, you have to find street parking nearby. But it's so worth it.
The wait to get a seat for brunch on the weekend is pretty bad, but it is so worth it. I've been here at least 3-4 times and I think it's to die for. The restaurant's decor is adorable and quaint and cozy. It feels like you're in a little lodge. Their coffee is fabulous and it comes with fresh tasting cream. Alternatively, they have good espresso drinks (cappuccino is my fav) that come with little designs in the foam. :) I always have to get the Brie stuffed French toast, which is as good as it sounds and the portion is almost unmanageably big unless you're starving. Comes with maple syrup and berry coulis. The omelet of the day is my usual other go-to, I'll get that and the French toast and split with my dining partner. The omelet is always smaller and is accompanied by two little biscotti-sized pieces of fresh buttered toast. Sometimes they have specials if you check in on Foursquare. Give it a shot, I got a free cappuccino the first time I checked in. You will not be disappointed with this place.
I've only been there once, so this review is based on only one lunch.  I had my doubts when we entered, because it seemed a bit like the place was in chaos.  I think they were training new people and the place was very busy, which seemed to be stretching the capacity of the waitstaff and kitchen.  It looked like some people had been waiting quite a while for their lunches. Fortunately for me, we seemed to have gotten there at just the right time and our lunches came quickly.  Based only on my lunch, a burger, I would give 5 stars.  It was made with grass-fed beef and it was delicious.  It also had cheddar and sundried tomatoes and I think it was on focaccia bread.  It really was one of the tastiest burgers I've ever had.  I would say it was a little undercooked (I asked for medium and there was some significant redness left).  My girlfriend had some sandwich that was okay, but absolutely soaked in oil.  She did say that the burger was likely THE tastiest burger she had ever had.
Best breakfast out I've ever had. Everything was prepared to perfection.  I've NEVER had that happen before.   French toast with fruit compote and real maple syrup. Homemade local sausage with hint of chorizo flavoring. Garlic crusted homefries with homemade ginger ketchup. Fresh OJ. Finally, my tea: I drink green tea, which 99% of the time is wrong if you don't make it yourself.  I might say that their's was a touch strong, but quite delicious which made this a 5 star affair.
Kinda pricey for the portions. They have solid offerings for small town Ithaca but they probably won't stand a chance in a big city.
I came to visit a friend at Cornell this past weekend, and because she knew that I'm a pretty big foodie and Yelper, she took me here since it's her favorite spot for brunch. First of all, I've got to say that I love the atmosphere. I could definitely see myself going on a date with someone here or even just spending the early day studying there. There's a decent variety of drink options. As for the food, definitely on the costly side, but you can definitely see the effort that's put into the food. The quality of the food that's served is phenomenal--I ordered a simple breakfast sandwich with ham, egg, and cheese. It was served on some pretty yummy toast, and according to my friend, they make everything here fresh so that's always a nice perk. We also tried out the home fries in Carriage House's very own ketchup that I found to be unique and decent. The fries were more like regular potatoes, but they weren't bad. Service is great and ambience is great, so I'm a fan. tldr; come for good brunch!
If I went to college in Ithaca, the Carriage House is the kind of place that I would visit when the parents are in town. ;) We got there early for a weekend brunch since it seemed like the kind of place that fills up fast, which it did. Nearly everyone in our party went with the Omelet special (goat cheese, spinach, sweet potato) and were not disappointed. They had an excellent selection of teas, as well. It's hard to get overly-enthusiastic about brunch, but if you can score a table, the Carriage House should not be missed.
My sister and I lucked out on a Sunday around 1:30PM. We were told it was going to be a 15 minute wait, which we were fine with, but it ended up being only 5 minutes if that! The staff is great and the food here is okay. We had mimosas to start which were very weak. The brie stuffed french toast was decent (although did not live up to its hype) and the vegetarian grilled sandwich was decent. They give you a good amount of food for the price and the place is cute and cozy. For Ithaca, it's a good restaurant. In general, however, it's an okay restaurant.
Barista extraordinaire Chris Deferio delivers the most amazing espresso drinks along with Gimme coffee French pressed to order, and amazing food featuring unique flavor combinations. The caf portion is open all day most days to just pop in for a coffee to go. The brunch menu is unfortunately fairly static, but exquisite- yummy scrambled eggs with your choice of 4 cheeses (I got sharp white cheddar). Ridiculously good French toast - 2 big slabs of bread with a solid layer of brie between, covered in a swirl of maple syrup and raspberry coulis (this doesn't sound like it would necessarily be good to me, but trust me, it's a good match). Pretty good design inside, though I would have to call it clean modern meets old carriage house (with them here) plus a dash of Southern Living (huh?) thrown in (which is to say not perfect). Definitely a foodie place; you will most likely have to wait and there will be some unique (but very good) foods and / or combinations, but if you are into food it is well worth it.
Ordered 8 items to go and they forgot one and wouldn't deliver to us. They gave us credit but we were still unhappy about it. The strata was flavorless and had small portions. The Vietnamese BBQ sandwich was good.
This place is a must when you're in Ithaca. Brie stuffed french toast was excellent, coffee was good except not free refill ;) Love the interior with vintage-antique decorations, more in the pricey side but worth it.
So to start off, I wanted to dock this place another star due to the prices but the meal I ordered makes this place deserving of 4 stars. I went for lunch with a friend 45 minutes before they closed and the server was very accommodating and still let us sit in for some lunch as I've been wanting to try this place so badly for a while now. The atmosphere is very cool, very homey and it really makes you think that you really aren't in Ithaca for the moment which was very cool. The place was a bit small and the tables are glass so be careful coming here if you have children. The server was nice, took our drink order and our lunch order and it came out within 15 minutes which is standard and is good, It gave my friend and I some time to talk which was nice. I like when food is fast but being too fast defeats the purpose of going out sometimes. Anyways I ordered the Banh Mi. This was my 2nd ever Banh Mi so I don't have a good comparison for this yet but let me tell you, this won my sandwich of the month and maybe year award! The bread was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside which is my favorite way to have it especially when eating a sandwich. They piled so much teriyaki bbq chicken on this sandwich it was literally falling out, which i liked because usually they skimp on the meats. The cabbage, cilantro, sweet chili sauce, and chili mayo were amazing accompaniments to this sandwich and the flavors were just astounding. Sweet yet a little kick with that cilantro to really bring in that herby taste. Then the crunch of the cabbage to complement the soft chicken. They really got this one right let me tell you. This was and is easily the best Banh Mi I've had yet and will now use this as the comparisons for others which is going to be a tough one to beat I think. My friend got the burger which I almost got. This is another reason they get notched a star. Now people know me as the burger guy, and my friend is just as picky as I am. The burger was small and the entire size of everything with the burger was half as big as my Banh Mi. He said he would've eaten two of them and he's a small guy. They had cheese and onions on it but very little tomato puree and no lettuce. To me a burger needs toppers. Since when do people think that putting meat and a sauce with onions on a bun is a burger? Are you people taking crazy pills? Burgers were meant to have toppings, they live for toppings. You need a crunch when eating a burger so just a pile of bread and meat which is mush in your mouth.This is really disappointing because as I ordered my sandwich I was thinking "Next time I'ma gonna try that burger!" and now....I will definitely not. He said the meat was really tender, cooked to his liking and had flavor but come on. It was meat on a bun pretty much. No one likes that. Overall I would come back here but not often as lunch for the two of us which just consisted of water and 2 meals came to almost $30. This is a place that maybe every few months I would come back to for a Banh Mi and I do want to try it for brunch. If the prices were $1-$2 less on everything I think they would draw others in more often and I would definitely return more. I recommend you try this place but you'll definitely agree this won't be your go to lunch place, you'll be broke haha.
Wow oh wow, to put it simply, Carriage House is tasty. There's something special about this place I can't really put my hands on. There are few amazing restaurants in the ithaca area, and Carriage House is just one of them. I was honestly debating whether or not I was going to put this down as a four star or a five star, but just decided to put it down as a four star. The downsides to Carriage House though are the really high prices and the ridiculous waiting time for the food to come out. Despite this, the atmosphere is really quaint and comfortable, the food presentation and taste is out of this world, and there simply is no better place to get brunch in this area. Go with brie stuffed french toast, breakfast sandwich, reuben, and burger.
My friend and I went here for a late brunch, and if anything makes me wish I lived in Ithaca, it's the Carriage House. I love the decor; it's eclectic and a little funky.  Our "table" was actually an ancient stove accessorized with a carefully placed stack of old LPs. We both ordered the brie-stuffed french toast and garlic home fries.  Unbelievable.  The food actually inspired me to take a photo and post it on Facebook so all of my friends could be jealous.  :)  The french toast was flavorful and chewy, and the brie was skillfully melted.  The home fries were perfectly savory. We did hit one snag - my home fries came out with our entrees, but my friend's side dish took an extra 10 minutes or so to get to the table.  Our server was nice about it and took it off the check, though.  We absolutely loved our brunch. A couple things to keep in mind: - They charge for coffee refills, which I think is kind of lame.  I think it's something like 85 cents per refill. - Get here either super early, or at the end of brunch (and I'm repeating what our server told us).  They don't take reservations, and the waiting list can sometimes stretch to two hours.   - Like many small restaurants, the Carriage House is closed Mondays. Enjoy!
Oh my god! AMAZING! We came here for brunch on the last day of our trip and everything was phenomenal! We had the brooches french toast...to die for.  The home fries were outstanding...and seriously the best bacon and sausage ever. They were very accommodating for our large group. The coffee was strong but good....a MUST stop if your in Ithaca.
Great ambiance- but don't come there for the weekend brunch unless you're prepared.  It can get noisy and crowded.   Definitely: come here for pastries and coffee/tea any other time of day.  It is a fabulous place to sit and chat with friends.
The Brie-stuffed French toast is out of this world. This is coming from someone that absolutely hates the overly sugar saturated generic french toasts! A must try. Needless to say our whole party clean finished their plates.
There are very few places that I like to meet up with friends and brunch at here in Ithaca, NY, but The Carriage House Cafe is one of them. Its rustic, yet cozy decor is quite stunning. As much as it is a space intended for a moderately sized group, the Cafe is private and comfortable enough to accomodate you by your lonesome or two. The menu and diverse food selections are where its at. I've sampled two of their house specialties: the smoked salmon plate with fig as well as their infamous, brie stuffed french toast lightly drenched with a berry puree. Both entrees, extremely well made, delivered every time I've ordered them. While the cafe does provide the usual brunch beverages, like mimosas, they are unfortunately not unlimited. This is a minor shortcoming on the cafe's menu for a mimosa lover like me. The chai lattes, however, do make up for that, especially on a blustering, winter morning. Waitering service is, at times, a mixed bag. My friends and I have been exposed to both ends of the extreme--either too attentive or too negligent and impersonal. Among the other, top brunch contenders (Stella and Ruloff's) in Collegetown, Carriage House stands out with its classic and mouth-watering entrees.
This place has really grown on me. The building was going through restoration the year I graduated, so ours has been a post-collegiate affair (slope days and other Ithaca treks). At first, I outright rejected the decor--seems a bit out of place, juxtaposed with Chappy and ABC. But it has grown on me, exacerbated by my girlfriend's special affinity for the magazines and glass tables. My feelings about it are this: They serve Gimme! coffee, and they take the time to make a pretty leaf thing in the foam. I like the pretty leaf thing. When I was 22, I would have screamed "yuppie scum!", shattered the mug on the wall above a perplexed barista's head, and headed-over for some Black Forest and 4-day-old popcorn across the street. Now, steeped in the mellowness of the mid-to-late 20s, latte art makes me tingly. They're open breakfast through dinner and beyond; that's a plus when you're dropping into I-town at weird, in-between meal times, as I'm known to do by the eight people who know me. I can speak nothing of their busy times or their more substantial offerings; I go for the coffee and the sweet stuff, and those alone. And I like their windows. Lead pane-y.
Great place with delicious food and friendly staff! I got brie stuffed french toast, Latte and Yerba Mate tea and all were delicious! It has cute outdoor sitting surrounded by flowers :) and inside is also very nice + they have comfy couches if you want to go for a tea or coffee only :)!
Living in ithaca for almost three years, must say, this is one of the top 3 restaurants for me in ithaca. Love the ambience, the food is honest and delicious. The moment you walk into the restaurant and smell the freshly baked baguette, I'm sold already.... They used to have dinners as well before, but they stopped doing that unfortunately. I would recommend the burger. I believe its grass fed beef served over ciabatta. It's a bit small compared to regular burgers, but absolutely fantastic. Although the last two times  I've been ordering brie french toast which is also amazing! The fish cakes are also great, sausages, salads are also good. Hard to go wrong really as they have a small menu but they do everything in that menu well. Finally, you have to have the coffee. I'm told that the barista won consecutive awards in coffee contest. What he/she does with the cream to design the frothe in your coffee is genius! Every coffee looks like art. And tastes great by the way.
Great atmosphere & location, very friendly staff! Pumpkin soup was delicious, Omlet of the day and breakfast sandwich were def yummy, but nothing super special (considering the price)- apparently the brie stuffed french toast is what's draws people in for breakfast. I would absolutely recommend visiting, maybe try lunch next time... they had some appetizing options! Coffee, tea, pastries & wine + atmosphere here are a given must!
We went in for lunch while we were in town last week. Every thing on their brunch/lunch menu looked great. I finally settled for the Vietnamese sandwich and it was fantastic!! The BF had their Ruben sandwich which he thought was great as well. If only there was a Carriage House Cafe in DC...
Decent brunch food in Ithaca. No complaints about the food there. We had the sconewhich which was a scone with cheese and egg which was very tasty. The scone was a savory scone with sausage, buttery and flaky. Also ordered the Brie stuffed brioche toast, interesting combination however would be nice if there was more Brie. Apple cider mimosa was like a cider beer. Pretty good!
Needless to say, good place for Sunday brunch. Amazing ambience although can be a little loud, had the classic breakfast choice, not mindblowing but still pretty nice. Good coffee!
Group of 8 of us went here over reunion weekend for  some mildly hungover brunch. This place was great! Food was all delicious, fresh and very reasonably priced. Coffee was great (said the coffee drinkers at the table) and drinks were happily refilled as we needed it. I had the strata of the day which was divine, people loved the omelette, and the sconewiches were gobbled up. Easily would come back here next time we're in town.
I love this place. On both occasions I ordered an omelette. Both times it came with unusual but tasty, vegetarian ingredients. The first time my homemade grain toast was a little too "toasted" for my liking but that was a minor thing. The second time I substituted a small salad & it was delicious. Excellent Brooklyn-roasted, french press coffee. A lovely, efficient waitress, Alexis, on both occasions gave me great, suggestions for other dining options. She knows I will keep coming back to Carriage House, she wasn't steering me away! Lovely ambiance, too. And a stone's throw from my daughter's dorm.
We had brunch at the Carriage House for the first time today. It is cozy and quaint, with a lot of exposed fieldstone and rustic antiques. According to our local friend, it really was an actual carriage house back in the 1850s (hooray for history!). I feel like all they need is a working fireplace, a genial grandmother, and some labrador retrievers to really nail the slice-of-country-in-the-city atmosphere. We got there right at noon, so we expected a wait. We passed the 30-ish minutes with our coffee upstairs in the hayloft, but there are a few chairs and benches outside as well if the weather is nice. What can I say about the amazing brie-stuffed French toast besides GET IN MAH MOUTH. As I was stuffing my face, I noticed that everyone else's orders--the breakfast sandwich, the Carriage House burger, and the curry and beet salad--looked delicious as well. My only complaint is that our waitress disappeared from the time she served our food to the time she cleared our plates, so our water glasses were empty for half the meal. Otherwise, it was a fantastic experience and we will definitely be back.
REALLY enjoyed the salmon plate (him) and the strata (me). The tea was freshly brewed, both his iced tea and my hot tea. The service was good, the staff very friendly. Loved it!
This place had a great atmosphere, but be prepared to wait. Omelet of the day was tasty... Onion, artichoke, sundried tomatoes and parm cheese. Yummy. Latte was good but not very strong
I heard a lot about this cafe before, like it's the best place to have brunch in the whole town. Also, last time we couldn't even get in because of the long line. All these has built up a very high expectation for this visit. The food was great but it just very pricy for brunch. And portion of the most food is very small for this high price. The brie stuffed french toast was very impressive. The toast was giant and the whole plate was filled with syrup with blueberry sauce! It's taste great but just too heavy for me. The strata was okay, and I actually liked the side salad better than the strata itself.
So when I order my mainstay, must-have items from Carriage House, I will give it 5 stars every single time. However, there are some items on the menu that aren't to my taste. Usually it's all a matter of preference. For me, that means savory over sweet. If you've got a huge sweet tooth and love Brie, of course you should go for the Brie-stuffed French toast. Have their raspberry scone with your mochaccino. Try the specials- they almost always have some unique twist on a strata, fresh sorbet mimosas, and entrees that incorporate seasonal ingredients. And I love their Vietnamese Banh Mi, raspberry scones, mocha, strata, garlic-battered home fries with their tomato-ginger ketchup, salads, Reuben, burger, and specials. They're all drool-worthy. What I don't love... the Brie-stuffed French toast, though that's understandable. I love Brie, but I'm not a big fan of super-saccharine things. I was hesitant to try it. Even my waitress thought I wouldn't really like it, and suggested I get something more savory. But I wanted to step outside my comfort zone, and didn't listen, so now I'm left with a craving for their Banh Mi...The grilled cheese and pesto is good, but not great. For $10, it's really not worth it. Their salmon plate and other breakfast items are good, but nothing to write home about. The worst, though, is the Braised Short Rib, the new item on the menu. The short rib  was quite bland. There were gross pieces of tendon and cartilage in it. The rapini and white bean hummus were weird additions, to say the least. The rapini was bitter and fibrous, as rapini always is. The white bean hummus was bland and creamy. The cheese and bread were good. All of those ingredients mixed together were too much: the flavors and textures clashed so that I was tasting each individual (not-so-nice) component rather than a delicious mix of everything. Anyway, even with that one train wreck of a menu item, and their very high prices, I still love Carriage House and will always return to it whenever I'm in the area. The items I listed up there in my second paragraph are really just THAT good. Oh, and bonus points for the ambience, especially in the late Spring to Summer when all the flowers are in bloom.
As far as Ithaca "brunch" food goes, this place is the best. The vietnamese fusion style bahn mi is great, the stuffed french toast is fantastic, and the homemade bread is amazing. At one point you could buy their bread like a bakery, but they weren't doing this the last time I stopped by :(. The service is friendly and professional and the restaurant is very accommodating if you have special requests.
I would eat at the Carriage House five times a week if someone would take me there!  Best brunch anywhere, best fresh scones and baked goods that you can watch disappear from the bakery case while you read the Times and sip your Americano on a weekend morning.  Really nice staff, great chef Kristian.  And all in a beautifully renovated carriage house with gorgeous gardens.  Highly recommended!
Brie-stuffed french toast.  Need I say more?  No, but I will.  Brie-stuffed french toast!!!
We had lunch here the other day before we dropped off our daughter at a sports camp. We had high hopes for some great sandwiches and/or breakfast items based on the descriptions and reviews we had read.  We are also suckers for homemade bread!  The interior of the cafe is really cute, since it really is an old carriage house.  It is decorated nicely and has original stone walls.   Each of us ordered a sandwich - grilled cheese pesto, salmon LT, and the chicken bahn mi.  First of all let me say the bread they are on is probably very good, but unfortunately it is overpowered by SALT and way too much sauce.   The flavor of the bread cannot come through because of all of the sauce or whatever condiment is on the sandwich.  My smoked salmon was so salty that I must have drunk a gallon of water the rest of the day.  I expected lox which is salty, but really, it was WAY too salty.  My daughter's grilled cheese was also overly salty.  This place is overpriced for what they serve and the quality of the food.  We expected much better and were disappointed.  Skip this place and find somewhere else to eat.
I've been here once for breakfast and it was a very satisfying experience. The food is delicious and the service was very attentive and entertaining complete with a little bit of snark! I hope to come back soon.
I completely agree with Lanie... I had heard so many great things about their brunch, but was completely underwhelmed. Sure, it has a lovely interior which my 85-year-old grandmother would absolutely ADORE, but the wait, the service, the prices... too much for what turned out to be too little. Limited menu, small portions, mediocre meal. Might as well hop across the road to ABC cafe, where they have similar fare (but a lot more selection, especially for vegetarians), with better service, bigger portions, reasonable prices and room to breathe! Plus, half the wait and a much more pleasant experience overall.
Great place for brunch!  Deeeeelicious! Went with a group of 8 coworkers.  I had the brioche french toast with a side of bacon and it was great.  Several coworkers also had that and enjoyed it.  Some had omelets that they were also happy with.  Service was prompt and the tea is "real tea" (not bagged). The stuffed scones look AMAZING - had I not been stuffed I would have indulged. Cute decor with antique cameras and posters. Next time I plan to get the smoked salmon... and maybe a scone.
I will have to go against the grain here and say that this place is hyped up more than is warranted (don't hate on me for this!).  The thing is, the food was prepared well and tasty, but not exclusively so.  The menu selections were nice and the portion size was more than ample.  Price was well within the range for the servings.  The problem for me was in the environment.  The first chair I sat it was so rickety that I thought it might break so I changed it out.  Second one was the same: I could rock back and forth in it.  To call the atmosphere rustic would be doing "rustic" a disservice. It almost has the feel of sitting on a picnic bench at the park.  Still...the food is good enough that I may go back.  I wonder if they have take out...
SO delicious. Everything here was creative and even better than it seemed on the menu. The garlic-crusted home fries came with a light, homemade tomato ginger sauce and were way better than regular potato breakfast products. The brie-stuffed French toast served with maple syrup and raspberry sauce/jam was perfect --so sweet but also substantive, thick chewy bread with enough melty cheese inside to flavor the dish but not overwhelm the (deceptive) lightness. Then we ordered the breakfast special, which is the only report tempeh dish I've ever enjoyed. Not sure why I ordered it, but I loved the tempeh, a soft brown rice/apple flavored square topped with a tomato slice and fresh poached egg. The mate tea was so flavorful. Overall, a great dining experience that made up for the highly disappointing dinner at the storied Moosewood. Go here if you're in Ithaca!
Carriage House is charming and delivers a solid brunch. It is conveniently located near Cornell, and is often bustling with students and Ithacans alike. I used to frequent there with friends during my undergraduate, and we were always pleased but neer wowed. The farmer's breakfast was good and the toast was always delicious.
The best words I can use to describe this restaurant are oh em gee! Everytime I have come to the carriage house I have been blown away! My favorite dishes are the rabbit sausage, the Buffalo sausage, and the brie stuffed french toast. All of these dishes are beyond amazing! In addition the carriage house serves drinks that any barista would be proud to call his own. The restaurant is small and often crowded. Which can be frustrating and make you want to give up, but I assure you it is more than worth the wait! There is a rotating menu of daily specials and the Saturday and Sunday brunch is not to be missed. I highly recommend that any visitor to the city visit the carriage  house at least once! If there is a drawback, it would be inconsistency among chefs. When ordering the French toast sometimes it's served with a drizzle of raspberry sauce, and other times it's served in a sea. But besides this small issue, the restaurant is amazing.
I do not consider Carriage House Cafe a go-to place for brunch.  They have a paltry number of vegetarian options.  Most of those are cheese or cream-based.  They did not seem to cater to vegans at all. The very limited menu was dominated by meats and creamy dishes.   I have also eaten lunch there and was not happy with the quality or quantity of food for the price.  Very flavorless and mediocre. The atmosphere is pretty nice but it's hectic and noisy for brunch.   I think Cafe DeWitt does a better job and has a wider range of food for comparable prices (but the portions are larger) and the food is very consistently perfectly cooked.  So, I'd opt for Cafe DeWit instead for a flawless brunch with high-quality ingredients (although Cafe DeWit is an odd location in the middle of DeWit mall).
Scrumptious breakfast, just down the hill from collegetown.  This was my absolute favorite place for Sunday brunch in Ithaca.  If you only go once and try one thing, get the Brie-stuffed French toast.  It's very simply, exactly what the name implies, lightly coated with real maple syrup (none of that Aunt Jemima crud).  The Niman Farms bacon goes well with the french toast, and their cappuccinos are as tasty as any in ithaca, topped with a nice bit of foam-art. The restaurant is situated in an old carriage house (duh!), and the interior remains mostly unfinished.  The walls are exposed brick and rafters jut across the ceiling; tables are sparse and mostly glass-topped affairs, some of which are made from old converted domestic equipment, e.g. over-sized foot-peddle-operated sewing machines.  The walls and shelves are adorned with old memorabilia and board games.  Due to the small number of tables, if you show up at a busy time, you might have to wait 20-30 minutes for a table; you can always head down the street to the ABC if you can't stand to wait. The food is kinda pricey, especially for college students who would rather spend their cash at Rulloff's, Stella or Johnnie O's.  From what I understand, after taking a salary for himself, the owner gives the proceeds to charity, which is cool, but doesn't stop the sting on my pocketbook.  Slightly cheaper and they would get five stars.
All time favourite.
Went here for breakfast and the food was very good, though a little pricey for some items.  Portions were filling and I would return.
I don't understand all the positive reviews for this place. The one star is for the lovely antique carriage house building itself. The food is appalling. It's way overpriced, it came to our table cold, and some items were inedible. The $4 sausage has a bizarre and off-putting flavor that made it impossible to eat. The eggs have a weird texture that made me wonder if they were from a carton of pasteurized egg liquid. The bacon is petrified and so hard it might break your fillings. The french toast comes to the table burned.
The sconewich was amazing. We got a table right away in the very cozy dining room. Service was very good... Try the buffalo sausage.
Excellent food and great atmosphere!
I have never had a bad meal here.  Not only have I been happy with each successive new menu item I try, my expectations are continually shattered by this establishment's culinary expertise. Hands down one of the best restaurants in Ithaca.  If they served lunch and dinner I would be hard pressed to suggest a better restaurant. Bravo.
Like many a New Yorker I have quested for the perfect burger from in and out and shake shack chain burgers to upscale dbgb and steakhouse burgers. Too bad I discovered it at carriage house cafe in Ithaca NY. A beefy juiciness perhaps from brisket? All local beef. The meat has a mouthfeel and a bounce that echoes the chewy bread, like a perfect Baguette. The juicy flavor is echoed again by the sun dried tomato aioli and grilled onions without any heavy grease. It is amazingly composed and easy to eat with your hands (so many burgers fall apart) and always garnished with just a perfect bit of barely dressed salad. Unfortunately that always leaves little room for their scones which are also great.
I needed to find a cafe that my family & I could grab brunch at in addition to being close to the waterfalls. This place had great reviews & the location & atmosphere seemed to fit our moods, so we tried it out. I am so glad that we did.. The food was excellent, the service was quick. I highly recommend this place for anyone visiting from out of town, or those that like that old cottage feel (this place has that). I can't wait to come back!
UNIQUE BREAKFAST PLACE. Yes the burger is good. Its not a burger place though, and it stands only with the Reuben as the only things I can remember I might go back to have for LUNCH. Pricing must be OK, because I did not think anything was over priced, and I can't exactly remember the price, my date paid, so I was not paying much attention, although I looked at the menu. Unique breakfast items. Very Tasty and everything was quality. Service was fantastic. Ambiance - kind of like a place two old ladies might go or sorority girls will take their Mom's for breakfast for lunch. Perhaps some others will get some hangover-cure French toast. Its in an old carriage house, with lots of exposed stone, and lush gardens and flowers outside - very appealing. BUT, there should be more people here! A line! There aren't droves of people standing in line Saturday mornings to get their scones or French Toast or people lining up to get the burgers, and that is what the place SHOULD BE - albeit with a waiting list, and people properly dressed on good behavior.  It was crowded, so I am sure the cafe still does very well. Maybe I was there at the wrong time. Suggestions - another sandwich..or two. Chicken Pesto? Honey Ham with brie? or even some type of artisanal cheeses - maybe with a glass of fingerlakes wine? I'd much rather buy a unique awesome sandwich here than at Ithaca Bakery! Enough people seemed to be in there enjoying the uniqueness that the Cafe is doing well, but the menu is small and I always want something that is not on it.
Blown away by the Sconewich! So many delicious tastes in my mouth! Really cute yummy place. Definitely coming back! The French toast was also great, cooked to perfection. Not too expensive. Also I suggest trying the ketchup it's homemade!! Really tasty!
The food is all right, but expensive for the portions you get. At one point, we paid $5 for a small side of potatoes for brunch. Also, the service is only ok. We had a friend's birthday brunch here, and an extra person showed up. They acted like it was the end of the world and literally said they weren't sure they could seat the whole party because of this issue. They got it figured, but seriously...
Best brunch in town!
I really miss this place. While in Ithaca, it was one of my favorite spots: the space is gorgeous, and the food was good too. The also had the best Latte in town. There arent alot of things that I miss about Ithaca, but Carriage House is one of them (and Wegmans being another)
Great Saturday morning brunch at the quaint little cafe just off Cornell's campus.
Carriage House Cafe provides a great brunch!  Before going I consulted the YELP to see what people like here and I wasn't disappointed.  The Brie Stuffed French Toast was great! Really great (which says something because I was expecting not to like it).  I would say its only flaw is the fact that its over ten dollars for two pieces of bread, some brie in the middle and the berry puree.  Its really good and I'm glad I tried it but I certainly couldn't afford to get it if I frequented Carriage House.  The special (two eggs, two pieces of bacon and two pieces of toast) was pretty standard, but all high quality (especially the nice thick pieces of bacon that were still crispy).  As people said, the garlic home fries were awesome! Now they are the home fries that I compare all home fries to (and none seem to hold up).  The one dish that was a bit underwhelming was the sconewich.  I'm not sure what it was but something about the flavor didn't do it for me.  It wasn't bad, just not really what I am into and with so many great things to choose from there, I won't be ordering that again. Carriage House Cafe serves a great (but pricey) brunch.  I left full and content and would really like to go back.
The smoked salmon is a bit too salty for my taste, but the brie-stuffed French toast is an absolute must-try. The wait takes a long time though and they don't take reservations so be sure to arrive early in the morning if you want to be seated quickly.
My favorite casual place in Ithaca. I used to live just around the corner from here. Great food, great prices, portions on the small side though. Which means you and your date can split three plates rather than two for weekend brunch. All the better. Very friendly owner and staff. Coffee not that impressive but OK. Five stars for being among the best places in town.
another awesome brunch place. the sad part is that i discovered this place when I was about to leave Ithaca. Nevertheless, it's got one of the best brunch. And the coffee is just so good. I hope I do go back to Ithaca sometime, just do that I can have another good brunch here!
The Certified Humane "Smart Chicken" feels good and tastes great, too.
Worth every penny!
I was out in Ithaca for a job interview and only had a few hours to look around.  On my way to one of the waterfalls in the town I passed the Carriage House Cafe and stopped to take a picture because it was so cute outside. Unfortunately the waterfall access was closed, but the Carriage House was open.  The owner was there and chatted with me over some great coffee.  Unfortunately I will not be moving to Ithaca, but I am glad I stumbled upon this great little coffee shop.
We always come here on Sunday mornings for brunch, and make sure to arrive before they open at 9am.  It fills up quickly, so if you aren't in the first wave of seatings, it might be a bit of a wait.  That being said, they are always very quick to bring out food and drinks!  The brioche french toast is to die for, and their pancakes (when offered) are perfectly made.  The omelets can sometimes be a little iffy, so be careful when choosing those.  They have weird combinations of flavors that can be a bit off-putting.  Overall, a great place for a pretty affordable Sunday morning brunch!
Breakfast menu is unique, but they offer a few breakfast staples for the picky eaters...plating was simple, felt a bit empty/bare compared to typical breakfast eateries, but was great on taste!  Coffee was strong and bold, but refills weren't free which I normally expect...coffee was better than normal though making it worth it...Beautiful building, lots of charm.  Definitely worth checking out!
Amazing brunch food! Definitely will be coming back next time I am in town....thank you Danielle for introducing me to this place :)
Amazing brie-stuffed French toast!!
The Carriage house is great. We had our wedding rehearsal dinner here and Dominique made sure it went off without a hitch. The food and service are top-notch. Dominique gave us an incredible amount of flexibility with the menu and let us design the courses how we liked, which is extremely rare. No preset standardized chicken, beef, pork meals here, nope, you decide what you want to eat and they do the rest to make it an amazing experience. I'd strongly recommend to anyone with a small-to-medium sized party of 40-50-ish people who are looking for a high quality, memorable experience. Make sure to check out the upstairs loft while you're at it! P.S. All the posts *swooning* over the brie-stuffed french toast are true... I'm addicted... too bad I live 3,000 miles away.
Excellent food and service.   We went there twice for brunch and it was excellent.   They had about an hour wait for brunch though, but excellent, comfortable waiting areas.   My only recommendation to them would be to expand into their unused space as soon as possible!
Perhaps the best service I've ever had in a restaurant, even on the Saturday morning of Cornell visit weekend. Exceptionally good coffee, absolutely beautiful setting, and expertly prepared food. Absolutely worth the price; and if you want to go cheap, eggs and toast here runs you around $4.
This is the only place I've found in Ithaca with really excellent coffee and espresso drinks. It's a delicious place for lunch or brunch on the weekends, but they do fill up quickly so make a reservation if you're coming with a group. They will also make takeout espresso drinks for the road, which always make me happy.
Spent weekend in Ithaca visiting our son.  Our default breakfast spot is near Ithaca college, sunset grill. Which is a good solid breakfast joint. Nothing fancy. While driving around ithaca we happen to notice the carriage house. So we put our name in on Sunday at 11:35. We were told the wait was an hour,  which was fine  we came back about 12:15. We were sat at 12:30. It is great when a restaurant can accurately quote a wait! There were three of us we Ordered three items with the thought of sharing We had the brew French toast. The was outstanding.  As others have mentioned it could have used more bree. We Ordered the Vietnamese sandwich. Really good flavorful item. We also had a special. It was rabbit sausage with in egg in fresh faccacia bread.  Really tasty The place had a unique menu the food was well prepared and was very tasty At first it seemed a bit pretentious,  but after sitting down and dealing with a very pleasant and informed server this feeling went away. The French toast could have used more bree, otherwise all was really good! Nice atmosphere.  Unique menu. Great tast. Good staff.
Stopped here recently for lunch on a Friday.  Adorable inside, nicely decorated with rustic furnishings.  They had a nice crowd and the first thing I noticed was that the noise level was deafening......my husband and I were screaming just to hear each other.  The service started out promising enough, since our waitress was able to describe the 3 different green teas they offer, but it ended there.  We only saw her 2 more times- when she brought our apps and entrees all at once (oh how I love when every inch of the table is covered in plates of food getting cold) and when she dropped the check.  I think the mushroom soup might have been good, but it was only slightly warm when it was served.  (I could have told the server this is she had ever come to ask how everything was)  My salmon lt sandwich consisted of a few meager pieces of fish engulfed by half an inch of field greens that kept falling out of the bread and mingling with the pile of salad that also came on the plate.  Enough with the greens already!  You might want to bring your own drinks with you because no offer to get you another here.....although they WILL clear your empty beverage from the table ; )  .  I used to be a server, and to me, certain aspects of service are just common-sense.  But I'll give our waitress the benefit of the doubt......maybe she's never been on the other side of the apron and has never actually been a customer at a restaurant herself ; )
Four of us had a delicious weekday lunch consisting of various sandwiches on whole grain bread, served with fresh field greens and potato chips. One unique feature is that each sandwich was available in two sizes. Service was friendly and prompt and the atmosphere is charming.
Had brunch with friends at Carriage House at our 25th Reunion weekend.  I split the Strata and scoewich with my friend.  Both dishes were fabulous.  Just what we needed after a weekend of too much drinking and too little sleeping.  The ambiance was great.  A much more sophisticated place than what I would expect in Collegetown.  Excellent change of face from campus food.
Oh my god! AMAZING! We came here for brunch on the last day of our trip and everything was phenomenal! We had the brooches french toast...to die for.  The home fries were outstanding...and seriously the best bacon and sausage ever. They were very accommodating for our large group. The coffee was strong but good....a MUST stop if your in Ithaca.
perhaps my definition of "brunch" is different from theirs, but my definition includes an alcoholic beverage of some sort - namely a bloody mary or mimosa.  not that we were planning on drinking that day, but i was shocked that wasn't on the menu, especially in such a college town. in any case, my bf and i arrived at about 11am sunday morning and parking was pretty hard to come by.  if you haven't been here before, you can try your luck on the 3 parking spots in the "parking lot" but you will most likely end up walking a significant distance uphill/downhill between the restaurant and your car.  when we finally got to the restaurant, there was a 30-40 min wait for a table for two.  ok, understandable as this seems like the place to be.  there were chairs and a bench outside so you didn't have to stand if you didn't want to.  40 minutes on the dot later (and a couple getting questionably seated before we did), we were finally seated.  mark had the stuffed french toast, i had the salmon, and we ordered two eggs and sausage on the side, with 2 glasses of OJ.  wow, the food was good!  the french toast was a little sweet for me, but whatever - it was pretty tasty.  the salmon definitely hit the spot for me.  the toast that came with the salmon and the sides was crispy and the sausage was really lean and pretty damn good.  the OJ was freshly squeezed, and mark even ordered a 2nd glass. our server did the job.  she had a smile on her face, but i think you could tell that this was just a job for her.  either that, or the busy restaurant was keeping her from being more friendly.  whatever.  she was attentive and we never had to wait long for her or the food.   i'd recommend it for brunch, definitely, but try to get there early or suffer the consequences.
The Brie-stuffed French toast is out of this world. This is coming from someone that absolutely hates the overly sugar saturated generic french toasts! A must try. Needless to say our whole party clean finished their plates.
Everything on the lunch menu is a hit, especially the burger and the turkey sandwich.  Whether you go sweet or savory for breakfast you won't be sorry.  Expect long waits for wkend brunch, which is the best in town.
This place has really grown on me. The building was going through restoration the year I graduated, so ours has been a post-collegiate affair (slope days and other Ithaca treks). At first, I outright rejected the decor--seems a bit out of place, juxtaposed with Chappy and ABC. But it has grown on me, exacerbated by my girlfriend's special affinity for the magazines and glass tables. My feelings about it are this: They serve Gimme! coffee, and they take the time to make a pretty leaf thing in the foam. I like the pretty leaf thing. When I was 22, I would have screamed "yuppie scum!", shattered the mug on the wall above a perplexed barista's head, and headed-over for some Black Forest and 4-day-old popcorn across the street. Now, steeped in the mellowness of the mid-to-late 20s, latte art makes me tingly. They're open breakfast through dinner and beyond; that's a plus when you're dropping into I-town at weird, in-between meal times, as I'm known to do by the eight people who know me. I can speak nothing of their busy times or their more substantial offerings; I go for the coffee and the sweet stuff, and those alone. And I like their windows. Lead pane-y.
this is a very lovely place. the garnishment is eye catching. went there in the afternoon, brunch are not available at that point, but the scorn and coffee are pretty good. must try brunch sometime, best if can get round about the waiting.
Living in ithaca for almost three years, must say, this is one of the top 3 restaurants for me in ithaca. Love the ambience, the food is honest and delicious. The moment you walk into the restaurant and smell the freshly baked baguette, I'm sold already.... They used to have dinners as well before, but they stopped doing that unfortunately. I would recommend the burger. I believe its grass fed beef served over ciabatta. It's a bit small compared to regular burgers, but absolutely fantastic. Although the last two times  I've been ordering brie french toast which is also amazing! The fish cakes are also great, sausages, salads are also good. Hard to go wrong really as they have a small menu but they do everything in that menu well. Finally, you have to have the coffee. I'm told that the barista won consecutive awards in coffee contest. What he/she does with the cream to design the frothe in your coffee is genius! Every coffee looks like art. And tastes great by the way.
Went for breakfast and it was a mixed bag.  On the positive side, the coffee was good and discovered it was Piccolo Mondo from Gimme! coffee.  Bought a bag of beans at Gimme!. The OJ was also fresh.  Tim like the omelet with quinoa, shredded beets and lemon goat cheese, and French herbs.  The bun for the breakfast sandwich was excellent - very tasty!  The rest of it was not so good.  The eggs were entirely plain without any seasoning whatsoever.  Luckily, got some sausage too, which helped to liven it up.  Some will find the mis-matched antique furniture charming, but we found the chairs uncomfortable and the sewing machine table cramped and difficult to sit at.  It's too bad they don't provide service outside, as it would be nice to eat in their little garden area. It was also a bit pricey for breakfast - but that didn't seem to deter the undergrads that made up nearly all of the other patrons in the packed restaurant on a Thursday morning.
We went in for lunch while we were in town last week. Every thing on their brunch/lunch menu looked great. I finally settled for the Vietnamese sandwich and it was fantastic!! The BF had their Ruben sandwich which he thought was great as well. If only there was a Carriage House Cafe in DC...
Needless to say, good place for Sunday brunch. Amazing ambience although can be a little loud, had the classic breakfast choice, not mindblowing but still pretty nice. Good coffee!
I love this place. On both occasions I ordered an omelette. Both times it came with unusual but tasty, vegetarian ingredients. The first time my homemade grain toast was a little too "toasted" for my liking but that was a minor thing. The second time I substituted a small salad & it was delicious. Excellent Brooklyn-roasted, french press coffee. A lovely, efficient waitress, Alexis, on both occasions gave me great, suggestions for other dining options. She knows I will keep coming back to Carriage House, she wasn't steering me away! Lovely ambiance, too. And a stone's throw from my daughter's dorm.
REALLY enjoyed the salmon plate (him) and the strata (me). The tea was freshly brewed, both his iced tea and my hot tea. The service was good, the staff very friendly. Loved it!
So when I order my mainstay, must-have items from Carriage House, I will give it 5 stars every single time. However, there are some items on the menu that aren't to my taste. Usually it's all a matter of preference. For me, that means savory over sweet. If you've got a huge sweet tooth and love Brie, of course you should go for the Brie-stuffed French toast. Have their raspberry scone with your mochaccino. Try the specials- they almost always have some unique twist on a strata, fresh sorbet mimosas, and entrees that incorporate seasonal ingredients. And I love their Vietnamese Banh Mi, raspberry scones, mocha, strata, garlic-battered home fries with their tomato-ginger ketchup, salads, Reuben, burger, and specials. They're all drool-worthy. What I don't love... the Brie-stuffed French toast, though that's understandable. I love Brie, but I'm not a big fan of super-saccharine things. I was hesitant to try it. Even my waitress thought I wouldn't really like it, and suggested I get something more savory. But I wanted to step outside my comfort zone, and didn't listen, so now I'm left with a craving for their Banh Mi...The grilled cheese and pesto is good, but not great. For $10, it's really not worth it. Their salmon plate and other breakfast items are good, but nothing to write home about. The worst, though, is the Braised Short Rib, the new item on the menu. The short rib  was quite bland. There were gross pieces of tendon and cartilage in it. The rapini and white bean hummus were weird additions, to say the least. The rapini was bitter and fibrous, as rapini always is. The white bean hummus was bland and creamy. The cheese and bread were good. All of those ingredients mixed together were too much: the flavors and textures clashed so that I was tasting each individual (not-so-nice) component rather than a delicious mix of everything. Anyway, even with that one train wreck of a menu item, and their very high prices, I still love Carriage House and will always return to it whenever I'm in the area. The items I listed up there in my second paragraph are really just THAT good. Oh, and bonus points for the ambience, especially in the late Spring to Summer when all the flowers are in bloom.
I would eat at the Carriage House five times a week if someone would take me there!  Best brunch anywhere, best fresh scones and baked goods that you can watch disappear from the bakery case while you read the Times and sip your Americano on a weekend morning.  Really nice staff, great chef Kristian.  And all in a beautifully renovated carriage house with gorgeous gardens.  Highly recommended!
We had lunch here the other day before we dropped off our daughter at a sports camp. We had high hopes for some great sandwiches and/or breakfast items based on the descriptions and reviews we had read.  We are also suckers for homemade bread!  The interior of the cafe is really cute, since it really is an old carriage house.  It is decorated nicely and has original stone walls.   Each of us ordered a sandwich - grilled cheese pesto, salmon LT, and the chicken bahn mi.  First of all let me say the bread they are on is probably very good, but unfortunately it is overpowered by SALT and way too much sauce.   The flavor of the bread cannot come through because of all of the sauce or whatever condiment is on the sandwich.  My smoked salmon was so salty that I must have drunk a gallon of water the rest of the day.  I expected lox which is salty, but really, it was WAY too salty.  My daughter's grilled cheese was also overly salty.  This place is overpriced for what they serve and the quality of the food.  We expected much better and were disappointed.  Skip this place and find somewhere else to eat.
I completely agree with Lanie... I had heard so many great things about their brunch, but was completely underwhelmed. Sure, it has a lovely interior which my 85-year-old grandmother would absolutely ADORE, but the wait, the service, the prices... too much for what turned out to be too little. Limited menu, small portions, mediocre meal. Might as well hop across the road to ABC cafe, where they have similar fare (but a lot more selection, especially for vegetarians), with better service, bigger portions, reasonable prices and room to breathe! Plus, half the wait and a much more pleasant experience overall.
I will have to go against the grain here and say that this place is hyped up more than is warranted (don't hate on me for this!).  The thing is, the food was prepared well and tasty, but not exclusively so.  The menu selections were nice and the portion size was more than ample.  Price was well within the range for the servings.  The problem for me was in the environment.  The first chair I sat it was so rickety that I thought it might break so I changed it out.  Second one was the same: I could rock back and forth in it.  To call the atmosphere rustic would be doing "rustic" a disservice. It almost has the feel of sitting on a picnic bench at the park.  Still...the food is good enough that I may go back.  I wonder if they have take out...
Carriage House is charming and delivers a solid brunch. It is conveniently located near Cornell, and is often bustling with students and Ithacans alike. I used to frequent there with friends during my undergraduate, and we were always pleased but neer wowed. The farmer's breakfast was good and the toast was always delicious.
I do not consider Carriage House Cafe a go-to place for brunch.  They have a paltry number of vegetarian options.  Most of those are cheese or cream-based.  They did not seem to cater to vegans at all. The very limited menu was dominated by meats and creamy dishes.   I have also eaten lunch there and was not happy with the quality or quantity of food for the price.  Very flavorless and mediocre. The atmosphere is pretty nice but it's hectic and noisy for brunch.   I think Cafe DeWitt does a better job and has a wider range of food for comparable prices (but the portions are larger) and the food is very consistently perfectly cooked.  So, I'd opt for Cafe DeWit instead for a flawless brunch with high-quality ingredients (although Cafe DeWit is an odd location in the middle of DeWit mall).
All time favourite.
I don't understand all the positive reviews for this place. The one star is for the lovely antique carriage house building itself. The food is appalling. It's way overpriced, it came to our table cold, and some items were inedible. The $4 sausage has a bizarre and off-putting flavor that made it impossible to eat. The eggs have a weird texture that made me wonder if they were from a carton of pasteurized egg liquid. The bacon is petrified and so hard it might break your fillings. The french toast comes to the table burned.
Excellent food and great atmosphere!
I needed to find a cafe that my family & I could grab brunch at in addition to being close to the waterfalls. This place had great reviews & the location & atmosphere seemed to fit our moods, so we tried it out. I am so glad that we did.. The food was excellent, the service was quick. I highly recommend this place for anyone visiting from out of town, or those that like that old cottage feel (this place has that). I can't wait to come back!
Blown away by the Sconewich! So many delicious tastes in my mouth! Really cute yummy place. Definitely coming back! The French toast was also great, cooked to perfection. Not too expensive. Also I suggest trying the ketchup it's homemade!! Really tasty!
The food is all right, but expensive for the portions you get. At one point, we paid $5 for a small side of potatoes for brunch. Also, the service is only ok. We had a friend's birthday brunch here, and an extra person showed up. They acted like it was the end of the world and literally said they weren't sure they could seat the whole party because of this issue. They got it figured, but seriously...
Best brunch in town!
I really miss this place. While in Ithaca, it was one of my favorite spots: the space is gorgeous, and the food was good too. The also had the best Latte in town. There arent alot of things that I miss about Ithaca, but Carriage House is one of them (and Wegmans being another)
Great Saturday morning brunch at the quaint little cafe just off Cornell's campus.
Carriage House Cafe provides a great brunch!  Before going I consulted the YELP to see what people like here and I wasn't disappointed.  The Brie Stuffed French Toast was great! Really great (which says something because I was expecting not to like it).  I would say its only flaw is the fact that its over ten dollars for two pieces of bread, some brie in the middle and the berry puree.  Its really good and I'm glad I tried it but I certainly couldn't afford to get it if I frequented Carriage House.  The special (two eggs, two pieces of bacon and two pieces of toast) was pretty standard, but all high quality (especially the nice thick pieces of bacon that were still crispy).  As people said, the garlic home fries were awesome! Now they are the home fries that I compare all home fries to (and none seem to hold up).  The one dish that was a bit underwhelming was the sconewich.  I'm not sure what it was but something about the flavor didn't do it for me.  It wasn't bad, just not really what I am into and with so many great things to choose from there, I won't be ordering that again. Carriage House Cafe serves a great (but pricey) brunch.  I left full and content and would really like to go back.
The smoked salmon is a bit too salty for my taste, but the brie-stuffed French toast is an absolute must-try. The wait takes a long time though and they don't take reservations so be sure to arrive early in the morning if you want to be seated quickly.
My favorite casual place in Ithaca. I used to live just around the corner from here. Great food, great prices, portions on the small side though. Which means you and your date can split three plates rather than two for weekend brunch. All the better. Very friendly owner and staff. Coffee not that impressive but OK. Five stars for being among the best places in town.
another awesome brunch place. the sad part is that i discovered this place when I was about to leave Ithaca. Nevertheless, it's got one of the best brunch. And the coffee is just so good. I hope I do go back to Ithaca sometime, just do that I can have another good brunch here!
The Certified Humane "Smart Chicken" feels good and tastes great, too.
Worth every penny!
I was out in Ithaca for a job interview and only had a few hours to look around.  On my way to one of the waterfalls in the town I passed the Carriage House Cafe and stopped to take a picture because it was so cute outside. Unfortunately the waterfall access was closed, but the Carriage House was open.  The owner was there and chatted with me over some great coffee.  Unfortunately I will not be moving to Ithaca, but I am glad I stumbled upon this great little coffee shop.
We always come here on Sunday mornings for brunch, and make sure to arrive before they open at 9am.  It fills up quickly, so if you aren't in the first wave of seatings, it might be a bit of a wait.  That being said, they are always very quick to bring out food and drinks!  The brioche french toast is to die for, and their pancakes (when offered) are perfectly made.  The omelets can sometimes be a little iffy, so be careful when choosing those.  They have weird combinations of flavors that can be a bit off-putting.  Overall, a great place for a pretty affordable Sunday morning brunch!
Breakfast menu is unique, but they offer a few breakfast staples for the picky eaters...plating was simple, felt a bit empty/bare compared to typical breakfast eateries, but was great on taste!  Coffee was strong and bold, but refills weren't free which I normally expect...coffee was better than normal though making it worth it...Beautiful building, lots of charm.  Definitely worth checking out!
Amazing brunch food! Definitely will be coming back next time I am in town....thank you Danielle for introducing me to this place :)
Amazing brie-stuffed French toast!!
The Carriage house is great. We had our wedding rehearsal dinner here and Dominique made sure it went off without a hitch. The food and service are top-notch. Dominique gave us an incredible amount of flexibility with the menu and let us design the courses how we liked, which is extremely rare. No preset standardized chicken, beef, pork meals here, nope, you decide what you want to eat and they do the rest to make it an amazing experience. I'd strongly recommend to anyone with a small-to-medium sized party of 40-50-ish people who are looking for a high quality, memorable experience. Make sure to check out the upstairs loft while you're at it! P.S. All the posts *swooning* over the brie-stuffed french toast are true... I'm addicted... too bad I live 3,000 miles away.
Excellent food and service.   We went there twice for brunch and it was excellent.   They had about an hour wait for brunch though, but excellent, comfortable waiting areas.   My only recommendation to them would be to expand into their unused space as soon as possible!
Perhaps the best service I've ever had in a restaurant, even on the Saturday morning of Cornell visit weekend. Exceptionally good coffee, absolutely beautiful setting, and expertly prepared food. Absolutely worth the price; and if you want to go cheap, eggs and toast here runs you around $4.
This is the only place I've found in Ithaca with really excellent coffee and espresso drinks. It's a delicious place for lunch or brunch on the weekends, but they do fill up quickly so make a reservation if you're coming with a group. They will also make takeout espresso drinks for the road, which always make me happy.
Spent weekend in Ithaca visiting our son.  Our default breakfast spot is near Ithaca college, sunset grill. Which is a good solid breakfast joint. Nothing fancy. While driving around ithaca we happen to notice the carriage house. So we put our name in on Sunday at 11:35. We were told the wait was an hour,  which was fine  we came back about 12:15. We were sat at 12:30. It is great when a restaurant can accurately quote a wait! There were three of us we Ordered three items with the thought of sharing We had the brew French toast. The was outstanding.  As others have mentioned it could have used more bree. We Ordered the Vietnamese sandwich. Really good flavorful item. We also had a special. It was rabbit sausage with in egg in fresh faccacia bread.  Really tasty The place had a unique menu the food was well prepared and was very tasty At first it seemed a bit pretentious,  but after sitting down and dealing with a very pleasant and informed server this feeling went away. The French toast could have used more bree, otherwise all was really good! Nice atmosphere.  Unique menu. Great tast. Good staff.
Stopped here recently for lunch on a Friday.  Adorable inside, nicely decorated with rustic furnishings.  They had a nice crowd and the first thing I noticed was that the noise level was deafening......my husband and I were screaming just to hear each other.  The service started out promising enough, since our waitress was able to describe the 3 different green teas they offer, but it ended there.  We only saw her 2 more times- when she brought our apps and entrees all at once (oh how I love when every inch of the table is covered in plates of food getting cold) and when she dropped the check.  I think the mushroom soup might have been good, but it was only slightly warm when it was served.  (I could have told the server this is she had ever come to ask how everything was)  My salmon lt sandwich consisted of a few meager pieces of fish engulfed by half an inch of field greens that kept falling out of the bread and mingling with the pile of salad that also came on the plate.  Enough with the greens already!  You might want to bring your own drinks with you because no offer to get you another here.....although they WILL clear your empty beverage from the table ; )  .  I used to be a server, and to me, certain aspects of service are just common-sense.  But I'll give our waitress the benefit of the doubt......maybe she's never been on the other side of the apron and has never actually been a customer at a restaurant herself ; )
Four of us had a delicious weekday lunch consisting of various sandwiches on whole grain bread, served with fresh field greens and potato chips. One unique feature is that each sandwich was available in two sizes. Service was friendly and prompt and the atmosphere is charming.
Had brunch with friends at Carriage House at our 25th Reunion weekend.  I split the Strata and scoewich with my friend.  Both dishes were fabulous.  Just what we needed after a weekend of too much drinking and too little sleeping.  The ambiance was great.  A much more sophisticated place than what I would expect in Collegetown.  Excellent change of face from campus food.
perhaps my definition of "brunch" is different from theirs, but my definition includes an alcoholic beverage of some sort - namely a bloody mary or mimosa.  not that we were planning on drinking that day, but i was shocked that wasn't on the menu, especially in such a college town. in any case, my bf and i arrived at about 11am sunday morning and parking was pretty hard to come by.  if you haven't been here before, you can try your luck on the 3 parking spots in the "parking lot" but you will most likely end up walking a significant distance uphill/downhill between the restaurant and your car.  when we finally got to the restaurant, there was a 30-40 min wait for a table for two.  ok, understandable as this seems like the place to be.  there were chairs and a bench outside so you didn't have to stand if you didn't want to.  40 minutes on the dot later (and a couple getting questionably seated before we did), we were finally seated.  mark had the stuffed french toast, i had the salmon, and we ordered two eggs and sausage on the side, with 2 glasses of OJ.  wow, the food was good!  the french toast was a little sweet for me, but whatever - it was pretty tasty.  the salmon definitely hit the spot for me.  the toast that came with the salmon and the sides was crispy and the sausage was really lean and pretty damn good.  the OJ was freshly squeezed, and mark even ordered a 2nd glass. our server did the job.  she had a smile on her face, but i think you could tell that this was just a job for her.  either that, or the busy restaurant was keeping her from being more friendly.  whatever.  she was attentive and we never had to wait long for her or the food.   i'd recommend it for brunch, definitely, but try to get there early or suffer the consequences.

Alright, you're in ithaca and there isnt all that much around for good food. So in comparison to the other restaurants here for Carriage House's food (specialized for brunch) is amazing and hence the 5 star rating. Atmosphere is as good as it gets around this area and the cost is a bit on the pricier end but then again so is everything nearby. The Ruben is amazing, and a half size is decent if you don't want a too large of a meal. Usually when i get Rubens in Ithaca the bread comes really hard or the corned beef tastes really bad but not here, it is excellent. Best place to have brunch in collegetown/downtown area, hands down.
A must, if you can get a reservation here - their brunch is to die for.  The brie-stuffed french toast must be ordered, and their house salmon plate adds a nice balance to the sweetness of the former dish. I came with a rather large group (8-10 folks), but we were seated within 10 minutes on a Saturday afternoon (albeit at two separate tables, which was perfectly fine with us).  The service was great, and the atmosphere was totally unique (it feels like you're sitting in someone's mini barn). Just goes to show that there are places other than Collegetown Bagels for a hearty (and unique!) brunch experience.
Everything about the Carriage House Cafe--the food, decor, staff--was absolutely amazing. My group of three was given a wait time of 45 minutes for a Sunday brunch. We were able to sit in an upstairs lounge, which provides lemon water and seats, and were even able to place orders for coffee or lattes. This was a nice touch and made the wait time seem shorter than it actually was. I ordered the egg sandwich without meat, and was told that I could substitute pesto instead. I am glad that I listened because it was absolutely delicious! I also tasted the brie-stuffed french toast (amazing!!) and vegetable strata. Can't wait to come back and try something new!
Wow. Overrated! Have you been here when you haven't waited 45 minutes for a table and that's only the beginning of your wait? The french toast (oh stuffed with brie, how crazy!) is NOT THAT GOOD. Sheesh. For their prices to not include any accompaniments is crazy. I mean good for them for continuing to charge exhorbitant prices and providing really bad service and food at the same time. Plus is a really inviting, cute atmosphere. They could vastly improve by making their food quicker, better, etc., though.
Do not believe the brunch hype. In our experience the food was very uneven. The breakfast sandwich carried its weight and the breakfast potatoes were quite tasty though had clearly been sitting out for quite a while before they were served to us. However the "French style" omelet of the day, which sounded delicious, was just two overcooked rubbery eggs with a mess of flavorless hash sitting on top. My companion barely made it through a couple of bites. Not impressed. The atmosphere was pleasant and the service was fine, however I was a little put off by the quoted prices for coffee refills on the menu (really?).
The food was good but over priced. I ordered a side of two egg whites with my french toast and they charged me $7 for two egg whites in addition to the $9.25 I paid for the french toast. With tax and tip my bill came out to $25 for breakfast. While the food was good it wasn't good enough to justify the price.
The atmosphere at Carriage House Cafe is an amazing combination of superlative hospitality, unique antiques (including cafe tables made from old Singer Sewing machines), and wonderful food. My husband had the Brie stuffed brioche French toast with a berry coulis. The Brie added a savory component to the sweet bread and berries, very nice indeed. I had the house burger made of grass fed beef served on a ciabatta roll (all bakery items made in house) with sun-dried tomato purée. Call me crazy, I think I could taste the difference in the beef.... My burger was cooked to perfection, medium rare. Will definitely return to Carriage House again, perhaps on the weekend where I can get the pancakes...
The food is really really good. My biggest problem is the wait and the service. The Carriage House does not accommodate that many customers; it would definitely behoove  them to use the upstairs area as another dining location. As a result of limited space and limited hours (I understand it's a brunch place. But if they decided to ever open for dinner, I would be extremely grateful) you are usually waiting for an hour+ to get a table. You basically have to devote the entire middle of your day to dining here. They do not take reservations on weekends, which is when the restaurant is busiest. I recall one time when I was out to eat with my boyfriend and his family. Since it was a weekend, we couldn't make a reservation, so we were waiting a good hour. Suddenly, a local politician and her family showed up. They were immediately seated. After some yelling on our part, a table miraculously opened up for our party as well. Pretty dirty and rude of the establishment, though. As people have previously mentioned, the service is a little haphazard, with waiters seeming too busy to really care about the service you receive. It's also fairly crowded inside and extremely noisy. However, the majority of this can be overlooked. The reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is simply because of the food. The food is absolutely delicious. The chicken banh mi is heaven. So basically if you are looking for quick seating and attentive service, then take your business elsewhere. But if you're looking for quality food and have an hour or two set aside in your day, this place is worth coming to.
We ordered the Carriage House Burger, Brie Stuffed French Toast, and Pig's Ear terrine. The brie stuffed french toast is the most common rave item. It was good. The toast was fluffy but wasn't dense and rich enough to convince me it was brioche. The brie inside was generous, the syrup was very flat and could have been just reduced simple syrup. The berry sauce was kinda bland and sour. The Carriage house Burger was too small for its bun and the onions that came with it were wayyyy too salty, tasted like they were boiled in soy sauce. The pig's ear terrine was really impressive made but the portion was very small. Serving it with some daikon was a nice touch. This place gets raved about a lot - The food was okay.
This is probably the best place for brunch in Ithaca though all the brunch places in Ithaca aren't very good. I think everyone gets excited about carriage house because it seems so good in comparison to other places. Though I think their food is good for Ithaca it is nothing compared to those brunch places in LA and NYC. Their signatures include a Brie stuffed French toast with a berry dressing. They also have this Strata dish which is similar to a frittata. Chicken Banh Mi is also a signature. It is an American spin on a Vietnamese sandwich though it is still pretty tasty. They also have a couple of smoked salmon dishes, which are really good but I probably feel that way because I love anything smoked salmon. For those of you who are brie and salmon fans they have a smoked salmon plate which contains brie and pieces of toast. The mixed greens salad they serve with everything is really good. Usually I just get the chicken banh mi sandwich. I've had the French toast and I think it is overrated. Sometimes it's good but sometimes they don't melt the brie inside the French toast enough so it becomes two blocks of brioche bread with a hard piece of cheese at the center which isn't very appetizing. For dessert I've had the pots de crème before its good but nothing special. The first time you go there you can get a free drink if you check in on foursquare or face book which is nice so don't forget to do that! I got a free expresso by doing this. I'd have to say their expresso is pretty good. Overall if you want to have breakfast in a nice quaint area with vintage decorations you should come here because there probably aren't very many other good breakfast options. Warning the service can be kind of slow! Though the wait staff is friendly. Once they were too slow with my expresso so they gave it to me on the house, which was nice.
Probably the best breakfast sandwich I've eaten (sausage, egg, and cheese on some sort of toast).  Girlfriend got the best bacon of her life.  The quality of the food here is off the charts!  It's a bit pricey. Just don't make the mistake we made, showing up at 11:30 on Sunday.  We waited an hour and a half up stairs where we were told to wait, and still no one came to get us.  It was insanely busy, but we had already driven an hour so we waited it out. Fantastic food, just avoid peak hours.
Recommended. Good food. Good service. Nice decor The French toast was excellent. ....very light. Rabbit burger was tasty. Would come back if lived nearby. Coffee apparently good. Quick service. Bacon so so.
Good food. The event space upstairs is also very cool. Make sure to check it out after you eat.
Food was delicious! I usually hate brunch because the food is generic and overpriced and tastes like something I could've made at home or worse. However, this place had a very cute ambiance and the tables were all mismatched and unique. The waitress was also very nice and service was great. I went on a Saturday morning at 9:30am and it was mostly empty so I didn't have to wait at all. What we ordered: - Salmon LT: 9 Grain bread was delicious! I could just eat the bread by itself. It had a great crunchy texture. The salmon was house cured and you could definitely taste the difference compared to packaged salmon. What I really liked too was the sundried tomato puree. I thought that added a different spin than just a slice of tomato. I want to order this again! - Toast with maple syrup and berry coulis - delicious and not overly sweet. - 2 eggs, bacon and toast - your typical but if that what you want, by all means, it was delicious
We always enjoy the food and staff at Carriage House Cafe. Their burgers are amazing and I have heard they have great scones :) They always use the most fresh ingredients and do a great job taking care of their customers. If you are in Ithaca and hungry for lunch or breakfast Carriage House Cafe is a great option!
Awesome-- Ricotta cheese french toast and smoked salmon dish were both great. Coffee is tasty as well. Highly recommend!
Mad good. Great menu and delicious food. Service is usually kind of slow. Also can't accommodate large parties very well. The best place for brunch in Ithaca.
I had the rabbit patè, it was very good and I enjoyed that. However, we had been scouting this place for weeks prior to our visit and I had my heart set on the Banh Mi.  They were out of chicken. Bummer. I do like the decor and the food was great.  The coffee is awful.
Get the brie stuffed French toast the first time you come here; it's amazing. Some of the people in our group got an omelette, and another person got the strata. While they thought those were good, they wished they ordered the brie stuffed French toast instead. This would be a great place to take anyone from out of town who visits you, like your parents. It's a great atmosphere for brunch and the staff is very nice and helpful. It may be a bit pricey for lunch (each of us paid around $18 per person for a dish and drink) but a nice place to eat if you want something on the fancier side.
So it was a busy Sunday morning and my first time at the Carriage House.  The hostess greeted me and my girlfriend with a smile and indicated to us that it would be a 30 min wait; no problem!  I meandered over to the coffee bar area and took a quick read of the Carriage House self published photo book which was filled with great photos and brief history of the house.  After some time I noticed tables opening up and really no one being seated in them and it turns out the hostess forgot about our table which of course is kinda annoying.  We were seated and it took at least 10 minutes for our server to come over and greet us in a very faint voice which I could barely understand.  I felt as if I was in another dimension at times with the flakiness of the staff! With our hunger growing we quickly ordered some coffee which was strong but a bit bitter and our brunch as I didn't want to waste anymore time.  The scenery was nice and the decor accommodating to the motif of this historic house.  There was a stone wall and a bunch of I guess farming decor throughout the place.  Anyway, our food came out quite promptly.  I ordered the Sconewhich, which is scrambled egg w/ NYS cheddar cheese inside a griddled ham and cheese scone.  I must say this was like something I had never had!  Super delicious and full of flavor, the scone really put the finishing touches on the whole meal and cannot image it without it! A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! All in all in was a nice experience the natural light coming in on this sunny late morning through the beautiful windows and the wonderful food made up a bit for the dumb and checked out waitstaff!  Who knows maybe they all fell down and hit their heads on the concrete before coming to work?!?! Go for the food and decor and be sure to make crazy concentrated eye contact with the staff to get you seated and your first cup of coffee! Cheers!
Whoever thought a quaint cozy cafe could pump out such a mean grass-fed burger? Local cows I am guessing... Excellent food here and ambiance. Had a taste of a few things and the vegetable soup, the pesto grilled cheese, and the potatoes were all delicious. Good beers and they even have sorbet mimosas. Gonna come here every time I visit with my girlfriend's family.
The place is cute. The services are great. I would recommend this place.
Best brunch in Ithaca. The wait during weekends can be quite long so you better go early. My favorite is the Brie-stuffed French toast. Sooooo good! Sometimes they run out so make sure you come early! The brioche is home made by the bakery every day and the jam is made from local fruits, very fresh! However, I have noticed some inconsistency in terms of quality from time to time. There was one time my portion was half of the regular size and one time there was almost no Brie in my French toast. The waiters here are quite nice, she offered to put on more Brie that one time when I almost had none in my French toast. I have also tried other foods here and they are all pretty good, carriage house burger, sconewich, specials. Their scones are also really good with very unique flavors. You should definitely get some to go after your meal.
One of the best brunch options in Ithaca, evident by the ridiculous wait on weekends; however, as a brunch fanatic, I think Carriage House is slightly overrated, though it's still very good. Carriage House service is adequately courteous and prompt to get you in and out (so people waiting can get seated at your table before your chair turns cold). The coffee is rich, smooth, and flavorful (they make a killer cappuccino), and the fresh squeezed juice are wonderful. For your first time, you must try the Brie-stuffed french toast. For additional visits, be sure to ask your server for the breakfast specials of the day -- they're usually creative and tasty. While waiting for your meal or after you pay the check, make sure to take note of the lovely decor, and take a peek at the beautiful loft upstairs before you head out! Note: They're closed on Mondays!
Great brunch location...beautiful building....tough location to find parking....and be prepared to wait on the weekends....now none of that matters..because this restaurant is worth all of that and more.  Best baristas in Ithaca, all of the drinks are great.  All of the breakfast items are delicious. I had steak and eggs this visit, over easy eggs were perfect and the steak melted in my mouth....love coming here
Fantastic brunch. The menu is more than the usual run of the mill. We ordered the pigs ear terrine and rabbit sausage for appetizers. Both were fantastic. For main I had the Brie stuffed French toast; such a wonderful combination.  Hubby got Eggs and steak and they were cooked to perfection. Overall a great place to visit if you are in Ithaca. It does get busy and we had to wait 40 minutes to be seated but it was definitely worth it.
My fiancé and I were in town for the weekend and stopped in for brunch. I had the Brie stuffed French Toast Special and oh. my. god. it was DELICIOUS.   The brie between the french toast was not overpowering and didn't make the dish taste too brie-y. On top of the french toast were berries and chopped pieces of ham (?) which I felt was an excellent touch as it added that hint of saltiness to this otherwise sweet dish. Also, I don't usually eat syrup with my pancakes or french toast but the plate was in somewhat of a pool of syrup. I actually thought the syrup complimented the dish very well as the bread was thick enough not to be saturated in it. There was also an option to have this dish with a poached egg on top for an additional cost. The decor of the cafe was also very cool and the wait staff was very attentive. Prior to being seated we had a 20 minute wait where we just grabbed an americano and mochachino and sat in an additional seating space (probably for private parties?) with a few tables as well as a fireplace on the second floor. If I am ever in the Fingerlakes area again, I will definitely be retuning for brunch!
Hands down the best brunch in Ithaca. Their french toasts are amazing (especially the brie-stuffed brioche...). Pretty much anything you get off the menu will be amazing, so just go. Slightly more costly than I'd like, but it's worth it.
Fantabulous place for Sunday morning hangover (or not) brunch. Super cute place that reminds of you one of those adorable little cabin restaurants that you go to after an afternoon of skiing (or something like that). The price is reasonable for what they give you and the food is delicious. I definitely still have to try their brie-stuffed french toast. The only downside is that the wait can be pretty long if you go during peak hours (i.e. Sunday brunch hours). My group had to wait about 45 min-1 hr the last time we went. Also, parking can be somewhat inconvenient. They have a tiny gravel lot in front that can fit 3 cars; unless you're lucky, you have to find street parking nearby. But it's so worth it.
I have been here a few times and have never been disappointed by the food. But the prices are pretty ridiculous for what you get. And what brunch place charges nearly a dollar to refill your coffee? Well, this one I guess. Anyways, here's a tip. The breakfast sandwiches are spot on, but be warned that they are only half a sandwich (which I find a little cheeky considering they charge close to $10 if you substitute bacon or sausage for the ham). Instead you can order, I think it's called the special, which gets you the same eggs, bacon, and toast for $3 less, and then you can make your own half sandwich. Edit: I forgot to mention. Their 'tomato puree' is pretentious nonsense. If you want to make your own house ketchup, then that's fine. But don't give me tomato paste with my french fries and act like it's a winning combination. There is a reason no one buys cans of tomato paste to dip things in.
The wait to get a seat for brunch on the weekend is pretty bad, but it is so worth it. I've been here at least 3-4 times and I think it's to die for. The restaurant's decor is adorable and quaint and cozy. It feels like you're in a little lodge. Their coffee is fabulous and it comes with fresh tasting cream. Alternatively, they have good espresso drinks (cappuccino is my fav) that come with little designs in the foam. :) I always have to get the Brie stuffed French toast, which is as good as it sounds and the portion is almost unmanageably big unless you're starving. Comes with maple syrup and berry coulis. The omelet of the day is my usual other go-to, I'll get that and the French toast and split with my dining partner. The omelet is always smaller and is accompanied by two little biscotti-sized pieces of fresh buttered toast. Sometimes they have specials if you check in on Foursquare. Give it a shot, I got a free cappuccino the first time I checked in. You will not be disappointed with this place.
Actually really bad - I think the high reviews might be VERY inflated because there isn't really a good brunch place anywhere in the neighborhood, and this one at least looks nice. Upon walking in, I overheard other customers complaining "If Gordon Ramsay were here, these guys would be in trouble..", and "I could get this for McDonald's for $2.00!" -  I actually heard only negative comments from the patrons. They were spot on. Pros:  The ambiance - the place itself is beautiful! Cons: Everything else, unfortunately.  The place seems to have a fairly creative menu and uses high quality, often local ingredients, but they're so unskillfully prepared that the final dishes are actually barely acceptable.  The "chef" uses almost no seasoning on anything ... (PRO TIP FOR CHEFS: When you see that the salt shakers on all of your tables are almost empty, that means you need to prepare some of your food with at least a little bit of seasoning) The dishes are also very utilitarian - no effort into presentation of the food.  Then again, there seems to be no effort put into the preparation of the food, so at least they're consistent. The service is actually really bad too. Our service was rushed, impersonal, she never refilled water glasses, never asked us how the food was, and we were rushed out of there like cattle the second we put our forks down.  Seriously rude. Would not be back! ________ Mate Factor may be run by racist homophobic cult, but at least they're not rude to their customers and they have some damned fine brunch!  You guys could learn a thing or two from Twelve Tribes (like, how to cook and serve customers - none of the other stuff, please!)
I've only been there once, so this review is based on only one lunch.  I had my doubts when we entered, because it seemed a bit like the place was in chaos.  I think they were training new people and the place was very busy, which seemed to be stretching the capacity of the waitstaff and kitchen.  It looked like some people had been waiting quite a while for their lunches. Fortunately for me, we seemed to have gotten there at just the right time and our lunches came quickly.  Based only on my lunch, a burger, I would give 5 stars.  It was made with grass-fed beef and it was delicious.  It also had cheddar and sundried tomatoes and I think it was on focaccia bread.  It really was one of the tastiest burgers I've ever had.  I would say it was a little undercooked (I asked for medium and there was some significant redness left).  My girlfriend had some sandwich that was okay, but absolutely soaked in oil.  She did say that the burger was likely THE tastiest burger she had ever had.
I was very disappointed with my dining experience here. I came for breakfast, and was treated rudely by my waitress. I think her name is Carla. She seemed rushed even though there were very few people in the restaurant. When she served the food, she put it down without a word and rushed away before asking if I needed anything else. I had to flag her down to ask if they had any steak sauce for the steak and eggs, to which she replied "no" and walked away. How about another option? I was disappointed to see another table being offered hot sauce towards the end of my meal because that would have been a fine alternative. I also would have enjoyed another cup of coffee (even though you have to pay for it) with my meal, but she didn't bother to check. When I asked her for another cup to go, she frowned, told me I had to pay for it, and was surprised when I said that was okay. Maybe she treated me poorly because I'm a person of color... I can only hope that wasn't the case. What she didn't know is that I was dining on a corporate account and would have been happy to try more things on the menu and tip well, but she certainly didn't earn it. The food was good, but not spectacular. I come to Ithaca on business every year, and I won't bother to eat here again unless I hear the service has gotten better.
Best breakfast out I've ever had. Everything was prepared to perfection.  I've NEVER had that happen before.   French toast with fruit compote and real maple syrup. Homemade local sausage with hint of chorizo flavoring. Garlic crusted homefries with homemade ginger ketchup. Fresh OJ. Finally, my tea: I drink green tea, which 99% of the time is wrong if you don't make it yourself.  I might say that their's was a touch strong, but quite delicious which made this a 5 star affair.
Tasty! My mother and I were passing through Ithaca and stumbled upon this. NOTE: We didn't sit down, just ordered to go. The decor inside does seem cute though and the staff seemed friendly when we ordered. Prices were reasonable for the quality. My mother got the strata and I got a breakfast sandwich with scrambled eggs and NY Cheddar cheese on an olive and feta scone and a coffee. The coffee was decent, not sour or burnt but fresh. The scrambled eggs were a little overcooked, but then again, I like them a little undercooked. The scone was DELICIOUS though. If I lived in the neighborhood, I would definitely drop by this place with friends on weekends. Seems like a decent brunch joint.
Kinda pricey for the portions. They have solid offerings for small town Ithaca but they probably won't stand a chance in a big city.
This is probably my longest review yet.  Based upon the exterior, I came in thinking we'd LOVE this place... We stopped in her for lunch 4/16/13 while our dog was at an appointment at Cornell Animal Hospital, which is very nearby. Long story short:  Beautiful building.  Cool, rustic decor.  Loud dining room.  Good food.  Abysmal service. As far as the building and decor are concerned, I told my wife that this is much like I'd envision her decorating a place.  The rustic feel and warmth are just her style, and remind me of our home.  Warm, rustic and cool decorations around.     We tried:  Chevre (goat cheese) salad, Grass-fed burger on ciabatta (myself) + soup and smoked salmon sandwich (my wife).  I thought the salad and the burger were good.  I'd get either one of those again. The only issues we had was with the service and noise level. As for the noise, we have a beautiful local restaurant that had the same issue.  They put those sound studio cushions on the ceiling, painted them to match and the problem was resolved.  They blended into the decor and eliminated the problem.  As it is at Carriage House Cafe now, it was hard to have a conversation during a lively lunch hour.  Not a huge deal, because it's sometimes nice to be in the middle of the action.   First service clue:  I noticed after our server took our order was that she didn't ask if we wanted the optional kettle chips.  The sandwiches don't come with chips or fries, but they're listed on the menu as being available upon request.  No big deal...we should've thought of it, and I didn't until she'd left the table.  My bad, but suggestive up-selling is in the server's best interest, too.     Our order came out quickly, but all at once.  Soup + sandwich + salad + burger.  Sorry, but this is one of my pet peeves, and restaurant service 101.  I don't enjoy 4 plates on the table at once OR having to hurry through the salad because the burger (or whatever entree)  is getting cold. Once our food was dropped off, our server turned and left quickly.  "Can I get you anything else?" seems to be fairly standard at this point in a restaurant meal, but not here.  My drink was empty, and she was gone before I knew it, so I went without during the rest of our lunch.  I suppose we're trained to be asked about refills by servers.  Tips are based upon check average, right?? We did not see our server again until she dropped the check (literally) and went right back to her other business.  She doesn't know that we enjoyed the food and that the service sucked.  Why??  Because she just left the check and walked off.  No "How was everything?"  No "Can I get you anything else?"  She just left the check. "Thank you.  Have a nice day.  Everything was great!", I sarcastically  exclaimed as she turned and left our table.  She turned and looked at me in such a way that leads me to believe that she's got no clue that she's in the wrong profession.  She walked away and the girls at the next table chuckled.  I am sorry that anyone else had to be privy to my disgust, but I was angry by this point. I think that the key to good restaurant service is treating a guest like a guest in your home.  That was lacking here to the point that I can only conclude one of three things:  1.  Somebody called off and they had an "off day."   2. The lack of basic service training comes from the top down.  3.  They've got a really crappy server and the rest of their staff is spot on. We don't find ourselves in Ithaca often (read: ever) and so the fact that we'd look elsewhere next time will not hurt their bottom line.  It shouldn't, either.   A lot of places seem to put in the work on the menu & decor, but neglect the aspect of customer service.  Yesterday, I saw a place with a lot of love, hard work and a TON of money put in.  They've got great potential to be a really excellent place.  We may have gotten unlucky on our one experience, and I like the fact that "real" restaurant reviewers will visit a place a few times before making a conclusion, but I can't do that.  Such is YELP and why some owners hate it. Bottom line:  Firing tables at the right time and some service staff training would do a lot to make this a warm, customer-friendly experience that matches up the everything else that they do right.  Most pieces are in place.
I came to visit a friend at Cornell this past weekend, and because she knew that I'm a pretty big foodie and Yelper, she took me here since it's her favorite spot for brunch. First of all, I've got to say that I love the atmosphere. I could definitely see myself going on a date with someone here or even just spending the early day studying there. There's a decent variety of drink options. As for the food, definitely on the costly side, but you can definitely see the effort that's put into the food. The quality of the food that's served is phenomenal--I ordered a simple breakfast sandwich with ham, egg, and cheese. It was served on some pretty yummy toast, and according to my friend, they make everything here fresh so that's always a nice perk. We also tried out the home fries in Carriage House's very own ketchup that I found to be unique and decent. The fries were more like regular potatoes, but they weren't bad. Service is great and ambience is great, so I'm a fan. tldr; come for good brunch!
Best coffee in Ithaca hands down. The breakfasts are spot-on as well. The steak and eggs along with a couple of double espressos are about as good a breakfast as I've had. Only a couple of downsides: - The place is usually full, in fact I went in there this afternoon and couldn't get a table. - Price. Maybe I'm being picky, but  $30+ is a bit steep for breakfast. If I could get out of there for ~$20, I'd be there a couple of times each week.
If I went to college in Ithaca, the Carriage House is the kind of place that I would visit when the parents are in town. ;) We got there early for a weekend brunch since it seemed like the kind of place that fills up fast, which it did. Nearly everyone in our party went with the Omelet special (goat cheese, spinach, sweet potato) and were not disappointed. They had an excellent selection of teas, as well. It's hard to get overly-enthusiastic about brunch, but if you can score a table, the Carriage House should not be missed.
My sister and I lucked out on a Sunday around 1:30PM. We were told it was going to be a 15 minute wait, which we were fine with, but it ended up being only 5 minutes if that! The staff is great and the food here is okay. We had mimosas to start which were very weak. The brie stuffed french toast was decent (although did not live up to its hype) and the vegetarian grilled sandwich was decent. They give you a good amount of food for the price and the place is cute and cozy. For Ithaca, it's a good restaurant. In general, however, it's an okay restaurant.
This place is pretty good for brunch and it has a really nice atmosphere- in an actual old carriage house with vintage decor. Here I usually get a simple egg and cheese sandwhich with over medium eggs- the eggs are always cooked to a perfect over medium, and it is my favorite place to get that one particular thing. I also often split the brioche French toast with someone- it's usually good although one time I got it, one side was still bread. I was disappointed with the brie stuffed French toast though. It was okay I guess but I expected more. I do wish the waitstaff would write things down though- it seems to happen frequently that my order gets mixed up. Scrambled eggs instead of over medium, earl grey tea instead of English breakfast tea twice, etc...
Barista extraordinaire Chris Deferio delivers the most amazing espresso drinks along with Gimme coffee French pressed to order, and amazing food featuring unique flavor combinations. The caf portion is open all day most days to just pop in for a coffee to go. The brunch menu is unfortunately fairly static, but exquisite- yummy scrambled eggs with your choice of 4 cheeses (I got sharp white cheddar). Ridiculously good French toast - 2 big slabs of bread with a solid layer of brie between, covered in a swirl of maple syrup and raspberry coulis (this doesn't sound like it would necessarily be good to me, but trust me, it's a good match). Pretty good design inside, though I would have to call it clean modern meets old carriage house (with them here) plus a dash of Southern Living (huh?) thrown in (which is to say not perfect). Definitely a foodie place; you will most likely have to wait and there will be some unique (but very good) foods and / or combinations, but if you are into food it is well worth it.
Was a little scared about this place after I saw people gave it 1 star. But all in all, it wasn't so bad. For a brunch place, their eggs selection is somewhat limiting and overpriced. Ordered the Salmon LT and my boyfriend had the Cubano sandwich. The salmon is a little weird/bland and I would recommend getting the Cubano instead. Also we shared home fries, which weren't anything special but not bad either. Do not order hot chocolate here. It is just powder! Service was attentive and it was a very cute place decor wise. It wasn't the best brunch ever but it is decent for Ithaca!
Ordered 8 items to go and they forgot one and wouldn't deliver to us. They gave us credit but we were still unhappy about it. The strata was flavorless and had small portions. The Vietnamese BBQ sandwich was good.
Carriage House is definitely one of the best brunch spots in Ithaca . Parents love this place when they visit. Only thing is that it gets very busy on weekends and the wait can be decently long, especially during freshman parent's weekend or other big events. Best thing is to come as early as possible. My go-to order, which is not a very typical brunch dish, is the reuben. My guy friends would always get the steak and eggs. I once had  a special french toast stuffed with nutella and it was a little too heavy for me. Never had any issues with the service. The decor is rustic and the room is decorated with old French posters. One of the tables still has an old sewing pedal attached to it which I thought was cool. Worth stopping by if you're in the area.
This place is a must when you're in Ithaca. Brie stuffed french toast was excellent, coffee was good except not free refill ;) Love the interior with vintage-antique decorations, more in the pricey side but worth it.
Came here for brunch and wow...full of blasting flavor! Me wants more!!! It was a Sunday morning and the fall semester was right around the corner which means a huge crowd. Long lines. But it was worth every minute. I ordered the tofu VIETNAMESE BANH Ml. And you must order this!! It blends in so well. Every bite! Plus the bread was great! Chewy but not gum chewy. Taste so fresh. I'm a huge fan of carbs - which explains why my thighs dance while I walk. =x I also ordered the grilled veggies sandwich and I don't suggest that unless you are looking for something plain. It tastes exactly how it sounds like. Veggies that are grilled placed in between bread with a smear of spread.
So to start off, I wanted to dock this place another star due to the prices but the meal I ordered makes this place deserving of 4 stars. I went for lunch with a friend 45 minutes before they closed and the server was very accommodating and still let us sit in for some lunch as I've been wanting to try this place so badly for a while now. The atmosphere is very cool, very homey and it really makes you think that you really aren't in Ithaca for the moment which was very cool. The place was a bit small and the tables are glass so be careful coming here if you have children. The server was nice, took our drink order and our lunch order and it came out within 15 minutes which is standard and is good, It gave my friend and I some time to talk which was nice. I like when food is fast but being too fast defeats the purpose of going out sometimes. Anyways I ordered the Banh Mi. This was my 2nd ever Banh Mi so I don't have a good comparison for this yet but let me tell you, this won my sandwich of the month and maybe year award! The bread was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside which is my favorite way to have it especially when eating a sandwich. They piled so much teriyaki bbq chicken on this sandwich it was literally falling out, which i liked because usually they skimp on the meats. The cabbage, cilantro, sweet chili sauce, and chili mayo were amazing accompaniments to this sandwich and the flavors were just astounding. Sweet yet a little kick with that cilantro to really bring in that herby taste. Then the crunch of the cabbage to complement the soft chicken. They really got this one right let me tell you. This was and is easily the best Banh Mi I've had yet and will now use this as the comparisons for others which is going to be a tough one to beat I think. My friend got the burger which I almost got. This is another reason they get notched a star. Now people know me as the burger guy, and my friend is just as picky as I am. The burger was small and the entire size of everything with the burger was half as big as my Banh Mi. He said he would've eaten two of them and he's a small guy. They had cheese and onions on it but very little tomato puree and no lettuce. To me a burger needs toppers. Since when do people think that putting meat and a sauce with onions on a bun is a burger? Are you people taking crazy pills? Burgers were meant to have toppings, they live for toppings. You need a crunch when eating a burger so just a pile of bread and meat which is mush in your mouth.This is really disappointing because as I ordered my sandwich I was thinking "Next time I'ma gonna try that burger!" and now....I will definitely not. He said the meat was really tender, cooked to his liking and had flavor but come on. It was meat on a bun pretty much. No one likes that. Overall I would come back here but not often as lunch for the two of us which just consisted of water and 2 meals came to almost $30. This is a place that maybe every few months I would come back to for a Banh Mi and I do want to try it for brunch. If the prices were $1-$2 less on everything I think they would draw others in more often and I would definitely return more. I recommend you try this place but you'll definitely agree this won't be your go to lunch place, you'll be broke haha.
I've only eaten lunch and brunch/breakfast here. It does have a unique and lovely interior.  Glass tables with upper-end decorating magazines stowed below - for your browsing pleasure.  Tables aren't too squished together.  There's a piano in the corner.  Lemon-scented water filled and refilled upon arrival.  Seasonal menus printed on nice stock.  Lovely espresso drinks topped with designs worthy of those Food Network competitions. It is, as others have noted, expensive.  Almost a little too expensive?  I mean, an Asian salad (made with top-notch greens and ingredients, to be fair) is maybe 7 bucks - but if you want the salmon on top, add another 6 or 9 bucks?!?  Yikes.  A sandwich for $10?   Then again, I pay $9 for a dirty martini without complaining.  So, in this perspective, paying $10-$15 for a well-dressed salad or sandwich isn't really that bad.  And with the Starbucks faction charging $4+ for a cappuccino made by people who couldn't care less (no offense - I was a barista at Seattle's Best, okay), a $3.5 or $4 lovely, foamy, artistic coffee drink in a ceramic cup and saucer seems like we are guilty of the rip-off. The food is, well, picturesque.  Fare you could photo and put in Food & Wine.  Crusty breads.  Top-notch condiments - no French's or Heinz here!  Brie, Emmenthaler, creme fraiche -- these are the staples at the Carriage House.  If you want an artisan soup and sandwich combo made with sometimes challenging - but always tasty - combinations, you can't go wrong here. My friends and I often have our extended lunches here, and the staff is always very attentive and kind, taking 2nd or 3rd coffee orders without balking or sighing.
Wow oh wow, to put it simply, Carriage House is tasty. There's something special about this place I can't really put my hands on. There are few amazing restaurants in the ithaca area, and Carriage House is just one of them. I was honestly debating whether or not I was going to put this down as a four star or a five star, but just decided to put it down as a four star. The downsides to Carriage House though are the really high prices and the ridiculous waiting time for the food to come out. Despite this, the atmosphere is really quaint and comfortable, the food presentation and taste is out of this world, and there simply is no better place to get brunch in this area. Go with brie stuffed french toast, breakfast sandwich, reuben, and burger.
I still very much enjoy Carriage House, but I'm docking a star off for my most recent experience and the poor service. My three friends and I arrived around 12:30 on a Saturday. The host told us that the wait would be about an hour long or possibly shorter if people ahead of us decided to leave instead of waiting. We headed upstairs to wait where there were some photography books to look at. My friends and I continued to question why Carriage House didn't use that space to hold more tables (as mentioned in my original review as well). We were pleasantly surprised to have our name called at 1:00pm: a half hour wait is not too shabby for Saturday brunch for one of the most popular brunch spots in Ithaca. We were seated right away and were given menus by the aforementioned host. We all decided what we wanted within 5 minutes, but we were not greeted by a server at all. When we tried to find out which server was ours, every waitress seemed to avert their eyes to avoid eye contact and pretend to not hear us calling for assistance. I finally managed to get the attention of one waitress, and we were able to place our orders twenty minutes after sitting! That's madness! The wait to place our order was probably the biggest damper on my experience. I started off with a mochaccino. TIP: if any of you are FourSquare users, check into Carriage House, and you can get a free coffee/tea product! I got a free mochaccino, and it was heartwarming. They made a lovely heart-shaped design with the foamed milk, and it had the perfect amount of sugar added to the smooth chocolate coffee combination. I ended up ordering the Smoked Salmon "LT" and a side of home fries. The smoked salmon "LT" had a house-cured pastrami-style lox, grainy-dijon mayo, sundried tomato paste, and local greens on nine-grain bread with a small salad with a house vinaigrette. I inhaled the first half of the sandwich because I was starving, but as I managed to get through the second half, I realized that the bread was very hard, and the entire sandwich was extremely salty. I ended up not being able to finish the second half as the saltiness was unbearable. I will still probably return to Carriage House because I enjoy the food, and it is a very cute spot, but they need to work on their service. I understand that it gets busy, but the least you can do is greet us and let us know that you'll be with us to take our order soon.
My friend and I went here for a late brunch, and if anything makes me wish I lived in Ithaca, it's the Carriage House. I love the decor; it's eclectic and a little funky.  Our "table" was actually an ancient stove accessorized with a carefully placed stack of old LPs. We both ordered the brie-stuffed french toast and garlic home fries.  Unbelievable.  The food actually inspired me to take a photo and post it on Facebook so all of my friends could be jealous.  :)  The french toast was flavorful and chewy, and the brie was skillfully melted.  The home fries were perfectly savory. We did hit one snag - my home fries came out with our entrees, but my friend's side dish took an extra 10 minutes or so to get to the table.  Our server was nice about it and took it off the check, though.  We absolutely loved our brunch. A couple things to keep in mind: - They charge for coffee refills, which I think is kind of lame.  I think it's something like 85 cents per refill. - Get here either super early, or at the end of brunch (and I'm repeating what our server told us).  They don't take reservations, and the waiting list can sometimes stretch to two hours.   - Like many small restaurants, the Carriage House is closed Mondays. Enjoy!
Great ambiance- but don't come there for the weekend brunch unless you're prepared.  It can get noisy and crowded.   Definitely: come here for pastries and coffee/tea any other time of day.  It is a fabulous place to sit and chat with friends.
