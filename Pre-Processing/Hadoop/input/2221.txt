We heard good things about this place so we decided to check it out. It was Saturday night at 10:30 pm and the place was pretty empty since it was summer time. We were a group of 3 and once we walked in we stood there for a few minutes without anyone acknowledging us so we thought it was self-seating. It took another 5 minutes for someone to give us menus where we told that we would have drinks first then food. Then another 10-15 minutes past before we finally hailed down the waiter only for them to say that if wanted drinks to go to the bar. Service was extremely rude and unhelpful. Definitely won't be coming back.

Overall: Certainly one of the better casual places in Ithaca with unique character, but some room for improvement. The good: Inexpensive and yummy beer flights, good variety on the menu, generally pretty tasty, and all around a pretty good value. Some of the items tasted really fresh and delicious. Had the cajun shrimp  on grits waffles which tasted good. A good casual date spot. The bad: I'm sort of a stickler for good lighting, and this place didn't have it. Unevenly dim and some florescent-type stuff going on in the display case. Sat next to the air conditioner and it was really too drafty. Also the chairs and tables sort of reminded me of a cafeteria.  Also, I swore the berry cobbler was microwaved? The topping wasn't crispy at all, but was just a sugary mush. And the grits waffles were really heavy. The bun on the veggie burger was way too dense too. I really want to believe in this place because I think they are doing some things really well and they fill a niche in Ithaca eating that I was really missing. With a few improvements, this place could easily stand head and shoulders above every other place in Ithaca.

Bandwagon is good for stopping by and having a snack and a beer to go with it. They also serve some food until late. The bandwagon fries in particular are really good. The house brewed beers are unfortunately hit or miss and should probably be a dollar cheaper. Happy hour from 10PM to close ($1 off house drafts) is convenient.

Well shucks, after living in Ithaca for over a year and exhausting my dinning options I gave Bandwagon another try.  I've gotta admit I had it wrong with these guys, or maybe they worked out a lot of their kinks since they have been open.  I would now put them in my top 5 Ithaca restaurants.  Why not 5 stars?  Well, though their beer has improved ten fold, their food reached a consistant level of tasty, and their late night bar scene is totally my jam I still want to give them a little push to keep working at it.  These guys are clearly bound for excellence, and I don't want to sell them short of it.

The atmosphere was nice.  The beer was mixed - for example, the oatmeal stout is runny and thin; but others were fine (very mixed reviews on the raspberry jalapeno).  The food all over all, though, is a bit of a disappointment.  At best, their dishes are just ok - I ate with 4 others, and we had a range of dishes (burger, catfish, salad, mussels and pasta).  Other dishes were salty, a bit greasy, or just didn't have the flavor expected given the ingredients.  And the salad dressing is pretty awful - gummy is really the best word for it. Best way to look at it: go for the beer, find food some place else. The quality is not worth the price.

3.5 stars. The food is creative and innovative in concept, but sometimes it just doesn't hit the mark in terms of execution. The hand cut fries with catsup, malt vinegar aioli & curry mayonnaise ($5.50) were pretty good. The shrimp, andouille, spinach, & cherry tomatoes in red pepper-chili sauce over cornmeal waffle ($17) is one of their most popular items, but I didn't think it was amazing, it was just alright. Service was decent. Decor is nothing special, it'd be great for a casual lunch or dinner with a group. I might come back in a couple years after they've worked out the kinks with their food.

Visiting Ithaca with friends for an alumni event at IC, and looking to try something new since most of our old haunts on the Commons are no longer in existence. Initially seated quickly, but then forgotten about. Took a little while before we got a server, and someone in our party had to get up and ask for one from the hostess, but he was great. Fries appetizer was yummy. They had gluten free stuff, which was great for my friend with celiac disease, and the waiter really knew what had what in it for her. The caramel bacon sundae was a very interesting combination of things I wouldn't have combined but was fantastic! I tried a flight of their beers. only eh, and I usually like craft beers. Don't know if it'll survive in Ithaca, but I'd go back the next time I'm up.

Bandwagon is hands-down my favorite restaurant in Ithaca, and the one where we usually take out-of-towners if we don't want to get super fancy. It is moderately priced, has a cool stone-basement sort of atmosphere, they do their specialties well and mix in a few seasonal dishes, and they have a very decent menu as well. My husband brews his own beer and while he said that Bandwagon's own beers were a little hit or miss, he usually sticks to the other flights being offered. I'm not a huge beer drinker, but the featured cocktails and wine I've ordered have always been good. The service is consistently above par and as someone who drinks water like there is no tomorrow, it's really nice that my glass is always refilled before I can even finish it. I also applaud them for trying their best to accommodate the groups of students who come in and expect to be able to add more and more seats to a table as their friends show up late. Come on, this isn't Applebee's--make a reservation if you think you are going to have a large group. Bandwagon's food is delicious--I've never ordered a meal that I didn't like--and they try to locally source as much of their food as they can (especially the meat). One of their signature dishes is the shrimp, andouille, spinach, and cherry tomatoes in a red pepper and cream sauce over cornmeal waffles. Definitely try this! It's really rich and I've never actually seen anyone finish the whole thing (hmmm future Man vs. Food challenge?) but it is a real treat. Their housemade pecan, bean and barley burger is also amazing, either traditionally in a bun or over one of their salads. I was brave and tried the habanero fettucine once--just so that I could say that I did--and will never do it again. If spicy food is your thing and you want to heed the disclaimer on the menu, then by all means have at it. But as a fellow lover of spicy foods, I found it strangely spicy and bland at the same time--maybe it was SO spicy that it completely wiped out any of the other flavors--and I had to drink a Cayuga Lake's-worth of water to even finish half of it.

Bandwagon is a good place to go with a small group.  It has a nice clean atmosphere with plenty of space.  Their menu is heavy on the spicy foods for some reason, but they have some interesting dishes.  The beef tenderloin with garlic mashed potatoes was great.  I've also heard that their jalapeno/berry beer is supposed to be good, but they were out when I went.  The North by Northwest beer is a good brown ale.  Also, if you're looking for a starter, check out the breaded and fried swiss cheese with spicy marinara sauce.

Great home-brewed beer, food, wines...perfect underground pub atmosphere...only complaint is too-pungent (bean) veggie burger

Bandwagon brews Cornell university's official beer called Ezra's Red ale. It's unbelievable and a must try if you are in the area

For now, Bandwagon is good enough, but could definitely improve. I eat there at least once a month. I've had issues with their in-house brews tasting flat when I get them. Once it took nearly 10 minutes to get a beer, it was clearly the bottom of the barrel (literally), and it tasted dreadful. I would have rather ordered a different beer if given the choice. The food I enjoy, but find the portion sizes to fluctuate too often. I was also disappointed when not once, but on two different occasions, I was charged for an entree salad when I ordered a salad as my appetizer The sever never even asked which size I wanted. I know this seems petty, but I think there's a big difference between a $7 and a $11 salad. If you get the fries, the Malt Vinegar Aioli is pretty tasty. The check gets expensive quickly so unless you have lots of money to spend, choose wisely. They are open late for Ithaca standards, and you can find something to satisfy you even on their late night menu which they offer until 1am. Very convenient to say the least. Lastly, watch your step when you are going up or down the stairs to enter the restaurant. It's slippery when wet, and I've seen lots and lots of people trip up the steps on their way out. Sit on the benches outside long enough, and you're bound to catch a glimpse of this phenomenon.

I love this place! Service gets a little slow when it's busy but the food is well worth the wait. Try the fries if they're on the menu when you go.

Was not pleased with the service AT ALL. After sitting at the bar it took 7 minutes for the bartender to stop having social hour and acknowledge us. After that it was 25 minutes from the time that we sat down until we got our first beers. The place wasn't overly busy either. No excuse for this!  The beers were good however, only saving grace from 1 star.

Really cool underground spot on Cayuga Street just around the corner from the State Theater, so a good spot for pre and post show partying.  They have about 15 to 20 draft selections, with about 6 of those being house brews.  I went with the Ballast Point Sea Monster Imperial Stout which could be one of the best of that variety I have ever tried.  The space is dimly lit and cozy with small wooden tables, a glass case on one wall displaying old copper beer canisters and other historical beer artifacts, very cool.  Tried the boneless chicken tenders which came in a generous mound, deliciously hot and crisp, if a bit messy, with some Asian spice I couldn't quite put my finger on, and came with large bowl of great blue cheese dressing. Also tried wontons with potato filling.  Three extra large fried wontons overstuffed came with a sour cream dipping sauce.  Would have liked 6 or 8 smaller wontons as these began to fall apart due to being oversized as we ate them.  Will definitely be back, my kind of place.

This has become one of my favorite places in Ithaca.  The food and beer are good and reasonably priced and the atmosphere is very down to earth. Definitely worth checking out.

Interesting beers. It seems like lots small brew pubs can't get many right but we had the flight and I'd order a pint or two of most of them. The jalapeno raspberry was odd but I was expecting that so no big surprise, I like spicy beers and fruity beers but not in the same glass... The food was great. It was also a decent portion but not obscene. The waitstaff were also super friendly. We'll definitely be going back!

Wonderful emphasis on local, fresh, sustainable foods.  Their meats are always local and most veggies too depending on the seasons. Cool ambiance, great food, and amazing service.  Plus, I recently learned they serve (technically a limited menu but it's nearly half of the main courses and every appetizer) until late.  I usually get their chicken pasta dish full of vegetables, or their local 1/2 pound burger, a serious steal at about 10 bucks with a side of fresh cut fries. It is a smaller place so call ahead for reservations to be on the safe side. Seriously though, go to this restaurant!!

unique good-tasting beer and good food. i liked it.
Fantastic place with knowledgable staff. The menu is unique with something for everyone. Also, they played awesome music from Michael Jackson to Huey Lewis to Talking Heads. That definitely makes for an upbeat experience.
Rude!! The worst service for mediocre food & drinks anywhere! My fiancé and I arrived fashionably late to a dinner party for one of his classmates. We were given two chairs which were casually thrown at the head of the table. A few minutes later a few more people showed up so my fiancé and I scooted down as the other guests added 2 tables and some chairs. After being ignored when they walked in, a rude blonde haired girl comes up to the new addition of guests and very rudely proclaims they cannot add anymore tables or chairs due to "fire hazard" clearance. When we asked how we could figure out a way to fix our dinner party, she rudely answers back, " you can't! You reserved for a party of 10 NOT 20!"  Wow! I have NEVER been to a place that was angry that they were getting more customers than expected. If you're going to use store bought bread pudding and water down your mixed drinks, you better have KILLER service.
I really liked Bandwagon Brew Pub... very comfortable ambiance, good service, and really good food.  I had a burger that was excellent, and I really enjoyed the raspberry jalapeno beer.  I will definitely come back, as I think this is a great place to hang out with friends and enjoy a night out.  Try their fries with curry mayonnaise, they are excellent!
Just an update: They are now making their own ginger-ale and it is fabulous!!
Great Beer, great service, & delicious food.  This place rocks.  I love the underground location in the catacombs!  The split between the bar/lounge space and dining room is great because you can have two very different experiences when you visit.  I prefer to eat a sit-down dinner first then move to the adjacent lounge for drinks.  They pride themselves on using fresh local and organic ingredients.  Very foodie friendly!  The cornmeal waffles with spicy shrimp anduille is killer!  Their burgers are amazing....HUGE and incredibly juicy.  The french fries (appetizer portion) are THE BEST IN TOWN.  I've also had the spicy habanero pasta.  It's a must try if you have high spice tolerance and are looking for a challenge.  I really enjoyed it but it's not for lightweights!  I'm thrilled that Ithaca is hopping on the Craft Beer Bandwagon!  I brew beer at home and moved here from San Diego which has arguably the strongest craft beer culture in the country.  I don't think I would have chosen to go to school here if I hadn't visited this place and recognized that Ithaca truly does love beer and good food.

Great Beer! Great Food! Great Atmosphere! Heavenly fries and sauces are a must eat every time I go. When I'm there for dinner I get their amazing burgers, made with local ground beef, topped with swiss garlic mayo, homemade stout mustard, lettuce, tomato, onion and a pickle. You just can't go wrong here. The atmosphere is a mix of college students, young professionals, professors, awesome locals and all around good natured people. Its basement setting is perfect for staying cool in the summer and enjoying time with friends.

Unfortunately, I must take two stars off my previous review. Don't think I do this lightly either. As you may be able to tell from the review below, this was my favorite place in Ithaca (in case that didn't come across). I've been a loyal customer since they first opened. This is why I feel that I need to update my review. Over the past year the quality of the food has gone consistently downhill. I want to be clear, the food is still not bad, but the glorious basement bar with interesting food and beer seems to have died and been replaced by an adequately dark bar with some pretty good wings (seriously if you go here get the wings). If you're a college student looking to hang out and have some good beer and pub grub, by all means go here. If you're looking to sit down and have a meal (and a few drinks) there are other... better (it hurts to type this)... options in Ithaca. P.S. I also have to warn against the catfish (in its current form). I had to try it several times to be sure, but the massive fish cuts that once were lovingly wrapped in their golden crispy deep fried skin, have been exchanged for what appears to be fish jerky.

We picked this spot to celebrate a birthday. We started with a beer flight and a 14 year aged scotch. They have lots of interesting craft brews. Good times. Reached out to the server to ask about our appetizer. He assured us it should be coming out shortly and ran to the kitchen. He walked out holding our entrees instead. "The kitchen lost the ticket.." he claimed. This is usually code for "I forgot to put in your order." The curry was a boring, bland mush. Colorless and lacking flavor. The presentation was decent but there was almost no flavor. I wouldn't order it again. The waffles entree is the standout dish here. It's a cornmeal waffle cooked crispy to hold up to the amazing sauce. Shrimp, andouille sausage, spinach, onions and tomatoes in a red pepper-chili cream sauce. The flavors popped and the presentation was excellent. A real winner. The steak course was a ribeye with combination butter, garlic mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables. The mashed was boring but the steak had flavor. To finish our meal we ordered the apple & pear crisp on the recommendation of the server. The fruit tasted fresh and wasn't overcooked as is common. The taste of cinnamon really came through but wasn't overpowering. Light and tasty. A nice end to the meal.

The taste of cinnamon really came through but wasn't overpowering. Light and tasty. A nice end to the meal.
This place is a little hard to notice if your just walking by it on the street since its a basement level restaurant but you should go out of your way to try this place out.  It has great food and a good selection of beer.  The service is pretty spot on as well. I would say the only downfall that this place has is that there isn't much room.

Bandwagon has changed in the last few months. Instead of being a restaurant, it feels more like a bar. Came in about a week ago and didn't know if they were still offering table service. We tried to ask a waitress, but she wasn't very helpful/clear about how to order and literally threw two menus down on our (dirty) table. Normally, I would chalk this up to a busy night, but the service has been off for a few months now. We felt awkward and left. Used to like this place for a flight and a burger, but we won't be back.

The food was meh. My burger was not cooked the way I asked and the macaroni and cheese was awwwful. The service is dreadful. We ordered appetizers and the empty plates were still in the table when we were finished eating our meals, not to mention empty glasses. The server didn't even get everyone at the table a glass of water! And walked past our empty glasses multiple times. The one time he came over, he asked if everything was fine. We all looked at one another, nervous to say anything, and then said, "Pretty good? Okay!" and walked away. At the end of the meal, he set the check on top of a pile of dirty plates! I don't live in Ithaca anymore, but I used to and loved this place. The people I came with said they'd never come back. Avoid it like the plague.

Always enjoy going to Bandwagon's. Pros: - great beers, a lot of them local, can get flights - great food, healthy and unhealthy stuff, love the spinach artichoke dip (not healthy) - perfect location - cozy basement setting & good vibes Cons: - don't accept reservations on weekends - usually a wait on weekends, which I've often found to be like 30 minutes - service is hit or miss...I've had fantastic servers and other ones that left much to be desired - usually LOUD. Stone walls.

Our experience was mediocre at best.  We almost left because our waitress was m.i.a. quite frequently.  We got a few appetizers and a few beers.  The fritters were way over fried and we were next to a greasy air vent that was sending up a full blast of cold air.  The dingy banner outside is a pretty good sign of what you'll find inside.

Bandwagon has always been a must visit for us when visiting Ithaca - and has usually delivered...until last night. The food and service have gone way downhill. The menu has changed and is focused more on burgers than entrees. Which would be fine if the burgers were good. But they are not. Medium rare orders come out well done. Buns come out chewy and soggy. Fried chicken comes out dry and tasteless. The service is very poor. Requests for condiments and forks require multiple requests. Waitress could not answer basic questions about the menu. They lost my credit card after paying - fortunately only temporary. The seating was haphazard and inefficient. One bright spot - the beer and drinks continue to deliver. While the dinner options in Ithaca are limited, not sure we will be coming back to Bandwagon on our next visit.

I went here with a large group after playing a concert. It was a Tuesday night and got very very crowded by around 11pm. I don't remember anything at all about the food (not because of the beers, just because it wasn't memorable), except that it was 3-dollar fries night. The beer list is good- lots of local, interesting stuff I haven't seen many places. My friend ordered a gin drink and received a glass of water.... it was remedied eventually. The service is ok- our waitress was really nice but overwhelmed. The bartender was having some issues.

Quality has gone way down. Food still great, but beer is not good. Consistently lukewarm, not very well carbonated, and has a nice soapy aftertaste signaling they rarely clean their taps. New head brewer has good ideas but is not good at brewing. I rarely come here anymore because of all that, and if I do I always get one of way overpriced non-bandwagon beers. $6 for a pint of non-bandwagon beer is absurd but at least it tastes somewhat better. A year ago I would recommend, but not anymore.

I love the food at Bandwagon! However, I have a food allergy and every time I visit - three times now - I have had to send my food back not once, not twice, but 3 times because they send it out with the allergen still on my burger. By the time I get to eat, my friends have long finished their meals. I don't get it; it's pretty easy to read a ticket and leave items off a burger. If you have allergies, don't eat here. The kitchen clearly doesn't get the danger of their carelessness. If it had only happened once, I'd give them another chance. But three strikes? I'm out.

Nice selection of beer. A lot of college kids -- to be expected. Good food to accompany beer. We had the cheese plate, and I had their chicken curry soup of the day, and the beet salad. The beer flights are nicely presented and a good deal. I tried one of their IPAs and the raspberry jalapeño, and both were good. Service is a bit harried and slow, but OK. Would definitely go back -- very comfortable.

We stopped in here after meeting some of the folks at a local charity event where they did a beer tasting. Our initial impressions were good, so we decided to visit the brew pub. As with some other brew pubs I've been to (nationally, really, not just in Ithaca), they are making some great beers and this is the high point of the place. Execution on service and food are not quite there. The service was just OK--quite slow and lacking personal attention, but mildly friendly. I mentioned that we met some of their folks at a recent event and the server kind of went, "Oh.... oh, OK. Well, that wasn't me." Awkward. I wasn't calling in a favor or anything, I was just mentioning how we discovered the place. The food was just middle-of-the-road, nothing special. I would visit again, but for the beer only. The hefeweizen is quite good; the irish stout is unremarkable. I would like to try some others.

My favorite restaurant in Ithaca. A big fan of the rotating beer selection. The second Tuesday of every month there is a free tasting of all the home-brewed drafts. There are also flights you can order to get a sampling of the brews. Flavors are inventive and constantly rotating so every time you will be able to order something different. As far as food goes I usually come for wing night (every Tuesday) which also has a rotating menu of flavors. The best flavor is sesame-sriracha. You can order one set of wings but get half one flavor and half another. Their regular menu (also rotating monthly) is as well delicious. Everything is fresh and perfectly cooked. Where Bandwagon really excels is in their sauces. Even the ketchup is home made and the fries come with ketchup, aioli, and curry mayonnaise. Would recommend to anyone.

Bandwagon is the restaurant in Ithaca we frequent most often.  Not only is it conveniently located right off the commons, but they also have a good selection of microbrews (both their own and others) on tap!  It's in the basement, which feels nice and cozy in the winter and cool and refreshing in the summer humidity. About half of the beers on tap are brewed by them, and the menu is always arranged in four convenient tasters.  Recently they added a seasonal/experimental Bandwagon taster which I really appreciate.  As someone's who has been there any number of times, it's a great way to taste their new beers.   Some of my favorites: High Step, High Step Aged in Bourbon Barrels (very delicious and who knows how long it will be around), River Belly Oatmeal Stout, and the Hidden Rabbit Hefeweizen.   Favorite dishes: Beet Salad and the Chicken Tenders. We also recently discovered their Friday evening happy hour deals on Appetizers ($5 for a subset of appetizers until 6pm), which makes it even better of a deal. If you enjoy trying new beers and enjoying a nice relaxed drink/dinner with friends, I've found that Bandwagon is great place to go!

Great veggie burger that didn't seem like it was trying to taste like meat (which I think is the worst... If I'm ordering a veggie burger it's because I don't want to eat something that tastes like meat...) Good selection of ciders, which I enjoyed. Great atmosphere too. I'd go back for sure!

This is definitely my favorite place in Ithaca. Located right off the commons, Bandwagon boasts a rotating 15 craft beers and 5 house made brews at a time. I highly recommend their pumpkin beer. Bandwagon also has great food, too! The fries are legendary. I recently tried the spinach artichoke dip which was so creamy and so awesome. I think one of the biggest reasons I always come back to Bandwagon is the atmosphere and service. There are some cool couch areas as well as tables to sit at. The staff is also friendly and willing to answer any questions you have. Oh, also, if you've had one too many beers, I recommend ordering a Blue Dolphin with Icebergs.

This place used to have good guest ales, but now they only sell their own beer which is often quite disgusting. Raspberry jalepeno tastes like it sounds. They also offer cucumber, beets, strawberry, and water melon varieties, but as yet nothing flavored with 'taste of good beer'. If you are especially brave, try the sour ale. It either went wrong or they were aiming for a flavor that could have been achieved more economically with the aid of two digits down the throat. Others are less offensive but often somewhat watery. One exception is the weizenbock which is surprisingly good. A couple of others are drinkable too, but with 15 home brews on the menu the odds are against you! The staff are all lovely, but the beer just isn't.

The food was really good. Had the waffles  Great tasting.   Service was really bad even my Ithaca standards.   Really long wait for service.   For a busy restaurant you think they would want to turn the table over. Longest waiting for check tagged that I've had in years.

Delicious burgers!   Try the sweet potato wedges! Next time I will order a flight to taste more of their beers.

Solid list of their own beers, with a few nice, largely NY-centric guest taps. I had their 2013 Harvest Ale. Service was decent, although the bartender seemed a bit distracted and disengaged. Definitely would go back next time I'm in Ithaca!

Food was good. Beer was OK. Need to try again and see if it was just an off night for the beer.

I ate here last week for a friend's birthday. I didn't bring ID, and they refused to serve me a glass of wine. I'm 30 years old and don't look underage. I found this behaviour ridiculous. As I was with a large party, I couldn't leave to go elsewhere. Screw these people. Food was standard. Not bad, but nothing special.

With Bandwagon, its kind of hit or miss in a lot of aspects. If you come during dinner hours, they DON'T take reservations (at least thats what they told us, on here it says they do, maybe the policy has changed recently) and they are always packed with people who sit for hours and just drink beer. The host told us 45 minutes for a party of 4 on a Thursday night, and an hour and a half later we went and got food at Asia Cuisine because we hadn't even been seated (or offered a drink at the waiting area) I've also eaten here when the wait wasn't that bad-- maybe 20 minutes for a two top table. The food was decent--I got a burger and my lady friend got the cornbread waffle with some sort of spicy cream sauce and shrimp. Hers was good, mine was just "meh" average for what I paid for it.I ordered it medium rare and it came to me well done,not a huge deal but why even bother asking how you want it cooked if thats not how it'll come out? I feel like I could've gone somewhere else, like a divey sort of bar, and gotten a much better burger for half that price. I probably won't go back for the food, but who knows. I'm prtty picky when it comes to food because I'm a chef. The beer is pretty good. Some of the stouts we had seemed runny for a stout. Usually with a stout you expect more body than that, you know? But overall I would give the beer a 4/5. Servers are generally pretty knowledgeable about them, so thats a plus. Overall, yes, I would return, but never for food, and only during a time when it wouldn't be jam-packed, like an early afternoon or weeknight.

Went for dinner with two friends to sample their home brewed beer and try the food. The beer was pretty novel, the jalapeno raspberry and watermelon lagers were nice but a pint is too much of either. The food was expensive for what it was. Not memorable either. The fries were the highlight, definitely recommended. The atmosphere was nice, and the waitress was attentive and refilled the waters quite often. She however felt the need to put a 18% gratuity on the bill, even though we were a party of 3. Although it's not much money, it is the act of forcing a tip that we would have left anyway, if not more, that was insulting. I would not return to bandwagon.

Everyone's go- to here is the fry plate. They have good food, pretty expensive alcohol list for what you can find around but it's a nice, laid back environment on a weekday. Weekends it's a fun place to get a drink in an environment where you can talk. Overall, kinda spendy, can get packed on weekends, but great place to hang out and drink or eat.

Happy hour is shockingly from 10pm -1am, which is great. Finally a happy hour for the night owls! Discounts on all home brewed pints and well drinks. They brew some decent beers here, but they also brew some pretty terrible ones. I really like the north by northwest, but my favorite is the Strawberry Jalapeno. This beer is not smokey like your traditional chipotle/spicy porters, its a bit lighter, crisper, and dare I say spicier. While its not that spicy, a spicy drink can really get you compared to spicy food, as it tingles a bit down the throat. This beer is not for the faint of heart, and its quite unusual, most people either love it or hate it. Unfortunately, usually I have to settle for the raspberry jalapeno beer, which is not as good, as I have not seen them serve the strawberry one since the first time I tried it. As for the food, the focaccia bread I had here was raw in the center (gross!), but I love their fries which come with 3 different types of dipping sauce, of which my favorite is the curry aoli. The fries are a bit soggy though, but for some reason this doesn't really bother me. My favorite food item here is their buffalo chicken tenders.

Yikes!!  When I am in a new town, I always like to check out some of the local brews.  So I stopped at Bandwagon and ordered a flight of their house beer.  It tasted like bad home brew made with extract.  The most palatable was the rye IPA, but that was still only mediocre at best.  I would definitely steer clear of their beers. To be fair though, they had lots of other quality beers (and beer flights) available and I enjoyed the atmosphere.  If I were in Ithaca again, I would stop in for something other than their brews.

I can't rate it higher than this because of my very odd experience with a certain notorious pasta. But I'll get to that. So I tried Bandwagon beers for the first time at AppleFest. The raspberry jalapeño beer was great, but the oatmeal stout was AMAZING. Off to a good start. Took my boyfriend here for his birthday, since he'd been once before and raved about the fish & chips. We were both hugely impressed with the pecan/barley veggie burger, which had aioli and green curry paste that brought it to another level. The fries with it were also incredible (I'm picky about fries). Here's where it gets weird. There's a pasta on the menu that comes with a disclaimer because it's spicy. It has habanero, banana, pineapple, etc. Sounds weird right? ...CHALLENGE ACCEPTED. Except...oh my gosh, it was terrifying. It was spicy, sure, but also just the weirdest flavors ever and not in a good way. We both pretended to like it for a few bites, then I totally gave up. He kept at it for a few more minutes and then also gave up. This is one of the first legitimately bad dishes I've ever had. And they warned us on the menu, so it's our own fault. But really, it threw off my entire night and I wouldn't recommend it. Everything else was good but don't get the fruity pasta.

My favorite bar in Ithaca. Get a flight of the Bandwagon Beer (yes, they brew their own beer) and sit back with some friends with a few orders of fries. That is what I call a GOOD night!

Came in here as a grumpy bunch after a morning of things not going our way. Despite being (once again) disappointed that their kitchen wouldn't be open for another three hours, the bartender was super friendly and nice and made sure we were well fed with chex mix while we tried some beers. Favorites:  Their Scotch Ale and 3 Heads's Smoked Maple Amber.   Bottom line: We were super happy another hour or so later. It seems that everyone who works there is just genuinely super nice, which is kind of a rare thing. We will definitely be returning for food.

Different aspects to comment on: The food is quite good. Reasonably priced, reasonably local, and reasonable variety. The service is quite good The beer is a mixed bag. The guest taps from other breweries are interesting and you can try them as part of a sampler. The beers they make in-house are pretty blah. The surroundings are dark and comfortable, being in a basement of course, but beware of rainy days. Being in a basement with exposed rock walls tends to make the the place smell kind of funky. 2 our of three times I have visited it was raining and the aroma was musty and public pool like (I think they need to coat the brick walls i some clear coat to keep the moisture at bay, just a thought). Worth a visit if you are in Ithaca (along with the chapter house and Ithaca brewing if you are in town to try beer).

After getting a great review from a local bartender to try this place out we just had to go. We have the atomsphere-it remindes us of a place in Syracuse called Empire- Its downstairs and the walls have natural brick showing and they brew their own beers! We have a watermelon beer and it was delish, my BF loved it. We did not eat we just enjoyed drinks BUT the bartender whos shift just ended order at poor boy and oooooh that looked soooo good!!!~ A stop is a must when in DT Ithaca!

I liked this place.  First we got a bowl of the butternut squash and pear soup--delicious.  But I'm generally a fan of those sorts of soup.  I've never seen that combo before though.  The thing I really liked is that there were veggies on the menu, not just fried potatoes, cheese, and meat.  We got the brussels sprouts and they were good too.  I'm not usually one for super salty dishes (this one has garlic and sea salt mixed in with the brussels sprouts) but since the salt was a showcased flavor, I think this worked. Next, I got the chicken with grilled onions and peppers and polenta and my husband got the shrimp and andouille sausage with an awesome creamy spicy sauce...I forget the exact names of the entrees.  Both were excellent.  The chicken was (thankfully) not over cooked, it was moist and super tender.  The sauce the shrimp and sausage dish came in was incredible. Since the meal was working out, we decided to get a dessert to share too.  We tried the pineapple and blueberry crunchy cake (I forget what it was called too) and it was super tasty also.  Delightful, in fact. And then there's the beer.  We each got a pint of their own brewed beer: a jalapeno raspberry and a chocolate cherry porter.  We both liked them.  The jalapeno raspberry one had a strong jalapeno flavor which I felt made it unique--I haven't had many chili sort of beers and the chocolate cherry porter was nicely balanced in flavor. The staff were attentive and timely too.  Overall, a great experience.

I've only eaten here once so far, but they nailed it - it was awesome.  I ate there with three other people, and I think that the fact that we all practically licked each and every plate clean (apps, entrees, and desserts!) is definitely saying something.  I had actually been reluctant to go - not being a fan of basements and I was thinking that it was much smaller than it is.  They really did a nice job with that space though - it felt much roomier and welcoming than it ever did as B&J's (or any of the other random short-lived businesses that have been housed there).  Now I feel like I've been missing out! I had some cheesy potato wontons that were fried and yummy, and an awesome plate of shortribs with asparagus and killer mashed potatoes.  I meant to only eat half of it and save the rest for lunch, but I devoured the entire entree without ever seriously entertaining a to-go box.  The ribs were perfectly seasoned, tender, and flavorful.  I could eat that meal for dinner every night. And dessert!  I had a perfect flourless chocolate cake - always kind of a crapshoot in my book.  They're so often too dense, too dry, or just way too sweet.  Not the case here - it was delicious and its texture was perfect.  These guys have come a long way from microwaving souffles at the LDC. I can't personally speak to the beer as beer isn't my thing - but my dining companions really (*really*) enjoyed the Russian Imperial Stout - which (I could be wrong about this) might have a pretty high alcohol content!  Either way, they loved it. Great meal and great people.  Glad things are working out for them.

Enter the restaurant 8pm, food ordered 8:20 (buffalo wings, steak, 2 side salads) 9:00 one salad delivered, 9:45 still no sign of wait staff, get up and leave. Waste of time. Don't bother.
Generally a really fun place to go, although I've only eaten there once. I got a pasta and squash salad, pasta was over cooked and it seemed odd to me to serve summer squash in the middle of December (I assumed that it would be butternut or something similar). My husband really enjoyed what he had which was some sort of pub grub. MY humble suggestion for this place would be to stop bothering with being a full restaurant and just serve pub food type appetisers throughout the evening along with their already expansive beer selection. None of their home brews are really special, but I like going there to drink beers and goof off with friends.

I just moved away from Ithaca, and Bandwagon ranks in the top three things I miss (after my best friend and Wegmans). I love this place and miss it constantly; it will be among my first stops next time I visit. In the short few months since Bandwagon opened, I went probably over a dozen times in a number of contexts - big groups (10 people), small groups (3 people), multi-course meals, just drinks, with new friends, with old friends, with family... It became my go-to place any time I had an excuse to go anywhere. My favorite aspect of Bandwagon is their microbrews, and the fact that you can get a flight for like $8. I've yet to try one of their beers that I didn't like enough to finish, and I've had several that I LOVE and can't wait for them to bottle so I can take them home to Boston - raspberry jalapeno, strawberry cream ale, nearly every stout... Plus, if you're not an adventurous type, they have a decent selection of other beer on tap and in bottles, plus liquor. As far as food goes, truly everything I tried was fantastic. My favorites have included the beet salad (listing a salad as a favorite seems ridiculous, but it's true), the boneless Buffalo tenders, the potato & cheddar wantons, the burger, the fish & chips, the fettuccini with chicken & shrimp & bacon (which I asked for without the shrimp, which was no problem)... There seem to be lots of options for both omnivores and vegetarians (and probably vegans, though I haven't looked hard), plus they've seemed pretty accommodating. The service has been consistent and great. They keep the water full, notice when you've finished your beer, offer suggestions for food and drink. They seem very experienced and knowledgeable, but not in that pretentious way that some seasoned servers have. The only negatives are that the space is dark (it's in the basement, so that's kind of a given, but the lights are kept dim) and can be loud due to the stone flooring and walls. This isn't bad enough to detract a star, though. Overall - great food, great beer, great service. I can't wait to go back.

Love it!  If you are a beer-drinker, you will too. Get a flight of the in-house brews.  (They brew about 20 gallons at a time, of 5 beers, and when they run out, change it for a new recipe.) This place writes a new menu daily, as their pantry changes with seasonal availability from local farms. With them changing the menu so often, the chefs have to get very creative from time to time.  This results in occasionally, poorly constructed dishes. Ask the service staff, they'll tell you which dishes are really shining that day.

I really want to like this place. I've been there several times now, and I keep wanting it to impress me. There are a few dishes that have, like the fries and a pesto pasta. But there are lots of items, like the veggie burger and habanero pasta (not really spicy, despite the warnings!) that sound good in the menu descriptions but just fall flat in execution. Plus the house-brewed beer, which should be a proud focal point for a brewpub, is very hit or miss. I've had one or two Bandwagon beers that I've liked, but most are just bleh. It's a fun atmosphere for a casual dinner, but the prices are too high to appreciate it as a "dive." The menu is ever-changing and sounds great when you read it, but the culinary sophistication suggested by the menu is lacking in the actual food.

I had to waver a bit before choosing 4-stars for this review.  The pub is as others have described....all over the place.  One thing's for sure: you never know what's in store for you on your visit.  If you've got plenty of time and enjoy a bit of drama or chaos, you'll find the bi-polar nature of the place very much to your liking. On our most recent visit, we all were very pleased with the food.  The two burgers and one pasta my friends ordered were really good.  My pork tenderloin was fantastic...tender, perfectly spiced, with fresh and delicious sides of potato and vegetable.   Not so pleased with the service.  I don't know what the problem is, but it seems they never manage to find or keep employees who can deliver.  Sometimes frazzled, sometimes indifferent, but never excellent.   That's too bad as the cocktails, beers, and the upscale pub grub is good.  Stick to the burgers and meat entrees and you won't be disappointed.

Amazing beers, always changing. Try the flight and then find your favorite. The food is amazing, it is well prepared and always has something interesting. If you like spicy try the pasta. Or the chicken and waffles is always great. I've tried almost everything on the menu and it has always been delicious and it seems like they care about their food and menu. Go for the amazing beer, stay for the great food.

Good selection of beers updated daily, depending on what kegs they have on their 24 taps. I had the flight of the beers that they brew. The Raspberry Jalapeño  was pretty good. The taster is a good amount, not sure I would want a full pint. The food choices were interesting and a good mix. I had the roast duck with a cherry port sauce. The duck and the garlic potatoes were both excellent. It losses a star for being very loud, being in the basement, they badly need some sound absorbing wall or ceiling stuff. It was nearly impossible to hold a conversation across the table.

This lower level basement restaurant is the future of fabulous casual cuisine in I-town. My last week in Ithaca, December 2009, I went to Bandwagon three times the week after they opened, the Burgers and Fries are amazing. Great selection of bottled beers and whiskey and very interesting homemade brews fermenting in the kitchen. Go see for yourself, its just downtown, several paces from the corner of Cayuga and State.

Go for the drinks, not the food!   Bandwagon offers a really solid selection of beers, wine and liquor. And I appreciate that it has a more welcoming environment than Ale House for a 30s and 40s crowd.  The only problem is the food is pretty subpar. Out of the four times I've eaten there, I've been sick to my stomach twice.  My advice is to just stick to the fries!

We were excited to go here based on reviews but were disappointed.  The food and drinks were not good.  Beer was sub par and the food was ok.  Atmosphere is great.

Came here for restaurant week- got two entrees and a free dessert. Cant say anything about the beers, but I heard they're pretty good. The food was yummy, the portions a little small for the price, but still filling (stupid american portions). split the aloha burger and the gnocci- great flavor in both. Had room for dessert, which was also good.

After two visits, I have to say one of the better places in Ithaca. First time got the hangar steak which was delicious, and got the half-pound burger the second time which was very good, albeit slightly undercooked. Service is good, but the place is small, so ideal for groups of 5 or under. Definitely a place worth coming back to.

We went with a large group for 10p-1a happy hour on a Friday night and got what we wanted: beers for not a lot of money.  The raspberry jalapeno beer was an interesting novelty and the cellar atmosphere was fun but not too crowded.   Though we didn't try any food I will definitely be back.

The menu was not what I expected. The food was just so-so. I tried the pork belly over barley. I liked the Barley salad. The pork belly did not live up to my expectations. I tried the beer flight and really liked a few. I'll go back and give the menu another try.

I picked this place at random after strolling around looking for an interesting place to eat on a drizzly Friday evening.  This is an easy place to overlook.  The entrance is nondescript and down a set of basement stairs. The space is attractively decorated and doesn't feel like a basement.  Although it was 6:30 on a Friday, I was able to get a table right away. The restaurant offers a new menu every day.  I asked about this and the waitress said that there were a handful of things that appeared every day but that they rotated a selection of other items and variations on a theme. I ordered one of the 4 beer flights offered.  The New York flight included nice sized pours of 5 local beers for $8.  I thought this was a fair value. As a main course, I selected the braised pot roast with leek and shallot gravy and roasted garlic mashed potatoes ($17).  It came quickly and was served with carrots.  The pot roast was more shredded than I would have liked rather than sliced but was delicious and the gravy was nicely balanced. I ordered the rum nut raisin bread pudding with praline sauce and whipped cream ($5).  This was an excellent choice.  The dessert was lighter than the usual bread pudding and had a nice, but not overpowering, amount of nuts.  It was also a good dessert to have with the last beer that was left from the flight. I really enjoyed my meal. They take the usual selection of plastic.

Awesome place! Had LUNCH on Friday and it was superb. Food Menu is updated as well as Beer Menu - the new Gorges Ale was a perfect compliment to the Beef tongue - Cooked just right and loaded with flavor! The brewer won an award for NYS best craft beer... Will definitely head back for a Friday lunch on business or with friends. They are open for lunch Saturday and Sunday at Noon - Who knew?

Overall, Bandwagon Brew Pub is a disappointment and tries to be extraordinary without doing the basics well. I was very excited that a brew pub opened in Ithaca. Its the only style of restaurant I felt was missing from the local dining scene. I made it there for dinner on 12-Jan-10. I sampled all the beers they brewed and I was thoroughly disappointed. The raspberry jalapeno has an overwhelming smell of peppers in the nose but the body is lean with little taste of raspberry. It finishes quite acidic and unpleasant. The color is light caramel and the head dissipates quickly. The black pepper porter has very subtle hints of black pepper in the nose but is missing from the watery body. The chocolate cherry porter has a calm nose and acidic aftertaste. There is no real taste of chocolate or cherry to speak of. The mouthfeel is awkwardly thin and unsatisfying. A lingering taste of soap and metal permeates the tongue during contemplation. The Russian Imperial stout is as much an Imperial Stout as I am a body builder. I have never had an imperial stout this flat in every dimension. The body was thin as the thinnest stout I had. The flavor was had no other flavor than roasted malt. A real imperial stout has insane amounts of complexity in the flavor that ranges from coffee to toffee to caramel to brulee to vanilla and has a very creamy texture. This one totally misses that essence and should be called a stout at best. If you did a blind taste with the Russian Imperial Stout and Black Pepper stout, you might not tell the difference, which is a shame. It was as authentic a Russian Imperial Stout as a Rolex on Canal St. The only beer I might try again would be the strawberry cream ale. It had a good sweetness in the body that came on early and late and became subdued in the middle. the body was like a rusty, dark colored hefeweizen that was opaque. I would like to see this in the context of a lighter beer like a filtered wheat or pilsner style. It would be a refreshing summer time beer like the strawberry wheat from Lancaster Brewing Company used to make. The consistent trend I noticed with the beers is that they were all heavily roasted or cloudy beers. I feel this hides imperfections in the brewing process that cannot be hidden in an IPA or other less opaque beers. The point is, I feel they tried to be too complex without mastering the basic points of each style. I see this all the time in the food and beverage business. I think if they tried to refine their recipes to be a simple porter, stout etc, they might make a tastier beer than trying to make something that should be reserved for more advanced brewers. Thankfully they have other beer on draft and bottles. The prices are somewhat reasonable so I was happy to try a really good Southern Tier Java on draft. Southern Tier makes some fantastic beer and I was more than happy to be reminded of it while I was at Bandwagon. The food was average. I had the focaccia and grilled pork tenderloin. The focaccia was airy and crispy but undercooked in the area underneath the tomato and cheese. This happens a lot when making thick crusted breads. I think its best to precook the bread for a few minutes before adding the toppings on thick crusted breads. to avoid undercooked regions. The two pieces I got were cut at inconsistent angles. I know this is a subtle issue that doesn't affect flavor but it shouldn't be too hard to cut consistent slices of focaccia. I see it as a sign of inexperience. I thought it was tasty and edible but it could have been much better. I expected a lot from the pork tenderloin because it took about 45 minutes to prepare. When the plate finally came, it looked like cafeteria food and wasn't much better. The tenderloin was unevenly cooked and the tip end was a noticeably drier than the rest of the portion. The tenderloin was completely unseasoned and bland. There is no excuse for not adding salt and pepper! The sauce was a bit heavy on the mustard but helped with the flavor of the tenderloin. Tenderloin typically cooks quickly when grilled. It should not take 45 minutes to grill a tenderloin. Any time longer dries out this cut. The mashed sweet potatoes would have been better if it weren't for the large chunks of undercooked potato. The poblano pepper and corn side dish was really good though. I could have eaten a full serving of it, and, in retrospect, I wish I would have. The servers were really nice and friendly. I spoke to three of them and they all made me feel welcome and appreciated. The one male server and I discussed beer for about 10 minutes. They are an asset. The interior reminded me of basement bars in old buildings that I used to visit in Lancaster, PA. The exposed rock walls helped with this atmosphere. I appreciate the copper bar because its hard and expensive to work with in terms of a service area. I hope Bandwagon works on these problems in the near future to make me a fan.
Overall, Bandwagon Brew Pub is a disappointment and tries to be extraordinary without doing the basics well. I was very excited that a brew pub opened in Ithaca. Its the only style of restaurant I felt was missing from the local dining scene. I made it there for dinner on 12-Jan-10. I sampled all the beers they brewed and I was thoroughly disappointed. The raspberry jalapeno has an overwhelming smell of peppers in the nose but the body is lean with little taste of raspberry. It finishes quite acidic and unpleasant. The color is light caramel and the head dissipates quickly. The black pepper porter has very subtle hints of black pepper in the nose but is missing from the watery body. The chocolate cherry porter has a calm nose and acidic aftertaste. There is no real taste of chocolate or cherry to speak of. The mouthfeel is awkwardly thin and unsatisfying. A lingering taste of soap and metal permeates the tongue during contemplation. The Russian Imperial stout is as much an Imperial Stout as I am a body builder. I have never had an imperial stout this flat in every dimension. The body was thin as the thinnest stout I had. The flavor was had no other flavor than roasted malt. A real imperial stout has insane amounts of complexity in the flavor that ranges from coffee to toffee to caramel to brulee to vanilla and has a very creamy texture. This one totally misses that essence and should be called a stout at best. If you did a blind taste with the Russian Imperial Stout and Black Pepper stout, you might not tell the difference, which is a shame. It was as authentic a Russian Imperial Stout as a Rolex on Canal St. The only beer I might try again would be the strawberry cream ale. It had a good sweetness in the body that came on early and late and became subdued in the middle. the body was like a rusty, dark colored hefeweizen that was opaque. I would like to see this in the context of a lighter beer like a filtered wheat or pilsner style. It would be a refreshing summer time beer like the strawberry wheat from Lancaster Brewing Company used to make. The consistent trend I noticed with the beers is that they were all heavily roasted or cloudy beers. I feel this hides imperfections in the brewing process that cannot be hidden in an IPA or other less opaque beers. The point is, I feel they tried to be too complex without mastering the basic points of each style. I see this all the time in the food and beverage business. I think if they tried to refine their recipes to be a simple porter, stout etc, they might make a tastier beer than trying to make something that should be reserved for more advanced brewers. Thankfully they have other beer on draft and bottles. The prices are somewhat reasonable so I was happy to try a really good Southern Tier Java on draft. Southern Tier makes some fantastic beer and I was more than happy to be reminded of it while I was at Bandwagon. The food was average. I had the focaccia and grilled pork tenderloin. The focaccia was airy and crispy but undercooked in the area underneath the tomato and cheese. This happens a lot when making thick crusted breads.

Bandwagon has a good menu and beer list, but I've seen a lot of inconsistency after going there for a year or so. Consistently good menu items include: fries and the accompanying sauces, the waffles with andouille, and the potato and cheddar wontons. I've had both good and mediocre iterations of most of the other dishes. The same goes for beer: the peanut butter chocolate stout was phenomenal, but I've also been served a glass of the jalapeno beer that tasted more like herbal tea - it was flat, and also tasted a bit watery.

The service was terrible. The rotini with habanero, bananas, and pineapples had enough spice but a terribly slimy texture. If you want to cut bananas into your pasta dish, it shouldn't cost $13.

My husband and I went here tonight for a special date night. I had the Chipotle Chicken sandwich. Very spicy in the perfect way, and lots of flavor not just spicy. Their hand cut fries and house made ketchup were delicious! Paired perfectly with their nice cold light "traditional" craft brew. The artichoke dip with crostini appetizer was delicious too, as was My husbands Vanilla Porter Burger with a side of mac and cheese and Rum Raisin Bread Pudding dessert. The ambiance and Decor is fun and the clientele mostly college students, but it wasn't rowdy and pretty classy.  Their yelp profile calls the ambiance "hipster" (whatever that means really) but the staff and our server were sweet and helpful the whole time. :) it's in a basement so you go down a flight of steps at the entrance, low light and cozy, but it's not cramped and tight. Reminds me of the bohemian, out of the way informal downstairs cafés and bistros in Paris.

Went with friends for a late-night dinner to this small hole-in-the-ground place. The food was good, and the servers were friendly. Their vegan burger was very good, and had a lot of flavor. If you ever want a burger and a drink in the commons late at night come here.

Bandwagon has a unique flavor that I haven't seen elsewhere.  Whoever runs the place is crazy.  As consequence, the menu is never the same, the beer all over the place, and you will never have the same experience twice.  In a small town, I love going here repeatedly just for that. That being said, I'd definitely say about 60% of the experiments are incredible.  For the lady's tastes in beer they have a roving selection of cheery, raspberry, and chocolate beers.  For the more traditional, they have a selection of hoppy to scottish to wheat beers.  They have a particular kind of lighter taste to their beers that put me off for a little bit (I'm partial to stouts).  But, I have found that it works very well with most of their experiments.  In a flight of their on tap beer, you'll find 2 that are okay, 1 that you hate and trade to someone else, and 2 that you love and could never have imagined existed. Oh, and when they say spicy - they mean spice that will prevent you from finishing the dish until the morning after.  Which, of course you will do as soon as you can, because it is that good. (pineapple pasta) Ah, and for the non-beer people, their mixed drinks, while pricey, are very good. The food can be described in much the same way.
