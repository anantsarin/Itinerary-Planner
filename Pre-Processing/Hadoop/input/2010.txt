I go here because I love the choices of movies the theater offers.  They aren't your summer blockbusters like Transformers but artsy movies not offered any place else in Buffalo (The Grand Budapest Hotel, Enough Said and Chef).  I tend to go Tuesdays cause half off popcorn and drinks, it's really good deal!   Friendly staff, large screens, crappy parking and real butter on your popcorn!

I've been frequenting this theater for like 2 or 3 decades and I have to say, the quality of the sound system was never what you could call "high fidelity" but that fact was never made as clear to me as tonight when I went in there to see "Gone Girl." Prior to the screening, the projectionist came into the lobby to warn us about the sound mix of the film and that it was hard to hear the dialog sometimes because the "ambient music" was too loud. I nearly walked out a few times to ask for my money back because I could understand maybe 1/2 of the dialog. In fact, I seem to recall the last film I saw there, I also had trouble hearing dialog and was on the verge of getting up to tell the projectionist the shit wasn't loud enough - and I have really sensitive hearing. Otherwise, they have fresh popcorn, the seating is regular old theater style, and they tend to get mostly older folks in there who I'm sure just crank their hearing aids to compensate for the weak sound system. As much as I hate many big commercial theaters, I will have to in the future venture out to the chain cinemas because if I'm paying the same prices ($9.50 plus $7 for popcorn - WTF), I need to hear dialog. Oh well.

The Amherst Theater on Main Street, operated by Dipson Theaters is pretty much everything a movie theater should be. To be clear... It is not McDonald's; it does not serve hot dogs, hamburgers, cheese-swamped pretzel bites, cheese-swamped nachos.  It is not Disneyland; it does not have fountains, streamers, banners, or characters.  It is not an arcade.  It is not a stadium.  It is not Ripley's Believe It or Not.  It does not have stadium seating, 3D thingamajigs, or any of the other unnecessary frills Mr. Regal and Mrs. AMC have conditioned you to want.   To be clear, Amherst Theater is a damned good movie theater, which means... It shows movies, good movies, movies you won't find in megaplexes at malls with vast parking lots out in front.  It is staffed by polite, competent individuals with palpable personalities who give two damns about movies.  It is clean and tidy.  Its screens are in proper working condition to view beautiful art films. So what kind of movies will you watch here?  "Doubt."  "Michael."  "My Blueberry Nights."  "Brokeback Mountain."  "Fahrenheit 9/11."  "The Artist."  "Black Swan."  (At least, those are some of the movies that I saw there.) You'll find critical darlings.  You'll find Oscar bait.  You'll find movies other theaters are afraid, unwilling, or unable to show. Moreover, visit here enough and you'll quickly learn that the place is dedicated to the community, that it hosts college-affiliated screenings with lectures, special Midnight features, and local premieres.  You'll learn that you can lop $2 or more off an admission every Tuesday.  Moreover, you'll learn that even their regular priced tickets are a buck cheaper than that of Regal.   Note: this theater is owned by Dipson, which also operates North Park (on Hertel), Market Arcade (downtown), the McKinley Mall theater, and the Eastern Hills Mall theater.  Between them (all of which share a similar mantra and similar pricing), it is entirely possible to swear off Regal and AMC for good in the greater Buffalo area.  Do yourself a favor and give this place a shot.

After coming here a few more times, I have to give this small Theater huge props. It rocks! Why? - The staff is friendly and will chat you up (if there's no line). - They play movies that you won't find in other Theaters (it was one of the only Theaters to show the limited released Shame around B'flo) - It's independently owned. - The Theater is always clean and although not all the seats have cup holders, that's part of the charm of this place. My only feedback would be to see if they can turn up the sound to some of the movies. Maybe I've shot my hearing from too many concerts lately, but it seemed like the volume of the movie was a little low. Nevertheless, if you're looking for a nice independent Theater -- check this or North Park out!

Charming locally and family owned business. The popcorn has real butter, of you like that kind of thing. They also self chocolate dipped chocolate chip cookies. The staff are very friendly and this three screen theatre has a lot of old times charm. With the North Park closed, this is my favorite theatre in town. Super high ceilings, velvet seats...it's quite the experience. Tickets are $7 on Tuesdays and popcorn and pop are half price. Student discounts and matinee pricing also available. You'll see movies here you might not see anywhere else around Buffalo.

ok do not go here! ugh, this is why the Southtowns rule. expensive as hell no snacks flat pop dirty ass small crappy screen it literally had 2 large splashes of what looked like someone threw pop or something at it and they didnt wipe it off and it was right in the middle of the screen on everyones faces that were in the movie, old seats, one of my arm rests was missing and it was sharp metal! this place is a joke. oh and the parking's odd too.   will never be desperate enough to drive there to see a movie again!

Nice little neighborhood theater. It could have been a little cleaner.

When I first came to the Dipson a few years ago it was to see a somewhat arty film, so I liked this place already. I can count on the Dipson to have a couple different movies screening and one is usually something I can't find at a movie megaplex. The staff is always friendly and has given me a student discount even when I couldn't produce my ID card. Their concession is just about as expensive as other theaters ($$$$) but I feel better spending my money here. It isn't quite as charming as its North Park cousin, but there is a wider variety of showtimes and films here.

Great old style theater.  Shows good movies too.  A little cold sometimes.

Kicking it old school, Amherst 3 is how I like theaters.  They play the good hard to find Indie movies, they are cheap (and offer student discounts) and their concessions are good (Snapple, coffee, and taza tea!).  There's no stadium seating and the seats are a little beat but it adds to the charm and since it's not in the mall or some tween hang-out you can watch a movie in peace and quiet.  The best part.

Excellent art theatre - clean, well kept, digital projection, good sound, good movie selection. Only complaint is a slight smudge on screen #3, otherwise great venue with excellent prices (especially Tuesday nights)!
