I came in one night after eating dinner nearby and spent about an hour here. Noel talked about his art but also left me alone to enjoy the various artwork displayed on the walls. I signed up for a workshop and thoroughly enjoyed it! It cost only $30 total for my friend and I to get a 90-minute art lesson. I really do plan on signing up to take some of his classes. The cost comes to $25 a session, which is peanuts. I just have to save up because I recently got a big pay cut.
Walked by this place after getting some bagels next door....I briefly glanced thru the window and kept going, but after a few steps I turned back. What peaked my interest was the sleek, clean white space with the colorful and intricate art on the walls.....At first I thought it was some organic, crunchy granola, 'save the earth' kind of place and was VERY pleasantly surprised by this gallery's concept of creating art with the IPad and artwork. Owner Noel was really friendly, informative, pleasant and very welcoming. We shared some talk about his ideas and I HIGHLY recommend anyone and everyone to check out thegrassynoel....it's a great place for artists, teckies and art lovers alike!
This gallery space has a great vibe (not pretentious like some "typical" galleries.) It's inviting and comfortable. It's neat (and I don't just mean tidy.)  There's something very  cool about the combination of tech and art that's happening here. Definitely a place to revisit regularly.
