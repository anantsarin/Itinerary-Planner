Most years I like taking an annual trip to Holiday Valley.  This place is fantastic.  Almost all of their slopes were groomed to perfection when we were there.  The lift attendants do a great job of managing lift lines and get people up the hills quickly.  They have 3 high speed lifts here.    They have 3 separate lodges and each one is fantastic.  The one lodge is intended for families and has plugs for crock pots and food storage during the day.  How cool is that?!    I wish they were closer to Pittsburgh!  The runs are long and wide for east coast skiing.  We have lots of fun on their slopes.  Cant wait to go back.  The town of Ellicottville also adds to the fun of coming here.

When your in-laws spend their days on the slopes and evenings cooking gourmet meals, you've married into the right family. When your in-laws buy a ski in/ski out condo, you've struck gold! This is our home mountain (on the east coast). There's no surprise that HV made the top 50 ski resorts in N.America list. There are a load of runs for skiers and snowboarders of all levels. A lot of terrain to explore here and quite a few lodges as well. Really family friendly. The staff and ski patrol are good people. Kudos to artistic hand of the lifties who etched the full size snow couch and snow sculptures! We enrolled my 3 y.o in the Burton Riglet lesson. Best investment! Watching the little man get his snowlegs and conquer the little park was the highlight of the trip. He'll be on the bunny slopes next season, no doubt. He watches pro snowboarders and says "Hey, just like me!" Little dude's got the right attitude! They offer a great military discount. Any mountain where you chill around a bonfire in the trees, tossing back a couple of beers is a 5 star in my book!

Always a good time. Slopes are long for an east coast resort. They can get icy if you go on a bad day so be careful. Just check the snow report. They have some fun runs and even some cool wooded runs. Fun to do a few times. There parks are only ok. For as big as they are, they always have average parks. Step parks or too basic ones. They don't have a good mix. Renovated and clean interior. Decent food and a great bar with lots of the local brews. A must a resort. The bars are nice but there is no energy. It's just a normal bar. Nothing fun. all in all great eastern resort.

Three words describe Holiday Valley: LAKE EFFECT HEAVEN. I'm a former ski racer, and I'm very picky about my terrain. Holiday Valley definitely ranks up there as one of the best ski resorts in the east. While it only has about 700 vertical feet, it has a good range of terrain. You can buy a 4- or 8-hour lift ticket and ski from 8:30 in the morning to 10:30 at night if you want. For aggressive skiers, I suggest the 4-hour, and don't take a break, as the mountain can get boring because it's pretty small. For beginner and intermediate, I suggest 8-hour. You can see the whole mountain, and take breaks. The lodges on the mountains are quite nice--very much like those that you see at the Money Mountains (Beaver Creek, Vail, Deer Valley) that you get out west (btw, I ski at all these places . . . they have their appeal). As a former member of the Killington Ski Club/Kilington Mountain School team, I'm pretty biased as to my opinion of Eastern ski resorts. Okay, so there's not a ton of terrain . . . but the QUALITY OF THE SNOW IS FANTASTIC. Unlike most eastern ski resorts, there is very little snowmaking, as Holiday Valley/Elicottville falls at the heart of the Lake Erie snow belt. I left my equipment at home since I was only skiing for a day, so I rented from the demo shop. I have to say, they were not very knowledgeable, and tried to give an ex-racer a women's ski (which are WAYYYYY soft) Though that shouldn't matter for most people. They did listen to me when I protested, and their prices were very reasonable. The village of Elicottville is also quite charming, and I would definitely suggest spending a weekend here if you're from Western NY or Southern Ontario.

Being from central ohio, we don't get anywhere near the amount of vertical elevation or snow that upstate NY gets, Therefore we have to really plan on where we want to go to ski. Considering the distance, I would say Holiday Valley is in the top three resorts within six hours drive of Columbus. The other being peak and peek and the third being seven springs. We took advantage of the early season package, as well as the unseasonal large amount of snow that fell on the area (60" by thanksgiving day) to have a weekend of skiing. Although the skiing was good sometimes, there was definitely a lot of ice and crud (have the scrapes on my skis to prove it) throughout the resort, and about 1/3 of the runs were still closed when we were there. The lifts are fast and they get you to the top of the long runs fast. It was never overly crowded when we were skiing, but that was during the morning and early afternoon (except late friday night, when it was blizzarding so a lot of people stayed in anyways). As is the case with all ski resorts, lift tix are overpriced, food is outrageous, don't even bother stepping into the ski shops ($$$$$$$) and there is a distinct lack of close parking and changing areas. Last tip for Ohio skiers, if you're skiing at ANY Ohio resort and haven't been to one in NY, make sure to start on the green runs first, if you think you're black diamond from going down those at mad river, BMBW, snow trails, etc... you've got nothing on the runs here.

I went snowboarding for the first time and I honestly had no idea what to expect. All I know is that I had a great time and all the workers and instructors were super nice. The workers were so ridiculously nice helping us registering for class and renting our equipment. Hey, $56 for lessons, 8 hour lift ticket and rentals is good for my wallet! They also came over to give us snack bars when we came in for a rest. Then the instructors went above and beyond to try to teach us the basics of surviving the slopes. I had a couple bad falls, but they were continuously helpful and encouraging. They also did an extra run with our group even though they ran over time. I have no idea about the slope conditions or whether they were good or not, but I definitely had fun there! Oh and an hour from Buffalo = awesome!

At 750ft. vertical rise, Holiday Valley is on the short side for a ski area.  What it lacks in height (though it is taller everything nearby except for Bristol Mountain), Holiday Valley makes up for in snow coverage and quality, terrain variety, lift capacity and speed, availability of lodging, reasonably priced food, convenient parking and overall good management.  Another welcome recent development is the relaxation of the tree-skiing policy. Anthropomorphization time.  I hope that you consider Holiday Valley to be a woman and not a man.  A short woman who is otherwise attractive, intelligent and interesting will likely be seen as vivacious and passionate.  A similarly situated man will be seen as an angry midget with a Napoleon complex, his virtues overlooked and denigrated as mere compensations for his lack of height. A ski area is much more than its height.  Therefore, I urge you to look past Holiday Valley's relatively short stature and extol its virtues, which may seemingly be only done if you view Holiday Valley not as a man, but as a woman.

Spending New Years at Holiday Valley was a really great experience. Minus their lame party, being on the slopes in rainy weather was still really fun! After being on these hills, Boston Mills/Brandywine is super lame. I will totally make the trip to Ellicotville again! Staying at their new Tamarack club was super nice too, but also super pricey. One night is roughly $200-$300. I would do a cheap motel then spend the extra money on an all day lift ticket or something. But the hills are beautiful and that's really all that matters :)

Fun in the sun! Great Easter weekend skiing! Nice variety of slopes. Nice lift capacity and high speed chairs. Good food that is reasonably priced.

First time I've gone skiing out East and HV had its ups and downs. Pros: -CHEAP ($28 for night lift ticket from 4-10 at participating Wegman's + $22 for ski rentals).  I've done most of my skiing at Lake Tahoe in CA and prices there have gotten so out of hand that I would pay ~$100 for the lift + rental combo. -Good staff.  I got all lift ticket + rentals taken care of in a matter of minutes.  And although it was a little annoying that towards the peak hours, they checked proof of lift ticket but at least they're doing their job. Cons: -Runs were really short and difficulty ratings were inconsistent.  I found some blues to be every bit as difficult as some blacks and as a whole, the runs were less challenging than ones elsewhere.  Maybe it's just b/c it's a shorter mountain that what I'm used to. -Lots of kids there.  I don't know if this is just a one-time thing but there were literally hundreds of high-schoolers there that night and maybe it was their ski trip but if it's like that all the time, it gets to be pretty obnoxious.

It's not Utah or Colorado, or even Vermont for that matter.  BUT it's the best same-day 'riding around.   Yes, it does get icy especially when the season winds down. Get up first thing Saturday or Sunday morning, load up the truck and hit the 219.  50 minutes later, I'm strapped on and waiting to take my first run of the day.  At the end of a long "work out" on the slopes, I can be home in time for dinner (if I haven't been overserved at the bar).   Varied terrain, lots of easy green for the beginner skiier, semi-challenging blues for the beginner rider (cuz we don't need no stinkin' greens) and a good variety of black runs, when Eagle Chair is open.  The Eagle lift never has a lift line.  Always ask your chairmates where they're from--I can't believe how far people drive to hit up our little gem of WNY.

Nice little ski hill in the heart of the Southern Tier.  They have a few decent sized runs and the lifts are fast and convenient.  Only thing I think is an issue is the grooming.  they groom very little and that can be good when the snow is light and airy, but that heavy lake effect stuff just piles up and packs down to hard slush.  It's east coast ,so it get's icy in a lot of places too.  they should really take care to make sure their runs are better kept.  it has the potential to be great. lots of really nice backwoods pathsand cut-thrus for the adventurous, and some good trails for the beginner or casual skier.

This is probably one of the best local mountains that I've been to. Holiday has trails for everybody, ranging from kids and beginners to more advanced riders. Each trail takes on its own personality, having different shapes, turns, bumps, etc. So the scenary is always changing, which is good because things dont get boring. Its also very easy to get around on the top of the mountain, with tons of lifts and paths that cut and merge into other trails. Its a great riding mountain and they do have a terrain park but I believe Kissingbridge's park is the better of the two. But if you're talking about the mountain itself and the trails, then Holiday is definitely the better for riding. But overall I think Holiday is the nicer and more quality mountain vs Kissingbridge. Snow quality here is usually pretty on point. Everything is nicely maintained. Overall it just looks and feels beautiful when your out on a nice winter evening (I usually went during the night because of price and less people). Its a great mountain in my opinion, and if I ever go back to Buffalo to snowboard then Holiday Valley it is.

A very solid east coast ski resort.  The vertical is pretty minimal by destination ski resort standards (even for the east coast), but it easily makes up for it with a bevy of lengthy runs.  The terrain is pretty varied, but really centers on blues and greens, there aren't really many runs that are truly blacks, and if you're looking for significant challenge, this probably isn't the resort to go to (go to Whiteface or Jay Peak).  I will say the staff are always helpful and there are always plenty around to help you find your way around the mountain.  It's large enough so that it's not crazy crowded all the time either.  Grooming is generally good, like any east coast mountain, ice is always a concern.  I don't know much about the lessons or condos, but they both look very solid.  Terrain parks are decent, nothing spectacular, but decent.  One of the better features is the price, only $63 for an 8-hour lift ticket on the weekends, which is a killer deal compared to a lot of "big" ski resorts.

Great slopes. They were nice and long. I would be back.

Best skiing within 3 hours of Cleveland.  I have been lucky enough to travel to HV for the last 17 years of my life.  I can honestly say each year they put money back into the mountain.  They have new runs, lifts, lodges, or adventure areas.  People need to realize that it is out east skiing.  It isn't Aspen.  If you are looking for a quick getaway with a nightlife, then EVL is the place.  Do not get sucked in by the signs for Peek N Peak.  The place is half the size and sucks.  There are also no bars or nightlife to speak of.

Thank you to the courteous staff at the Tamarack Lodge.  We spent Fall Festival weekend in Ellicottville and the accommodations were clean and comfortable and the staff very accommodating.  We are not skiers but since the Holiday Valley Resort area has reinvented themselves for spring and summer activities we have been here often.  The golf, pools and nearby shopping have made EVL a must go destination.

just got back from my 4th visit to HV and it keeps getting better! I'm a lot closer to 7-Springs and I told them if HV were a bit closer they'd lose a LOT of business!! My 11-year old even said...'forget 7-Springs Dad, we'll come here from now on'!! They continue to put their $ where it matters, back into the resort! Just a fantastic mix of runs and many high speed lifts (some with rests, my knees thank you!)...and it's less expensive than my regular place...for two, 2-day passes and a 2-day snowboard/boot/helmet rental for the boy it was $260...can't beat it! Not sure what's up with all the panty trees but oh well...my son looked at me like...uh, what's up with that?!! And little things like a waffle hut near one of the lifts...OMG that smell on a cold day had me ready to run people over!!! Not sure why or who on the ski patrol got a bad rap from some reviewers but we've never had an issue with them...We will definitely return!

Great family ski resort close to Cleveland.  Great lodging, ski runs, ski school.  Nice town with dinner options.  Kids love the indoor outdoor pool and hot tubs.

We go on a ski trip evey year with our friends and in 2009 we went to Holiday Valley. We stayed at Valley Village in a very interesting condo. The decor was very strange( very orange and in most of the pictures there were these little dolls)  but the condo was very modern, up to date. We had a hot tub on the back porch and one night we even went sledding out back. At the time I was not a good skiier at all but I really enjoyed all of the green runs and some of the blues. I loved our location on the slopes. It was great for everyone in our group.

Very nice, clean place with a great patio view. Great quality bath soaps and friendly staff.

Since I'm the darn Duchess I guess I should review. Holiday Valley ROCKS. And it's so good to rock. Great, really.  For skiing it's the best place in the East.  The only thing keeping it from being one of the best in the country is a relatively low elevation. And not much you can do about that now, is there? So they make up for it in many other ways.  New lodge is PHENOMENAL.  Love it. Great bar and food area, big stone fireplaces, lots of room. The trails are very well groomed and full of snow thanks in part to Mother Nature finally producing some real snow but also thanks to HV's stellar snow-making scheme.  The Tamarack Lodge has great amenities - spa, restaurant (John Harvards) and nice rooms.  The Yodeler Lodge is beautiful with a raging outdoor firepit to warm yer buns after a cold run down the ski trail bearing its name.  Tannenbaum Lodge is also nice, and a better place to park if you already have a ski pass (less crowded, good food, and nice fireplace).  There's a cafe in the new lodge that serves up the Starbucks that keeps me alive and kickin' and there's a cute little Euro style waffle shack near the base of the slopes that serves waffles and hot chocolate for kicks.  The lifts are all in grand condition and the skiing is excellent. People are generally pleasant on the slopes with the occasional rude pack of pre-pubescent snowboarders who think they rule the effin' world.  But other than those jacks, it's a nice crowd of locals, Canadians, and Ohioans with some random Pennsylvanians and other mid-Atlantickers finishing up the mix.  What else can I tell you, Dear Reader?  Come here to ski.  The town of Ellicottville is awesome too.  Don't waste your time at Kissing Bridge or Buffalo Ski Club Greek Peak or the other randoms in the area.  Holiday Valley is the place to ski in New York.

The trails are very well groomed and full of snow thanks in part to Mother Nature finally producing some real snow but also thanks to HV's stellar snow-making scheme.  The Tamarack Lodge has great amenities - spa, restaurant (John Harvards) and nice rooms.  The Yodeler Lodge is beautiful with a raging outdoor firepit to warm yer buns after a cold run down the ski trail bearing its name.  Tannenbaum Lodge is also nice, and a better place to park if you already have a ski pass (less crowded, good food, and nice fireplace).  There's a cafe in the new lodge that serves up the Starbucks that keeps me alive and kickin' and there's a cute little Euro style waffle shack near the base of the slopes that serves waffles and hot chocolate for kicks.  The lifts are all in grand condition and the skiing is excellent. People are generally pleasant on the slopes with the occasional rude pack of pre-pubescent snowboarders who think they rule the effin' world.  But other than those jacks, it's a nice crowd of locals, Canadians, and Ohioans with some random Pennsylvanians and other mid-Atlantickers finishing up the mix.  What else can I tell you, Dear Reader?  Come here to ski.  The town of Ellicottville is awesome too.  Don't waste your time at Kissing Bridge or Buffalo Ski Club Greek Peak or the other randoms in the area.  Holiday Valley is the place to ski in New York.
We had our wedding and reception at Holiday Valley in June.  They did an incredible job!  We had many friends and family that stayed the weekend with us.  Everyone had amazing things to say about Holiday Valley!  The staff was friendly and accommodating!  Shirley and Nikki planned the wedding of our dreams.  We did not have to worry about anything.  The venue was gorgeous, our accommodations were fantastic, the food was out of this world, and we did not have to worry about anything!  We stayed and played at the Ski High Adventure Park after the wedding! It was a fantastic vacation for all involved!  I can't thank Holiday Valley enough, especially Shirley Roblee for everything she did for us!  We will be back every summer to spend our anniversary there!  I would highly recommend Holiday Valley to any bride!!
