I have been a regular at the Argos since they opened, and held a private event there a month ago. There are ups and downs. THE GOOD: The building is immaculate and beautiful. The period style and feel and the decor were what drew us to Argos to begin with, and encouraged us to drop thousands on an event there. Once you arrive, the drinks and bartenders are excellent, if a bit expensive. If nothing else, the Argos is a great place to have a drink. We also rented out several of the hotel rooms for the night of our event, and they are wonderfully comfortable and modern. Our event itself went off very well, exactly as planned, and to our private bartender's credit, she wisely started making one of our guests' gin-and-tonics out of just tonic when it became clear she had already had a few too many. THE BAD: Our event was handled properly, but I feel that may have been by accident. In the month or so prior the the event, I was handed off from one event coordinator to another repeatedly, and none of the three coordinators could ever be reached on the telephone, and were only sometimes responsive by e-mail. Apparently my event of only 30 guests was insufficient to rate the highest quality of service, as from one member of staff to the next, they always seemed to be too busy handling someone else's event to have time to discuss mine with me. Not that my event was terribly complex, I am sure, but I would have liked to talk to someone in person at some point. The one hitch in the plan was that although I understood that the bar service was to be for three hours, I did not expect that at the end of those three hours, the staff would un-reserve the *banquet room* and allow the public into our party, which was still happening even after our bar service had ended. I feel that if we had been able to actually discuss the parameters of the event before it had occurred, this would have been talked about and avoided. That our event space was un-reserved out from under us was disappointing, but I guess the party was winding down anyway. The rooms are indeed loud, but this didn't bother us, as we were part of the crowd that night anyway. Argos is a hopping place; don't expect a quiet Bed & Breakfast here. There is no kitchen, so expect nothing hot to eat in the morning. The cold breakfast items ranged from meh to reasonably good: enough to get you started in the morning at least. On the basis of all the above, I would rate the Argos 4 stars and would be happy to remain their customer and would probably reserve them for a party again, being a little more careful to make sure to have a personal face-to-face meeting with someone to ensure that all the details were in fact handled expertly, as the website claims their speciality to be. THE UGLY: A couple of weeks after this event, having drinks with a group of about 6-7 friends at the same banquet table we had recently catered for 30, our conversation was rudely interrupted by staff and I was asked to leave for bringing in a slice of pizza. To a bar that has a banquet table but no kitchen. Bring in food for 30 and you are welcomed with indifferently open arms; bring in a slice for one and you will be ejected. This very unwelcoming experience altered my perspective of everything that had gone on before, and brought the indifferent treatment prior to the party to the forefront of my mind rather than the party itself, and these, I now think, are Argos's true colors. I won't be returning now. Yes, the Argos is beautiful, but only on the outside. Beauty fades. Pomposity is forever.
The Argos Inn is magic. I've stayed overnight several times, and love to come to the bar for book club or a drink or some music. I've stayed in four different rooms. In each one, the beds are like clouds, soft spotlessly clean high quality sheets and so comfortable. I like the modernity of the rooms and the bathrooms in contrast to the historic preservation of the hotel itself. Its so nice to have the bar downstairs, it feels like going back in time and this is your mansion and you are having a house party. There is often wonderful music. The owner said he's responded to a few guest's noise complaints by closing the bar at 10pm now, though the noise has never bothered me. I always leave this place feeling refreshed, and a little revived and more myself.
Very cute little inn in downtown Ithaca. The cocktails here are very delicious, and quite strong! The inn is extremely beautiful, decorated in an industrial modern style. Very cute date place. Parking is limited, especially during special events. We had to find side street parking in one of the residential suites.
This is one of the fancier bars in the Ithaca area. I did not like the fact that there were flies flying around. They have an interesting menu of cocktails and the bartenders are very skilled. I would say they didn't have much fruity cocktails, so I did not really like mine. I also had absinthe, they have the actual absinthe tap. There are also hotel rooms upstairs.
I have stayed in several hotel/inns in Ithaca; there is nothing like this in the area (possibly even the state). A mansion that had humble beginnings as a revolutionary war cabin (!) the restoration is stunning. Handcrafted detail in every corner, the Argos Inn opened just this year. Because of the transition of the bar, I would have given it 4 stars, but I have confidence that Argos is making noise complaints a top priority. I spoke with the owner about his plans to address reviews on here regarding noise. He was aware and is working with his staff to make changes addressing the issue. I had no complains about noise during my stay. The Inn is beautiful and the rooms are exquisite. I am looking forward to staying here again.

It is 11pm. I'm laying in my room wishing that I'd had the foresight to bring ear plugs. The argos Inn is beautifully renovated, the staff are friendly and helpful, and the bartenders are excellent. However, if you care to actually sleep at the Inn, avoid it at all costs for Friday and Saturday nights. Back to the present. As I lay here (in my room I might add, with the door closed and a white noise machine running) with thudding music whatevertheoppositeofwaftingis pouring up through the floor and the rather loud buzz of bar conversations bleeding into my room, punctuated by the occasional clink of glasses, I am reminded of the fact that I have to be pretty pissed off or ecstatically pleased by something to bother writing a review. Guess which one I am right now? If you plan on staying up until after midnight and want someplace that has a very lively bar, than argos may well be for you. If you're just coming for a drink, then the bar is excellent. If, on the other hand, you paid a premium for someplace nice to sleep, you will be displeased should you have the misfortune of staying here on a night when the bar is active.

Very cool bar and even cooler to stumble upon an awesome jazz trio i3° that plays here every Wednesday from 5-7. I plan to be a regular.

I love the cocktails here. You have to try the Bagpipe Mariachi! They really work to create them in an old-fashioned style. They follow the fundamentals which ensure a spectacular drink every time. The bartenders are friendly and knowledgeable. I love how they renovated the building. We came during the Opening. I love the rooms

I like this place for the artistic and stylish appeal ! The guy is a genious.. All the details..

The Argos is a hip place to have a drink but the rooms are very noisy. Forget about getting any rest when the bar is open. There is absolutely no sound proofing in the rooms.  Also coffee is supposed to be available at 8 but alas here I sit uncaffinated writing a bad review.

I don't know anything about cocktails, but this is a nice place to get a drink. I also am unaware of the 10 and 5 rule. If it means the staff won't give you a blow job, then yes they fail on this particular standard. Otherwise the staff are extremely friendly and very helpful with drink recommendations.

Honestly, I don't know what all these people who wrote bad reviews are talking about!  I had a wonderful experience at Bar Argos.  The atmosphere was cool, cozy, and felt like sitting in a friends living room.  I would love to see it in the daytime.  It was a very busy evening and when I made it to the bar, it was appropriately staffed and I was greeted quickly relative to the amount of customers that were there.  The menu was smaller, but it was well thought out and had an obvious theme of classic, "historic preservation" cocktails. It also looked like they had created some original cocktails, but all went along with the theme of the menu.  The bartender answered my questions and made recommendations, which was certainly appreciated on such a busy night.  My friend and I tried all of their Champagne cocktails, and they were delightful! We were fascinated by the Absinthe Fountain, which was also in keeping with the classic cocktail theme, but will have to try one of those cocktails next time...which there will definitely be! Bottom line: Beautiful atmosphere, friendly and helpful staff, excellent service, and fun cocktails.  Looking forward to our next visit!

The Argos Inn is a new hotel in Ithaca located on the main drag near the central business district.  It is an historic mansion restored to please modern travelers.  Unfortunately, what announces itself as a hotel is actually a busy, loud, bar scene with a few rooms where it is next to impossible to get a good night's sleep.  Between the traffic that roars by up and down the hill and the loud indoor outdoor bar, there isn't a quiet corner to be found.  Not worth the money.

I stayed at Argos Inn when I was visiting Ithaca for a wedding and I wish I could have stayed there longer. I loved everything about this place. The decor, the attention to every small detail and especially the wonderful customer service. The decor is a tasteful mix of vintage and modern. The bed was very comfortable. The service was friendly and attentive. And the breakfast spread was delicious. One of the things that really impressed me was getting an email after I had checked out to let me know that I had left a few things in the room and they offered to mail my belongings (for free!). I highly recommend Argos Inn for anyone looking for a place to stay in Ithaca.

Great place to stay in Ithaca! Beautiful rooms, great bar, wonderful events to meet lots of locals!

I worked an event held the Argos Inn yesterday. Of course, I had to research the joint in advance. I discovered that it was a newly restored historic mansion and that it had a bar with an amazing assortment of craft cocktails. Needless to say, I knew what I would be doing after the event. They had just changed over their seasonal drink menu, so one of the drinks I wanted to try was not listed. I was trying to sample drinks with different gins than what I have on the home bar (Hendrick's and Plymouth).  I found two beverages that did (Flora & Fauna and In Bloom) and my friend got a Hendrick's beverage (Wax Poetic), which was more "spirit-forward," as the bartender described. That one is on my list for the next time I go. The nice part about working the event is that we got to enjoy the decor during daylight hours AND also got to see several of the rooms. The ones that are completed are beautifully appointed with heated bathroom floors and decorative accents. Every detail (even the bookshelves in the bar, which are organized by color) is curated by the owner. It seems well-planned and designed and when complete, this is going to be a spectacular place to visit/ stay. The only reasons I'm giving it 4 stars as opposed to 5 are: 1) because I haven't stayed overnight there and 2) they're still working on a few of rooms so it's not complete. However, the bar and staff that I met are definitely worth 5 stars, hands down. It's definitely a great place to grab a drink if you're in the Ithaca area!
