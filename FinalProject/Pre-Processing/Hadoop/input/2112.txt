The Pub has been a Jamestown institution for quite a while. I have been told my first "visits" here were in utero, so I guess I have been a long-time fan!  Sadly, an electrical fire late in 2013 caused extensive damage and The Pub was completely destroyed. Kudos to the Lisciandro/McCusker family, and the support of Jamestown and government agencies, for bringing The Pub back. The inside looks like a wonderful modern update of the "old" Pub. With the dark woodwork, beautiful wrap around bar, sandwich station, and cozy booths, you can take a seat for a drink, or have your whole family meet up for a casual dinner. The menu features sandwiches, Italian favorites, pizza, burgers, salads, and other basic fare. The center of the bar is a little sandwich station where you can see your sandwich made up in front of you. I had a BLT while my mom had the eggplant parm sandwich. I had mine on a whole wheat pub roll which was soft, moist, and super tasty. I loved the fresh, ripe tomato and they gave me a squeeze bottle of mayo so I could add my own amount.. My mom said her eggplant was cooked perfectly and she liked the Italian white bread and the sauce was not too sweet. We both got a side a chips and our total w/ waters was under $15. We liked seeing different items, including vegetarian, of all types. About 8 beers on tap, including local Southern Tier, and many others in bottles. Large liquor selection. They don't overstock, so some popular menu items may run out. I look forward to some more trips to The Pub in the future! PS: There was a sign as we walked in that they are cash only right now. Not sure if that is going to change.

Can't wait for some Pub Pasta. This place is a local favorite and any visit to Jamestown would not be complete without a stop at the Pub. You come for the people, you stay for the food and drinks. Great food and great friends. Check out the Pub!

If you're into Styrofoam plates, plastic cutlery and microwaved food, then this is the place for you. It's probably best to go to the pub to get drunk and watch sports... don't take a date here for food. First of all, I like the atmosphere of the place.  It looks nice and feels very 'old school.' Other than that, this place is way under par.  Don't expect to be able to pay with a credit card.  This 'old school' establishment won't accept them.  Don't expect to find a working ATM in Jamestown either.   We ordered a rueben and a meatloaf sandwich. Both were literally microwaved behind the bar.  The meatloaf sandwich was two slices of pre-made meatloaf on bread.  Served with chips and a pickle.  Same for the rueben... ham and cheese on bread with chips and a pickle.  All microwaved, and served on Styrofoam plates.   Obviously, this place is a local favorite.  I don't get it... an $8 sandwich should at least be prepared from scratch and put on a plate.

The Pub in Jamestown, NY has the best bar food I've ever had in my life. Owned by 60s NFL legend Jim McCusker, with great recipes from his wife Mary, it's one of America's greatest watering holes, in my humble opinion. Western New York State is famous for their beef on weck sandwiches, and the Pub's can't be beat. I highly recommend getting anything with Mary's sweet pasta sauce on it, especially the eggplant parm sandwich.  Really, there's nothing there I wouldn't suggest.  I eat there whenever I'm in Jamestown and can. The owners' nephew Sam is one of the best bartenders on earth.

The Pub offers a sort of lounge atmosphere to it, conducive to good conversation and relaxing drinks at reasonable prices. In fact, it is a little more upscale than the average bars in the area generally catering to a more 30 something age group. The best food is the beef on weck, but it's all well done, sitting in its juices in a stainless container. It certainly isn't anything like the beef on weck you'll find in other places equipped with a carving station, but since there aren't any such places in Jamestown, this is about the best beef on weck you can find.

Decent bar. Decent food. The beef is ok, a little tough and dry but ok. Dipping it in a side of au jus helps. Beef and Barrel blows it out of the water though, The Pub doesn't even compare. Only one bartender working the large bar during our visit and the service was a bit sub-par. There are dual microwaves across from the bar that the bartender was constantly using to heat food before serving it. WTF? Soup was the best part of our meal. We had the spicy corn chowder which was nice. !!CASH ONLY!! There is an ATM located inside that was in good working order during our visit.

The best thing about The Pub, one of the staples here in Jamestown, is the eclectic atmosphere that can be found depending on the day and time you happen to pop in. The jukebox is amazing and (most of the time) the clientele and/or the bartenders do an excellent job of creating playlists for you listening pleasure. That being said, you have to learn The Pub's atmosphere. Do you want low key sport watching of your favorite college basketball team on a mellow weekday evening? That can happen. Do you want a good group of your 30-something friends having some libations and good laughs? This is possible. Do you want to be overrun by the younger generation begging for shots and playing Spice Girls? I have witnessed this... and then called it a night.

The Pub was a nice little bar in a pretty much empty town. The bartenders were friendly, and good servers, and the prices were great. Wasn't the best bar I've ever been too- but far from the worst.

How about a total step back in time to the golden era of postwar America? It feels like you walked back into 1949 or so. Sandwiches and a bar, no credit cards. Red naugahyde booths with Formica table tops, faux brick on the walls with smoky beer mirrors and fish tanks. Music and TV at reasonable levels, and people can hear each other speak in normal tones. In Manhattan they'd spend a fortune to re-create this; this place just still is. The atmosphere makes up the whole experience. Bet it'd be terrific to come in in the middle of winter. Beef on Weck was just fine, they serve the local craft beer, which was great too.

Old school place where the bartenders still wear shirt and ties. Good beer/wine/food prices! Great staff that treat you well.
