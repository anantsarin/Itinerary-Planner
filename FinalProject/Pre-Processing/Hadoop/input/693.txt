I'm a fan of new foods with different textures and of parts unknown. Halal was surprisingly large for not having a sign up on Rt. 9 to find easily. They were well stocked with a double wide store area. There is a sign in the back, but they lost the star for location and ease of finding. The inside is what you would expect from a middle eastern grocery. A whirlwind of advertising directed at different taste and culture. Rich reds and yellows unashamed mustaches on plump faces. There are so many different kids of food than there is a our markets. I got a cucumber looking thing with unappetizing looking bumps all over it. Food can be an adventure for the adventurous.
