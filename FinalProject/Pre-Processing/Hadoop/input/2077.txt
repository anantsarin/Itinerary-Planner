The Amazing Date: PART I So I've been on a lot of good dates in my life but last weekend I had one of the most enjoyable I have had in quite some time.  I found myself on Niagara Falls Boulevard with my extremely hungry girlfriend and the halfling (her 7 year old son).  So I decided it was time to introduce the little fella to Vietnamese Cuisine and we stopped by Pho Saigon.  While many restaurants in town offer Vietnamese fare as far as I'm aware there are only two restaurants that are actually Vietnamese (Pho 99 and Pho Saigon), the rest are Thai restaurants offering Vietnamese food.  That's like a Greek restaurant offering Italian...its just not right.  I mean an Italian could handle making Greek food...but a Greek making Italian food...give me a break!!  You heard me right my Hellenistic friends...prove me wrong!! In past a past review I rated Pho 99 has having the best Pho in all of Western New York and I stand by that review 100%.  However, Pho Saigon has the best overall Vietnamese Cuisine in WNY.  The MUST orders when you go there are the Vietnamese style chicken wings.  These wings will blow your mind!!  The fried wings are covered in Vietnamese spices and served with sauteed peppers and onions.  They are not saucy by any stretch of the imagination, but there is something about the spice mix which is finger lickin' good.  They use the same spice mix on their frog leg appetizer and quail appetizer which are all quite enjoyable. Another favorite of mine in the grilled pork paste which is basically a Vietnamese style sausage.  Its neon red, garlicky and delicious.   However, on this particular date my girlfriend and I stuck with our favorites at the restaurant...she ordered the lemon grass chicken Bun and I ordered the weekend special soup, Bun Bo Hue.  The Bun at Pho Saigon is the very best in town.  The sauteed chicken with lemon grass is amazing with their salt and pepper spice and the vermicelli noodles with the fish sauce is perfect.  It is an amazingly light and summery meal (that I like to make quite spicy with siracha.) As for the Bun Bo Hue, it is all the crazy meats they stick in their pho (tendon, braised beef, raw beef, tripe) in a chili broth instead of the normal pho broth. So delicious. The halfling opted for pad thai (I know its Thai food in a Vietnamese Restaurant...but give him a break he's 7) which he loved.   While you are there I would also suggest you try the Rau Ma (pennywort) drink.  This vibrant green drink is both refreshing and good for what ails you (whatever that may be).  This may be the only restaurant in town that offers Rau Ma. So with our belly full of fine Vietnamese food we wandered out of the door and spied a place which immediately grabbed our collective attentions... Tune in to my review for Nail Stop for the cliffhanging conclusion of The Amazing Date.
I've been pretty remiss in writing reviews of late, so I am trying to rectify that. My son and I ate here one night after a late run to JoAnns for a pair of scissors. He was a good sport to keep me company on a cold rainy night and the light from the restaurant lured us in. We both love Pho, and it has kinda become "our thing" when we go out to eat by ourselves. The place was deserted (I did mention it was late, yes?) when we sat down, and we quickly ordered large bowls of Pho. It arrived quickly, and after a few drops of siracha, some torn basil, a smattering of bean sprouts, and a squirt of lime we both dug in, he with his fork and i with my chop sticks. It was the perfect thing to ward off both the chill and hunger we were feeling. The broth was nice and flavorful. Not the best I have had (which was in Seattle) but it sure did not disappoint. Despite the late hour and the owner behind the counter counting out the drawer, we did not feel hurried. I'm hoping to try some of their other offerings one of these days, if I can ever get beyond the Pho, because the Hot and Sour Catfish soup sure sounds delish!
OMG! Their Pho Ga is *SO GOOD*!!!! Not like some other places where I taste a bit & have to think about whether I like it or not. Just the tiniest sip of broth & I was like "why did I not order the LARGE instead of this SMALL????" (which is $7.25 btw).  It probably had a ton of MSG in it, but I didn't care cause it was SO, DAMN, TASTEEEE! =D To drink, I had the quintessential Vietnamese Avocado Shake. Exactly like others I've had, except it had something extra that I can't quite put my finger on....extra avocado or condensed milk possibly? This was THE PERFECT MEAL for me. The pho & drink were just AMAZING! =D Some might care that they don't give complimentary hot tea, or that the other customers were Caucasian (usually a mark of un-authenticity), but I definitely did not care! Came for lunch at 1:30 pm on a Tuesday & there was only one other table being served. So service was quick (& friendly). 2 employees working - the 20-something Skater Dude waiter, & the Vietnamese lady cooking the food in the back. Would definitely come back. =)
Ok, I'm kinda pissed at the fact that they didn't honor the restaurant.com certificate because they 'canceled' even though they're in a contract, but restaurant.com can't do anything about it. Whatever. The food is actually not that bad, surprisingly. It's a small little place with Viet and Thai food on the menu. The spring rolls are actually summer rolls with mostly noodles in them. Not really worth it. They also watered down the peanut sauce. I was expecting the big fried tofu, but they're just little cubes. Meh. I heard the pho base was ok, but the pho was definitely different from authentic Viet. I had the sweet and sour basil with chicken and that was not bad, but it's nothing Sriracha can't solve. ;D
The pho was not that good but still better than one other place I've tried since moving to wny. The restaurant is small and seems kind of dirty. The woman doing the order taking and service was very rude. But, that seems to be typical of a lot of places in this area. I wouldn't return to this dump. Continuing my quest for perfect pho in wny.
Go pho is hard to find. They have good pho here. Looked smelled and tasted exactly like rare beef soup. Vietnamese egg rolls were spot on. Fast clean good. This is my new spot for pho.
I like their Pho here. Tastes pretty good for a Pho restaurant in Buffalo (compared to Queens, NY where there are top-notch Vietnamese restaurants). Unlike other places, they mean it when they say "small" for the size. Typically, a size "small" in Asian restaurants in America are more like "medium"s. But here, their portions are precise. Also, I've yet to try them but I've been told that their Vermicelli dishes are really good. I would definitely come back just to try a few of their other dishes besides Pho. Other than the restaurant being SUPER tiny and ghetto looking, I enjoyed my meals there each time I went. Prices are typical range. Plus the servers/manager are super nice! Def worth trying - more than once!
Contrasted with my last review, where I was the only person dining on a Wednesday at 12:30pm- today there were no open tables on a Thursday at 12:30pm. I was offered by the host (and contemplated this offer) to dine at a large table with others, but since I wasn't warmly welcomed by my potential dining cohorts, I opted for take-out. Ordered the vermicelli bowl with pork and egg roll, and a spring roll on the side. Was told my meal would be ready in 15 minutes. Walked over to the Dollar Tree and scored some garage sale signs, little glass bowls, and a couple of packs of gum to keep in my office desk drawer for under $10. Sweet! When I got back to P.S. my meal was hot and ready. Came to just over $10. Got back to my office and opened up my carryout containers... Spring roll was standard and delicious (full of sprouts, lettuce, thin sliced pork, and a couple of shrimp), served with a little side of peanut sauce. YUM. The vermicelli bowl surprised me! At first I thought it was the wrong order. The pork was cooked in a brown sauce with sliced onion. This threw me off. When I've had it in the past, it's been plain meat, no sauce or onions. But this must be how P.S. rolls! It was on top of the noodles (authentic vietnamese vermicelli noodles!), which were flanked with 4 pieces of egg roll, lettuce, cukes, pieces of basil, and sprouts. And to my joy and delight there was a sprinkling of chopped peanuts over everything. YAY! There was no way to mix the contents in that take-out container, since it was A LOT of food! The pork was seasoned really nicely, but I wasn't a fan of the onions added in, so I picked them out. Overall a great trip to P.S. to try something new, since we're no longer in pho season. Happy vermicelli bowl and garage sale season! Haha!
The soup there is perfect!!!
In the mood for Pho and you are shopping near the boulevard mall?  This is the place for you!  In the many years I have lived in NYC, I am often surprised how mediocre the viet food is here.  I walked into this place and was immediately hit by the anise scent of a good pho broth.  The food here is excellent and I recommend this place. If you are an adventurous foodie, I would recommend you try their durian shake. It tastes like a custard-y pineapple but smelled like rotting garbage.  Very strange but worth a try if you are adventurous.
I have eaten here a couple of times and I have only good things to say about each time. It is a small mom and pop type restaurant, which makes the pho here that much more intimate and personalized. Being Vietnamese myself, I am critical of the pho I eat, but this one comes closest to the one I grew up eating. The meat is plentiful and the broth warms the soul. The only problem I would say I have about this place is that the meatball is cut into slices, whereas I prefer mine still round and in-tact. I give this place a 5-star because the owners and staff are very friendly and always welcoming. There has been a couple times where I came near closing, and they kept the store open longer without complaining.
I really like this place. I usually just get spring rolls and a bowl of pho, occasionally a bun. Haven't really ventured much beyond that. The food is so tasty, so much better than pho you get at other places around Buffalo. I love the rolls too. I love that they don't use cilantro, I can't stand cilantro. Interior is not much to rave about but really only here for food. I grew up in Denver where we have a lot of Vietnamese restaurants, the service here is typical, which is to say they'll just give you the food and walk away. They don't even give you the check, you have to come up to pay. If you need anything, I've always just asked, the restaurant is pretty small.
we are visiting Niagara Falls and want to eat vietnamese foods, so we google and find pho Saigon. It is in Amherst in a strip mall. The food is below average and not (Emphasized) authentic at all, it is more Thai. Pho is awful with thick rice noodle, the broth is cloudy and beef cut is thick. The grilled pork with bun and cha gio are the worst. Grilled pork never have sauce!, the "supposed" shrimp paste has added red color and tasted fish paste and pork lard. The cha gio has no meat, only carrots and vermicelli. All the people in our party did not like their food at all. PLease learn how to cook vietnamese food properly, if you dont know how to cook then do not open a vietnamese food restaurant when the food is all thai.. You underestimate the american living in Amherst..
Decent place if craving pho. Seemed standard pho to me (I always go for the rare beef version) and the bun dishes are decent (but lack the variety of places in California that I miss). It was empty when we went for lunch and service was fast. Prices are decent but not super cheap.. around $10/person without drinks.
First time to try some Vietnamese dishes here in Buffalo. The texture of the pho noodles is good, and the soup is even better. Slightly salty though, just don't drink too much. I ordered a rice with shredded pork, chicken and egg too. The meat is not bad, tastes better than it looks, but overall it's just acceptable. The staff and the cook are nice. The price is friendly. $8-$10 for a pho or a rice entree. I would recommend this small restaurant to noodle lovers.
Definitely not the same pho place like at home(Fresno CA) there's barely any condiment on the table beside hoisin sauce and sriracha like it is here :( but at least there flavor of the broth is good, but I feel like anything else I need I have to ask for it.
Small pho here is really small. Owners are very very nice, but their pho beef steaks are rock hard. Broth is also overly salty. I guess I've been spoiled with pho shops around every corner in California, so I really can't complain. Fulfills a pho craving when you are in the mood.
The food at Pho saigon is pretty good.  I've tried a number of items including various versions of Pho and vermicelli and have yet to be disappointed.   What is disappointing is the service (or lack there of).  Save yourself the frustration of eating there and get your order to go. Also, there is a coupon in the Entertainment Book for buy one, get one (although only good for dine in)..
Yummy yummy in the tummy! Great people, great service. Everyone was super nice! BEST PEANUT SAUCE EVER!!!!
I tried this place out on a Monday when my normal pho place, the Red Pepper, was closed. To sum it up, I will never be going back. I didn't drink the water because it tasted funny and when I got my soup, there was a hair in it. I started peaking in back to see what was going on and saw the cook scooping out noodles from a bucket that was sitting on the ground with his bare hands. At that point I had had enough, and was too grossed out to eat. When I went to cash out, the two women at the front were sitting there without any shoes and one of them was massaging her bare feet.  I spent $12 to leave still starving. On the plus side the staff was friendly.
The panang curry was delicious!
The pho here is not bad, but the service is pretty bad.  The soup base is on the salty side and they don't give you cilantro.  Don't get too excited  about this place...  come here as a lasts resort.  Give Saigon Bangkok or Pho 99 a visit before you settle for this place.
Ahem.   So, Pho Saigon.  Hey there.   The first time I ever graced your location I had noodles that tasted like rocks.  This was over a year ago and I was ready to try you again. You did ok, my friend. Your pho broth was delicious.  I would have enjoyed it more, however, if you would have actually given me the bowl I ordered and not a random shrimp one.  And your noodles were ok, once I picked out the little baby ocean critters floating around in the bowl. Your saving grace was the fried spring roll.  It was perfect in every way.  And I loved the extra bean sprouts that piled high on my shared plate. But alas, my dear Saigon, I do not know if I will come and see you again.  It might be worth the drive for pho to those other guys; because for $7 my small bowl there will be much larger than the cereal bowl you served your pho in. Maybe I will see you in vermicelli town, my friend.  I hear you do that perfect. Best regards, Ana
So delish!  I haven't had pho this good since I lived in DC.  The decor isn't much and it's not fancy, but it is so good you won't care!

Definitely one of my favorite places in Buffalo to get my vietnamese food fix! Their home special chickenwings are great and also their fresh rolls are very good. Both the pho and bun dishes are delicious. I have tried also some of the rice dishes like beef cube steak, lemon grass beef or froglegs, vietnamese pork chop or their pad thai noodles with seafood. I basically have never been disappointed. The owner is a great chef and their service is good too. The restaurant itself is very simple but clean. Nothing fancy, but the food makes up for all that! If you're feeling adventurous try out their durian shake. Be warned if you never had durian before and do not know what to expect. It's definitely an acquired taste, but they make a delicious shake here. There's something different here to please all your tastebuds! Excellent prices too. Overall, this place is a winner in my book! Hard working people that deserve your support. Anyway we can't help but coming back and hope they will stay around for a long time!

Ate here for the first time last night, and loved it. Pho Saigon is a small, family-run operation, so there aren't wait staff hovering over you constantly (which I consider a plus). The Vietnamese pancake and the pork vermicelli were both amazingly fresh and savory. The young man who served us was very polite and friendly, and the food came to our table piping hot. I would never have found this place on my own, but I'll be a frequent customer from now on. It will take several months just to sample the  dry extensive menu.
Go pho is hard to find. They have good pho here. Looked smelled and tasted exactly like rare beef soup. Vietnamese egg rolls were spot on. Fast clean good. This is my new spot for pho.
We had the pho, bun, spring rolls, and fried egg rolls. The fried egg rolls were a bit small, but everything else were enormous. Everything tasted great! Must go back soon!

This place is horrible.  I walked in and waited between 5-10 minutes before I saw anyone.  They were all in the back yapping and no one in the front servicing me or the other two tables.  I ordered the pho tai and it was fatty without taste.  The quality of the ingredients was subpar and not fresh.  It was just not a very good bowl of pho.  It can be described as mediocre at best.  The pepsi I ordered was only 2/3 filled in the cup.  Sorry that is bad customer service.  Fill it to the top or give me a pepsi can.  Then it was time to pay the bill.  A large bowl plus a soda was $10.  I don't mind paying high prices if I got high quality.  I got the opposite.  Low quality for high prices.  Horrible!
In the mood for Pho and you are shopping near the boulevard mall?  This is the place for you!  In the many years I have lived in NYC, I am often surprised how mediocre the viet food is here.  I walked into this place and was immediately hit by the anise scent of a good pho broth.  The food here is excellent and I recommend this place.

Price point and quality were both above par of what most places in western ny serve as southeast asian. I like the fact it's a hole in the wall type sitdown it's not ambiance I am looking for when I am at the falls area strip shopping. The value, quality and has such a diverse and delicious menu. I have allergies to fish and seafood and they made certain that the dish I ordered only had soy sauce as the replacement for the fish sauce. The kitchen can be seen from the dining area , something I like. Unlike 99 Fastfood where the kitchen is behind a solid wall and it has one door and a tiny service window, what are they hiding?  Overall I would absolutuely patronize Pho again while shopping in the area or even call for take away. Strangely the Buff news had a review by Andrew Z. Galarneau a few days after we ate there and reviewed it 7 out of 10.
I really like this place. I usually just get spring rolls and a bowl of pho, occasionally a bun. Haven't really ventured much beyond that.

Great vermicelli noodles had with just shrimp then went back and had with pork and shrimp very good sauce more sweet then fishy which we like spring rolls tasty only complaint service a little slow when you come in-like they don't hear the door. Will definitely be back and we are only here for 10 days!
Decent place if craving pho. Seemed standard pho to me (I always go for the rare beef version) and the bun dishes are decent (but lack the variety of places in California that I miss). It was empty when we went for lunch and service was fast. Prices are decent but not super cheap.. around $10/person without drinks.
Food and service sucked, the waiter just stared at us  while taking our orders.the barbeque pork tasted like old marinade meat. Pad thai has green pepper in it and tasteless. Will not recommend this place
Definitely not the same pho place like at home(Fresno CA) there's barely any condiment on the table beside hoisin sauce and sriracha like it is here :( but at least there flavor of the broth is good, but I feel like anything else I need I have to ask for it.
My fiancé and I went about a month ago for a different experience. We didn't have the wonderful meal we were hoping for. We waited forever for a menu, and the waiter forgot our waters twice. Steve got the pho, and he says it was terrible. The onions weren't cooked, very little flavor. I got the duck, which was over cooked and greasy. It was chopped up for some reason, and didn't appear to have much meat on it. I had to dig thru the bones and pick off the meat like a starving animal. The only delicious part of the meal was the only thing they couldn't cook, the bean sprouts. We would not go again.
The food at Pho saigon is pretty good.  I've tried a number of items including various versions of Pho and vermicelli and have yet to be disappointed.   What is disappointing is the service (or lack there of).  Save yourself the frustration of eating there and get your order to go.

Been here a few times over the last year. The noodle bowls were fab the first couple of times we went, but last time we went - a couple of months ago - the portions were a lot smaller and the meat was tough. Could have just been an off day. Their amazing durian shake has us coming back regardless. Small place that's never filled so sometimes it's convenient if we're running errands in the area to pop in for a quick dinner. cheers, (=

Sorry guys, but I just can't get into Pho Saigon. Perhaps I've been spoiled by the Pho places I've dined at in Northern Virginia, in Philadelphia (both cities home to the iconic Pho 75 chain) and even just across the border in Canada. The Pho Tai (rare beef noodle soup) large was $8 and was equivalent in size to the medium at most other pho places I've been to. The broth had very little flavor, and while there were plenty of noodles, the portion of meat was very small. I had to add tons of hoisin and sriracha sauces to make the broth tasty. Service was also very rushed and almost nonexistent. Nevertheless the small restaurant was FULL so I am guessing there are probably no better pho options in this neck of the woods. Next time, I'm staying in Canada and eating at Pho Vietnam 999 in Niagara Falls, Ontario. Much tastier, bigger portions and better service, plus free hot tea.
The pho here is not bad, but the service is pretty bad.  The soup base is on the salty side and they don't give you cilantro.  Don't get too excited  about this place...  come here as a lasts resort.  Give Saigon Bangkok or Pho 99 a visit before you settle for this place.
I have been here on numerous occasions with my dad. The last time was a while ago, but I still remember it being delicious. I always get the homemade lemonade, pho and house special fries rice, and I never get sick of it, nor has it ever been prepared badly. I hope to go back.
So delish!  I haven't had pho this good since I lived in DC.  The decor isn't much and it's not fancy, but it is so good you won't care!
After reading all the good reviews about Pho Saigon, I decided to go for some pho. The broth was very salty and my bowl of chicken pho had very few pieces of chicken (I didn't count how many but compared to other restaurants I've been to, the quantity of chicken was noticeably low). Very recently, I was craving Pho but the restaurant I often go to for chicken Pho does not open on Mondays. I decided to go back to Pho Saigon thinking that my first experience was just a fluke. The second visit reaffirmed my negative experience from the first visit. The chicken pho was very salty. Too salty  that I had to ask for a cup of hot water to add to the soup in an attempt to reduce the salty taste. You can imagine how tasty (not) the soup was after adding about half a cup of hot water. On this visit, my boy friend ordered teriyaki steak, which was served with broccoli. The broccoli was cold and the steak was just okay. He had also ordered a spring roll. For $2 per roll, his spring roll was stuffed with a bunch of lettuce and a hint of carrots and cucumber. According to the menu description of their Vietnamese roll, it should have had other veggies. Well, maybe we came on a bad day but the roll we were given did not contain all the veggies listed on the menu. We also felt that their items were over priced. The price of a Vietnamese spring roll at my usual go-to restaurants is anywhere between $1 to $1:50 per spring roll or $2.50 - $3.00 for two. Sounds like such a small price difference, however, if you like spring rolls like me, you probably will not order one. I gave them one star because the peanut sauce that came with the lettuce-filled spring roll was good. Not the best I've ever had but better than all the food items we ordered on this visit. If you like cold broccoli, paying $4 for lettuce rolls, and too much salt in your Pho, you'll definitely be amazed by Pho Saigon.
Definitely one of my favorite places in Buffalo to get my vietnamese food fix! Their home special chickenwings are great and also their fresh rolls are very good. Both the pho and bun dishes are delicious. I have tried also some of the rice dishes like beef cube steak, lemon grass beef or froglegs, vietnamese pork chop or their pad thai noodles with seafood. I basically have never been disappointed. The owner is a great chef and their service is good too. The restaurant itself is very simple but clean. Nothing fancy, but the food makes up for all that! If you're feeling adventurous try out their durian shake. Be warned if you never had durian before and do not know what to expect. It's definitely an acquired taste, but they make a delicious shake here. There's something different here to please all your tastebuds! Excellent prices too. Overall, this place is a winner in my book! Hard working people that deserve your support. Anyway we can't help but coming back and hope they will stay around for a long time!
Ate here for the first time last night, and loved it. Pho Saigon is a small, family-run operation, so there aren't wait staff hovering over you constantly (which I consider a plus). The Vietnamese pancake and the pork vermicelli were both amazingly fresh and savory. The young man who served us was very polite and friendly, and the food came to our table piping hot. I would never have found this place on my own, but I'll be a frequent customer from now on. It will take several months just to sample the  dry extensive menu.
We had the pho, bun, spring rolls, and fried egg rolls. The fried egg rolls were a bit small, but everything else were enormous. Everything tasted great! Must go back soon!
This place is horrible.  I walked in and waited between 5-10 minutes before I saw anyone.  They were all in the back yapping and no one in the front servicing me or the other two tables.  I ordered the pho tai and it was fatty without taste.  The quality of the ingredients was subpar and not fresh.  It was just not a very good bowl of pho.  It can be described as mediocre at best.  The pepsi I ordered was only 2/3 filled in the cup.  Sorry that is bad customer service.  Fill it to the top or give me a pepsi can.  Then it was time to pay the bill.  A large bowl plus a soda was $10.  I don't mind paying high prices if I got high quality.  I got the opposite.  Low quality for high prices.  Horrible!
Price point and quality were both above par of what most places in western ny serve as southeast asian. I like the fact it's a hole in the wall type sitdown it's not ambiance I am looking for when I am at the falls area strip shopping. The value, quality and has such a diverse and delicious menu. I have allergies to fish and seafood and they made certain that the dish I ordered only had soy sauce as the replacement for the fish sauce. The kitchen can be seen from the dining area , something I like. Unlike 99 Fastfood where the kitchen is behind a solid wall and it has one door and a tiny service window, what are they hiding?  Overall I would absolutuely patronize Pho again while shopping in the area or even call for take away. Strangely the Buff news had a review by Andrew Z. Galarneau a few days after we ate there and reviewed it 7 out of 10.
Great vermicelli noodles had with just shrimp then went back and had with pork and shrimp very good sauce more sweet then fishy which we like spring rolls tasty only complaint service a little slow when you come in-like they don't hear the door. Will definitely be back and we are only here for 10 days!
Food and service sucked, the waiter just stared at us  while taking our orders.the barbeque pork tasted like old marinade meat. Pad thai has green pepper in it and tasteless. Will not recommend this place
My fiancé and I went about a month ago for a different experience. We didn't have the wonderful meal we were hoping for. We waited forever for a menu, and the waiter forgot our waters twice. Steve got the pho, and he says it was terrible. The onions weren't cooked, very little flavor. I got the duck, which was over cooked and greasy. It was chopped up for some reason, and didn't appear to have much meat on it. I had to dig thru the bones and pick off the meat like a starving animal. The only delicious part of the meal was the only thing they couldn't cook, the bean sprouts. We would not go again.
Been here a few times over the last year. The noodle bowls were fab the first couple of times we went, but last time we went - a couple of months ago - the portions were a lot smaller and the meat was tough. Could have just been an off day. Their amazing durian shake has us coming back regardless. Small place that's never filled so sometimes it's convenient if we're running errands in the area to pop in for a quick dinner. cheers, (=
Sorry guys, but I just can't get into Pho Saigon. Perhaps I've been spoiled by the Pho places I've dined at in Northern Virginia, in Philadelphia (both cities home to the iconic Pho 75 chain) and even just across the border in Canada. The Pho Tai (rare beef noodle soup) large was $8 and was equivalent in size to the medium at most other pho places I've been to. The broth had very little flavor, and while there were plenty of noodles, the portion of meat was very small. I had to add tons of hoisin and sriracha sauces to make the broth tasty. Service was also very rushed and almost nonexistent. Nevertheless the small restaurant was FULL so I am guessing there are probably no better pho options in this neck of the woods. Next time, I'm staying in Canada and eating at Pho Vietnam 999 in Niagara Falls, Ontario. Much tastier, bigger portions and better service, plus free hot tea.
I have been here on numerous occasions with my dad. The last time was a while ago, but I still remember it being delicious. I always get the homemade lemonade, pho and house special fries rice, and I never get sick of it, nor has it ever been prepared badly. I hope to go back.
After reading all the good reviews about Pho Saigon, I decided to go for some pho. The broth was very salty and my bowl of chicken pho had very few pieces of chicken (I didn't count how many but compared to other restaurants I've been to, the quantity of chicken was noticeably low). Very recently, I was craving Pho but the restaurant I often go to for chicken Pho does not open on Mondays. I decided to go back to Pho Saigon thinking that my first experience was just a fluke. The second visit reaffirmed my negative experience from the first visit. The chicken pho was very salty. Too salty  that I had to ask for a cup of hot water to add to the soup in an attempt to reduce the salty taste. You can imagine how tasty (not) the soup was after adding about half a cup of hot water. On this visit, my boy friend ordered teriyaki steak, which was served with broccoli. The broccoli was cold and the steak was just okay. He had also ordered a spring roll. For $2 per roll, his spring roll was stuffed with a bunch of lettuce and a hint of carrots and cucumber. According to the menu description of their Vietnamese roll, it should have had other veggies. Well, maybe we came on a bad day but the roll we were given did not contain all the veggies listed on the menu. We also felt that their items were over priced. The price of a Vietnamese spring roll at my usual go-to restaurants is anywhere between $1 to $1:50 per spring roll or $2.50 - $3.00 for two. Sounds like such a small price difference, however, if you like spring rolls like me, you probably will not order one. I gave them one star because the peanut sauce that came with the lettuce-filled spring roll was good. Not the best I've ever had but better than all the food items we ordered on this visit. If you like cold broccoli, paying $4 for lettuce rolls, and too much salt in your Pho, you'll definitely be amazed by Pho Saigon.
