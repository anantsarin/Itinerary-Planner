Went for lunch recently.  Food is good, it comes out crazy hot, but that only means that it was just made for you.  They have really great cupcakes as well ($2.50 ea).  The dining area isn't huge but there were a few tables free so (at least when I went on a mid-week lunch time) no problem there.  I noticed about half the people on line were ordering for takeout.   I had the BBQ pulled pork mac-n-cheese which was really great, and some fried plantains, where were not the twice-fried crunchy ones I like but still very good. The only drawbacks are the passive aggressive sign on the wall above the ordering window and the dour woman at the register who looked pissed off.   Will definitely come again for lunch.
Great restaurant to go with friends to share a few plates. They offer a diverse menu of creative selections and well prepared dishes for both vegetarians and omnivores . They also offer take out drinks like bubble tea, smoothies and the other creative drinks. I love to check in at places but hardly make reviews - having said that, I have to give tons of praise to Twisted Soul... I am a huge foodie (insert weight joke here) and I adore two things - street food and or avant garde food... while these two things are becoming more and more aligned in high end restaurants and with the molecular gastronomy craze - Twisted Soul is able to offer that experience at very reasonable prices. The owners pride themselves on offering diverse plates at prices that don't scare away any type of patron. Be sure to try something with the pulled pork... The empanadas are not to be missed and if on the special menu the Bahn Mi...
Twisted Soul is definitely by far one of the best places to eat in the Hudson Valley. I've eaten at this place twice now and every time I go it is really good food. Their bubble tea is on par with some of the best bubble tea places in the city like Kung Fu Tea and Ten Ren's, and their cupcakes are really good too! Last time I went I had the bbq pork buns, which were AMAZING, chicken lumpia,, matcha bubble green tea, pork dumplings, and a banh mi sandwich as well. If you want a great blend of Spanish, mixed with Asian fusion, and other types of cuisines mixed together, this is the place to go! Delicious flavors, aromatic, a party in your mouth with the many palettes of taste. But the main thing I want to rave on them about is the food they made for our wedding last year! My wife and I were desperately looking for a caterer for our appetizer hour since all our other choices fell through and were way too expensive. Yes! They do weddings! But they are really selective on who they choose, so be sure to meet them in person and talk to them to convince them to make food for you! Lee and Brenda were absolutely amazing for our wedding. We couldn't believe the quality of food, the level of service, and the personal passion they put into all the food they made for us and at the low price they gave us! All other caterers we spoke to were almost twice the cost but not nearly as good of taste at all. I am Taiwanese and was looking for some traditional Taiwanese dishes, but was open to some twists on them as well. Well, given their name is Twisted Soul, Lee put his on twist on scallion pancakes, pork belly buns, sweet potato empanadas, pork dumplings, badass fried rice, and chicken lumpia. We originally only asked for Taro bubble tea, but Brenda and Lee ended up giving us three more flavors for free! We couldn't believe it! AND they decided to make our guests three different types of jellies too!! Regular tapioca, mini-bubbles, and start jellies as well. Unbelievable! All our guests ate so much food from the appetizer hour and were raving about how good everything was that Twisted Soul made. I had a brother-in-law who had never had bubble tea before drink like four cups because it was so good! Lee and Brenda are just foodies who love to eat good food everywhere around the world and try to emulate them in their restaurant, with a little twist on it. And they do it right! Neither of them are Taiwanese, nor even Asian, but when Lee gave me his scallion pancake, I thought, "did he get this recipe from my mom or something?" It was that good! Friendly, family people, who just love food and making connections with people. When you visit you might see their cute kids running around :) If you live in the area and haven't visited them for a meal, you are missing out! My wife and I were there for our anniversary weekend and within an hour of opening, the place was packed and really busy. People flock to where there is good food! Come if you haven't yet! Thanks again for being amazing to us Lee and Brenda!
Twisted Soul makes my heart sing. The food is inventive, flavorful, and always inspired. I held off on writing a review for awhile. Honestly, I go there all the time. But I always get the SAME THING. And I didn't want to write a review based on one menu item. I mean, a place has to be more than a one hit wonder to get 4 or 5 stars from me. But to hell with it.  The pulled pork arepa is the thing that dreams are made of.  I love it, I love it, I love it. And the smoothies? Man they rock!  I consider myself sort of a smoothie connoisseur. But am frequently disappointed by the consistency of many (local) places. Either they are too watery (blah!) or too thick (while the lesser of two evils, still unwanted). But the smoothies at Twisted Soul...man, they are spot on.  Can ice be fluffy?  Seriously, its a frozen dream. And with constantly changing seasonal flavors (my last one was mango/pineapple/ginger), as well as trusted standbys like coffee, taro & passion fruit...you cant go wrong. I'll be sucking down those smoothies in January when its -30 degrees outside, thankyouverymuch. As a side note, I've now finally broken ground and ventured into other areas of the menu (Dumplings! Empanadas! Bubble Tea!) The rotating (weekly?) specials always make me pause. I always want to eat everything on the menu.   But I damn, I love that arepa.
This is the kind of place that makes trying new restaurants worth while. The food is delicious and the cupcakes are addictive.  I have been to a handful of the hottest cupcake bakeries in NYC and Brooklyn but none of them compare to Twisted Souls cupcakes. It takes a little while to get your food so be prepared to be patient. It might take a little bit but it is truly worth the wait. Once you know what you like start calling ahead and don't forget to hit the gym so you can eat one or two cupcakes.
My experience didn't blow me away like I thought it would. I had the Mac N Cheese with Pulled Pork and Arugula (7.5/10), as well as the Shrimp, Crawfish, and Curry dumplings (5/10). I ended up only getting 5 dumplings rather than 6, so I had to wait another 15 mins for ONE dumpling, which didn't have flavors popping out at me like I thought it would. In fact, you couldn't even tell that there was any fish in it. Although the pricing on the menu is very reasonable. The water (tap) is disgusting, but that's like every restaurant. The service was subpar, I sat with empty dishes for a good 25 minutes. Seating was tight and uncomfortable, I could touch the girl's back who was seated behind me. Overall, I'm not sure if it would be worth a trip back.
This place is really stellar.  My wife and I went to my brother's wedding in Maryland, and afterward, we had to part ways since I am working in NYC this summer and my wife was headed back to Mass.  Poughkeepsie happened to be halfway between where both of us needed to be, with convenient access to trains, so we looked up local restaurants on Yelp, and this place looked promising. Let me just point out that Twisted Soul really conveyed the wrong impression of Poughkeepsie for me, having never been here before.  The restaurant was fasionably decorated, with hip music playing, and with great food (I'll get to the food in a minute).  We later discovered that the rest of Poughkeepsie is a ****ing dump. We got the chickpea fries, a couple steamed bun dishes (tofu and pulled pork), and a boba tea.  The food was great.  The flavor combinations were really unusual and delicious, and they did not skimp on the spiciness (the tofu bun) which was much appreciated after spending a week in Maryland where Old Bay is considered to be "spicy".  Also, the restaurant is relatively affordable, student-priced food.  Score! Twisted Soul is right down the street from Vassar which explains our misconception: it's the nice part of town.  The rest of Poughkeepsie is extremely run-down.  Still, I'll make a point of coming back here if I'm ever passing through.
The aroma when you walk in is intoxicating. Staff is not super friendly but who cares because the food is so good. Great variety and special diet requests. Food takes a bit long. But totally worth it.
*they are temporarily closing for remodeling for 3 weeks starting august 3rd!!!* Okay- first- they've expanded. So on the Juliet's side they have the crepes, tamales, and milkshakes. Opposite side of the street they have most of the Asian creations, buns, and the juice bar. We opted for the crepes/tamales. The lady that owns this store is one of the sweetest people ever! Great lady to talk with and super accommodating. Don't get a fried chicken tamale. Why I did this, I have no idea. Sounded interesting. It was interesting, but not particularly good. The pork belly was a winner! Get that! On to crepes- I had a basic French crepe- sugar and butter. It was delicious. I've lived in France and this was a very good crepe. Probably the best I've ever had in the US. Milkshakes- for when you must indulge. Their salted caramel special was epic. Epic. I'll be back. I'll actually be back tomorrow, before they temporarily close :) Hours right now are only 12-5 so be careful!
My mouth waters just thinking about visiting this place again! They specialize in international "street" food like empanadas and dumplings. It's "down home" cooking that gets great reviews for me. I love their empanadas. The only thing is it's not exactly a "dinner" place. It's more like a snack place. Their portions are kind of small but their prices are reasonable. Also, there isn't much wiggle room. Still...don't miss out on this gem!
Will never know if the food is good here--walked out after standing at the counter for ten minutes completely ignored.
Awesome little place to eat.  It's a great menu, prepared by an even greater staff of dedicated people. I definitely recommend the steamed buns and especially the boba teas (bubble tea for those not from the west coast).  The empanadas are awesome as well!  Definitely worth checking out.   It's a small location so it fills up fast, I suggest you get in while you can.  Regardless of how long you may wait, the food is definitely worth it.  The chef works wonders with the ingredients and his special catering menus are phenomenal.
Steamed buns filled with fried chicken, empanadas with corn and goat cheese, noodle bowls with great combinations of protein/veg. Love this place!
I haven't eaten here yet, but I find the whole "concept" concept on their menu a little pretentious. I'm really not looking forward to being at an event catered by this place, but hopefully I'll be able to eat enough beef dumplings to produce my own little dumpling later tonight. UPDATE: Fine food, better dumplings.
Love!!  Many gluten free options, even Churros which is a treat I haven't had since the last time I was in Mexico. They were amazing! Also tried the bubble tea and I highly recommend it. It comes in many flavors of green tea and I got the horchata in keeping with the theme of my meal. So unique and I loved the tapioca pearls or 'bubbles' at the bottom.  A must visit if you are in the area.
Not only is the menu at Twisted Soul filled with the most unique and tantalizing foods in Dutchess County, but it is also really affordable.  If you are looking for a quick delicious meal or even a light snack, this is the place to go.  We had the sweet potato empanadas, passion fruit bubble tea, Ethiopian arepas and jerk tofu arepas. The arepas were by far my favorite dish. I'll surely be dreaming of them until the next time I head over to Twisted Soul!
I've been a customer at Twisted Soul for a couple of years now. Everything I've ever tried was delicious enough that I'll get cravings for it and drive all the way from Fishkill to Pok just for lunch or dinner. And anyone I've ever taken there, loves it just as much. When I eat in, I've always enjoyed the art that's displayed and the music. It's a chill space. That being said, I couldn't quite give it 5 stars. Everything I've ordered there (with the exception of my favorite: Malaysian coconut curry rice bowl) has been a rather small portion for the price. It's clear that the dishes are culinary works of art, but if you're really hungry, you might want to get a side and it gets expensive quick. Another reason for only 4 stars - service is kind of slow, and I'm a pretty patient person. If you have time and are eating in, the wait isn't as noticeable, but if you're getting it to take out, you gotta call ahead, especially if you walk in and they're busy. And if you're on a lunch break? It's almost not worth it. My only other complaint is that the owners have a life and need to close on occasion :( Which is of course understandable, but too often I've decided to eat there and it's been closed..so sad.. Bottom line, the food is so good that it's worth the price and the wait for me. It's still my favorite place to order out of.
It took awhile to get past the name "Food Concepts."  However, it's a genuinely creative and tasty menu.  The food wasn't uniformly good and the portions are small.  GREAT Noodles.
Great food, slow service. I think the service is slow, because they make everything to order, and things are super fresh. Worth trying if you can stand the wait.
Love their lavender lemonade with basil seeds! Most food was amazing the lamb with rice and chicken wings were amazing!! The atmosphere is nice, a little small.   Was not a fan of the empanadas, too dry for me, and the cupcakes were dry as well.
Twisted Soul has been one of my favorite spots to eat in the Hudson Valley for years. I grew up in Miami and this place really satisfies me when I need a taste of home. They really have a passion for what they are producing. The BBQ pork buns are amazing, I have a very hard time not ordering them every time. I could exclusively eat their chic pea fries with Peruvian cheese sauce for the rest of my life and be totally content. Their dumplings and empanadas are always fantastic, as well as the banh mi, platanos con queso fresco, noodle and rice bowls. You just can't go wrong here with anything that you order. Service is sometimes a bit hectic when they are busy but the food makes up for it. Try the yuzu lemonade to drink and definitely have a cupcake for dessert.
this place has awesome food, go get a Caribbean super baguette. Its amazing.
Twisted Soul is one of my very favorite restaurants in Poughkeepsie.  The people who work behind the counter are very nice and helpful.  Dietary needs are definitely taken into consideration here, with both vegan and gluten free items on the menu.  The menu itself is pretty extensive, but there's always something new and interesting to try.  My favorites are the empanadas (the vegetarian varieties) and the Ethiopian barbecue tofu arepas.  There is a wide variety of cupcakes and drinks.  My husband and I have gotten take-out or eaten in here several times this year, and it has turned into an old stand-by for us.
When you don't want to drive into the City for some tantalizing affordable dishes with your friends, stop right in and share your dish at this mom'n'pop foward-thinking restaurant! Recommended: Argentinean Empanadas, Slow Cooked BBQ Pork Steamed Buns, Jerked BBQ Tofu rice bowl, and the Slow Cooked BBQ Pulled Pork Arepas should start you off... mix it in with a bubble tea and you are going to go home full and pleased for the week! NOTE: biggest group size should be 4 since this is a small and narrow venue. It really can't fit any size bigger together.
One of my favorite places to eat in Poughkeepsie.   Try the lemonades, chick pea fries, or the mac and cheese.  some of the dishes you may not have heard of before but there are tame options for pickier eaters.   Clean, fast, delicious, and happy.
Food this creative and tasty shouldn't be this inexpensive.  Fusion of Asian, tropical, southern and more.  Great selection of bubble teas.  Quirky like you want to experience in a college town.
On my quest for delicious local restaurants to support, I stumbled upon Twisted Soul... After reading the reviews, I had to go immediately.  From my first bite, I was hooked.  Everything is so fresh, from the food, to the sauces they give you on the side(which I can only imagine they make themselves), to the smoothies.   The name says it all, authentic food.... *With a twist*... By the end of the meal, you feel satisfied, full and still healthy :) Not that feeling of omg, what did I just do to my body.... I highly recommend this spot to anyone who craves healthy food cooked by people who have a clear passion for what they do... :) Enjoy
The food was great! All healthy and very flavorful. The staff was incredibly friendly and fun to talk to. Overall a great atmosphere and a top notch place to stop in to grab a bite to eat. There were many options to choose from, and everything we ordered was amazing. The portion sizes were perfect and the food was reasonably priced.
Oh my God.  This is a confusing cuisine because it's really fusion everything.  My dish--the ethiopian tofu plaintain Pelpitas (or whatever they call the corn cakes)-- was a combination of south american and ethiopian--who does that?  Anyway, delicious!  also the Twisted Soul salad with sweet potatoes and stuff was outstanding.  It was a little pricey to get both but well worth it--I'll be back when I'm Poughkeepsie.
Um, like hello!!! Twisted Soul, how many times I walked past your door and did not go in? Too many!!! My loss indeed. But I will be making up for it for a long time to come. While out running errands I remembered TS and how many nice things I have heard about them so we went. I was inspired in my choices by uber yelper Daniel L. ordering a.... Bubble milk TARO jasmine tea and the trio of Ethiopian Grilled BBQ Tofu, Corn, Fried Plantain, Peanut and Green Onion Arepas ($7.45). Yum yum delish! I would have ordered vegetarian anyway but probably would not have ordered those two items if not for Daniel's love of taro and Ethiopian food so thanks to him for broadening my gastronomic horizons. We savored our Bobas as we waited for the food portion of our meal. And we waited. And that is not a complaint at all. It is admirable as it is clear that items are made to order and not sitting around waiting to be hopefully claimed. It is quite apparent that the magical ingredient in their offerings is love and passion and respect. You cannot just get that anywhere. I very much enjoyed my Arepa and its gorgeous presentation. The woman who was in front was very sweet and friendly and made the experience that much better. The Boba, my first one ever, was magical. I really enjoyed sucking those chewy black tapioca pearls up that over sized straw. My hubby did too! ;) The space itself is tastefully and simply appointed with white walls, wood floors and splashes of red. There is art on the walls. While we were eating it seems the next artist to be showcased came in to make measurements for her exhibition. We will definitely be back to see that show. Only good things to say about Twisted Soul but since we only had two dishes I will hold off on what will certainly be a future 5 star experience. 4.50 stars youtube.com/watch?v=mmAL… (third time's the charm...)
we liked it a lot! place doesn't look like something you will decide to go in for dinner when you passing by - it looks more like a ice cream parlor.   We went there solely based on reviews on yelp and we were happy we did! Pork and lamb dumplings were awesome, fried chicken noodle bowl with spicy Malaysian curry sauce was very good. Thai ice tea and Thai ice coffee with tapioca pearls at the bottom were just a treat! place is very casual and seatings are "squeezed in" in a very narrow long "corridor like" settings but food is excellent and prices are good! will definitely go back!
Went to Twisted Soul for the second time today and confirmed that I wasn't dreaming, it was exactly as awesome as I thought it was the first time I went.  The empanada fillings are delicious, even if the dough could use a bit more flake, the mexican corn will make you start speaking spanish if you don't already and the BBQ Pork Arepa is out of this world.  We didn't have it this time, but the last time we went we thoroughly enjoyed the BBQ Pulled Pork Twisted Mac and Cheese - it sounds crazy but it is crazy good - and the rice puddings are a great way to finish if you have room. What we really like is that most of the items on the menu are sharable so ordering a number of things and then sharing among friends and family makes the experience all the more enjoyable. As usual, locally owned and operated so vote for local food with your pocketbook.  Go often and support our local food artisans.
I've come to Twisted Soul for lunch a couple of times now, and have also enjoyed several empanadas at their Farmers Market stands. Overall, it's a fun place for a casual lunch that has an interesting "fusion" approach: you'll find empanadas and arepas listed side by side on the menu with bubble tea and noodle bowls. The physical space in which Twisted Soul is set isn't great. Because the restaurant is located in a storefront, the room is very long with little space for diners to sit. Tables of two are on one side of the room, across from the counter, while a single table for four is located in the window. My most recent trip was made on a particularly cold January day, and, the room was very chilly to say the least (we ended up keeping our jackets on). That being said, the local artwork on the wall was a nice touch, and helped with the feel of the place somewhat. During my most recent visit, we waited awhile for our food, which seemed to be a trend judging from the other tables around us. When it did arrive, it was in pieces: two entrees came together, the third arrived a couple of minutes later, and the fourth (a special, which likely took more time to prepare) came a good five minutes behind the third. We weren't in a rush, so this wasn't too big a deal, but it did leave us wondering what would happen if the restaurant was busy. That being said, the servers are very friendly. The quality of the food and beverages was solidly good. I skipped the bubble teas (the texture of the bubbles doesn't appeal) and went with a smoothie despite the cold (it sounded too good to pass up): mango-ginger-pineapple. It was decent: the ginger overpowered the mango and pineapple a bit and the texture could be improved upon (it was a bit fibrous--maybe from the ginger?), but the overall flavor was good. I enjoyed my bf's coffee smoothie much more which resembled a frappuccino, but had a more pleasant coffee taste and was less sugary-sweet. For lunch, I went with pulled pork arepas, which I'd definitely order again. The meat tasted excellent and went nicely with the corn on which it was placed (these would also work well as a dish for the table). The sauce had a bit of a kick to it (a big plus), however, was a bit sweet to my taste. Two of my companions ordered noodle bowls (curry chicken), which they seemed to enjoy. Again, these were a bit spicy (the heat in the broth was too much for one of my companions, who is particularly heat-sensitive, so be warned). The final entree, a special called "the bad-ass rice," was also enjoyed. Overall, the food was solidly good, but the space is a drawback (it is what it is, I guess). I wouldn't come back all that frequently, but would stop by occasionally if in the mood for something different.
One of my favorite places to eat in town. The food is a fusion of different tastes from around the world. The owner, Lee, is a Culinary Institute of America grad--the food definitely reflects this. If you are tired of the same-old-thing, come try Twisted Soul. You won't regret it.
If you're looking for cheap tasty eats, Twisted Soul is the best place to go in Poughkeepsie. It's a perfect spot for a date, but keep in mind they don't take reservations! I'm a culinary student at the CIA down the road, and I have to say I'm always impressed that they manage to create such flavorful options and keep the prices so reasonable. The staff is always very friendly and accommodating to our needs. We had a "dinner party" there for ten people, and the bill was only $90! Total! We did bring our own wine, so that definitely helped our budget. (TS is strictly BYOB.) Everyone was well fed and happy and totally impressed by the Ethiopian chicken wings. Personally, I am completely obsessed with their Chick Pea Fries and the Pulled Pork Arepas. The Leche cookies are pure magic. My advice: Pass on the sickly sweet bubble teas, and bring a $8 bottle of Vino Verde instead.
Small little place, didnt get to explore it all that much but seems cozy. Bubble tea doesnt have too much sugar in it and mixed well, but this place does not offer that many options. Yet enough choices to have at least one great pick.
Now with cupcakes! Which are outstanding.  I recommend the carrot cake. :) The food is great - and unlike anything else you can get in the area.  They do have gluten-free options, if that is important to you.   Most of the time I prefer to get takeout, as the one downfall this place has is the service.  The people are super-friendly and great to interact with, but each dish is made to order and you WILL wait for your dinner.  I can't help but think there has to be a more organized way to prepare and serve the food. That having been said, try the arepas.  They are delicious.  And the smoothies will rock your world.
Twisted Soul has a stand at the Poughkeepsie Farmers' Market. They usually have pulled pork over arepas that's absolutely mouth-watering. They also have empanadas filled with chicken, beef or sweet potato with caramelized onions. If it's a hot day, the bubble green tea and the lemonade with basil seeds are very refreshing.
Went for lunch recently.  Food is good, it comes out crazy hot, but that only means that it was just made for you.  They have really great cupcakes as well ($2.50 ea).  The dining area isn't huge but there were a few tables free so (at least when I went on a mid-week lunch time) no problem there.  I noticed about half the people on line were ordering for takeout.   I had the BBQ pulled pork mac-n-cheese which was really great, and some fried plantains, where were not the twice-fried crunchy ones I like but still very good. The only drawbacks are the passive aggressive sign on the wall above the ordering window and the dour woman at the register who looked pissed off.   Will definitely come again for lunch.
Twisted Soul has amazing food at decent prices -- the empanadas and pulled pork arepas are my favorite, as well as a strawberry banana smoothie. My biggest complaint is the service! The wait time is ridiculous. I do not recommend eating here if you are in any sort of rush since there is no way of knowing how long the food and drinks are going to take. One can't inquire after their food due to their sign discouraging complaining "if you want your food." It is not wise to arrive hungry because you will be starving by the time the food comes out. If you are willing to wait and wait and wait without any sort of indication as to when you'll be getting your food (and drinks), then I'd say go for it. Twisted Soul's food is good. There's no denying that. When it comes, it almost makes one almost forget how long they had to wait for it. Almost.
Great restaurant to go with friends to share a few plates. They offer a diverse menu of creative selections and well prepared dishes for both vegetarians and omnivores . They also offer take out drinks like bubble tea, smoothies and the other creative drinks. I love to check in at places but hardly make reviews - having said that, I have to give tons of praise to Twisted Soul... I am a huge foodie (insert weight joke here) and I adore two things - street food and or avant garde food... while these two things are becoming more and more aligned in high end restaurants and with the molecular gastronomy craze - Twisted Soul is able to offer that experience at very reasonable prices. The owners pride themselves on offering diverse plates at prices that don't scare away any type of patron. Be sure to try something with the pulled pork... The empanadas are not to be missed and if on the special menu the Bahn Mi...
Perfect Baguette and iced coffee with Boba.  love it!!!!

By the end of the meal, you feel satisfied, full and still healthy :) Not that feeling of omg, what did I just do to my body.... I highly recommend this spot to anyone who craves healthy food cooked by people who have a clear passion for what they do... :) Enjoy
Oh my God.  This is a confusing cuisine because it's really fusion everything.  My dish--the ethiopian tofu plaintain Pelpitas (or whatever they call the corn cakes)-- was a combination of south american and ethiopian--who does that?  Anyway, delicious!  also the Twisted Soul salad with sweet potatoes and stuff was outstanding.  It was a little pricey to get both but well worth it--I'll be back when I'm Poughkeepsie.
we liked it a lot! place doesn't look like something you will decide to go in for dinner when you passing by - it looks more like a ice cream parlor.   We went there solely based on reviews on yelp and we were happy we did! Pork and lamb dumplings were awesome, fried chicken noodle bowl with spicy Malaysian curry sauce was very good. Thai ice tea and Thai ice coffee with tapioca pearls at the bottom were just a treat! place is very casual and seatings are "squeezed in" in a very narrow long "corridor like" settings but food is excellent and prices are good! will definitely go back!
Went to Twisted Soul for the second time today and confirmed that I wasn't dreaming, it was exactly as awesome as I thought it was the first time I went.  The empanada fillings are delicious, even if the dough could use a bit more flake, the mexican corn will make you start speaking spanish if you don't already and the BBQ Pork Arepa is out of this world.  We didn't have it this time, but the last time we went we thoroughly enjoyed the BBQ Pulled Pork Twisted Mac and Cheese - it sounds crazy but it is crazy good - and the rice puddings are a great way to finish if you have room. What we really like is that most of the items on the menu are sharable so ordering a number of things and then sharing among friends and family makes the experience all the more enjoyable. As usual, locally owned and operated so vote for local food with your pocketbook.  Go often and support our local food artisans.
One of my favorite places to eat in town. The food is a fusion of different tastes from around the world. The owner, Lee, is a Culinary Institute of America grad--the food definitely reflects this. If you are tired of the same-old-thing, come try Twisted Soul. You won't regret it.
Small little place, didnt get to explore it all that much but seems cozy. Bubble tea doesnt have too much sugar in it and mixed well, but this place does not offer that many options. Yet enough choices to have at least one great pick.
Twisted Soul has a stand at the Poughkeepsie Farmers' Market. They usually have pulled pork over arepas that's absolutely mouth-watering. They also have empanadas filled with chicken, beef or sweet potato with caramelized onions. If it's a hot day, the bubble green tea and the lemonade with basil seeds are very refreshing.
Twisted Soul has amazing food at decent prices -- the empanadas and pulled pork arepas are my favorite, as well as a strawberry banana smoothie. My biggest complaint is the service! The wait time is ridiculous. I do not recommend eating here if you are in any sort of rush since there is no way of knowing how long the food and drinks are going to take. One can't inquire after their food due to their sign discouraging complaining "if you want your food." It is not wise to arrive hungry because you will be starving by the time the food comes out. If you are willing to wait and wait and wait without any sort of indication as to when you'll be getting your food (and drinks), then I'd say go for it. Twisted Soul's food is good. There's no denying that. When it comes, it almost makes one almost forget how long they had to wait for it. Almost.
Perfect Baguette and iced coffee with Boba.  love it!!!!
Creative, well thought out menu; culinary expertise! Great eats. Good atmosphere. Across the street from Vassar College and a variety of other neighborhood treats.

Still love the food here, but the disorganization of trying to order at times can be a frustrating experience, so that's why I've knocked off a star this time.  Food is still worth it and will continue to come.  But I'll try to pick on off hour to visit and realize that you'll have a long wait for both the food and service.

Really good, super creative food. I'm sorry it took us so long to try it out.

Twisted Soul is nothing short of amazing. They have great plays on street food. The food is most certainly from the soul. They have stellar steam buns, and arepas! The prices are super cheap for what you get. There is also a full list of bubble teas and smoothies that rock. Chef Lee has made his impression in Hudson Valley and is here to stay! I would really like to see what he is capable of doing in a fine dining kitchen.

We were visiting and had lunch here. The Ethiopian arepas with plantain is delicious. The rice bowl with pulled pork... Excellent. Aromas are amazing! I would have given this place five stars except long wait and indifferent toward customers. Food is worth it - must try.

Although I enjoy many of their creative dishes, the service is consistently slow and I can't guarantee that I will get food in time to get back to the office or before I die of hunger. I've even called ahead to order and the wait has still been too long. In comparison to other places around here, the bubble tea is expensive for the portion they give you. The food portions are small too so by the time you order your dish with a side and a beverage to fill you up, the price is no longer reasonable. Don't get me wrong -- the food is great, but not for the price or the wait.

Amazing! I would recommend anything on the menu. I love the noodle bowl with this broth that has coconut milk and peanuts, scallions and chicken. The meal is the highlight but do not overlook the leche cookies!

I love this place. The first time I had their food was at the farmers market across from vassar. Ethiopian tofu, arepas, plantains. Sold!  From there it was on... Indian baguette, naughty noodles, shrimp and crawfish dumplings... Oh the dumplings... Everything here is delicious! A weekly spot for me.

The concept is cool, but the bubble tea (Boba) wasn't the best. You can get better at Formosa across from Marist. I am a little bit of a germaphobe, so I didn't appreciate when the girl grabbed the top of the straw with her hands (she was handling money too), and then for some reason she had to put it on the stainless steel counter where she was preparing the drink (I really can't remember why, maybe to put the lid on..).  Small things like that are a big turn-off for me...

Great for a casual and unique dining experience. This place is not Mexican as yelp indicates.... I think it's more Argentinian Asian fusion. Regardless, empanadas are great, chickpea fries are strangely awesome, and always some type of unique drink to try.
Not a huge fan, the food is alright but it's a bit pricey and I find they use much too much salt for attempting to be a bit gastronomical. Maybe I need to explore the menu a bit more, although the empanadas are very good, I'll give them that.

Delicious and fresh vegan dishes, but it takes a long time for the food to come out. The tofu bahn mi was wonderful!

This place is so random. If you are an indecisive diner, you will probably stare at the menu for 30 minutes and get scared and leave -- there are just too many choices, and they're so diverse that it's hard to narrow down and commit to options. But, the quality of the food is such that I'm sure that they could move into a bigger, fancier space and cater really well to larger groups. I went with a group of six, and they weren't busy, so they were able to squeeze a couple of tables together for us. There is zero ambiance. Every time the door opened, we froze. But, as soon as the food started showing up, we forgot all about it and just had a great time eating. The steamed buns are the fold-over variety, and the fillings are amazing. The bubble teas are slightly overpriced, but enjoyable. I had a special banh mi that was great. We ordered about fifteen dishes between all of us -- rice bowls, noodle bowls, arepas, mac n cheese, dumplings, empanadas -- and everyone was satisfied with their choices.

I really wanted to love this place and went there based just on the reviews.   the staff is friendly and the place is okay looking.   to me, tho, the food was waaay too sweet.   I had the pork buns...very sweet....I think I would have liked them if they were savory, not sweet.   also tried the chicken empanada....not too great....the chicken was a bit gamey tasting and the crust wasnt very good.   also tried the kool noodles....didnt like those at all...had a strange taste.   I love different food but this place didnt  live up to the reviews at all.

Great food. The owner is very nice. Took the time to explain the various vegetarian and vegan options. Quite kid friendly as well. Overall a great experience.

chick pea fries were a unique and tasty treat, and the Malaysian curry tofu bowl was very flavorful and just the right portion, the owner (she) was very friendly, if I lived in the area I would definitely be go back
