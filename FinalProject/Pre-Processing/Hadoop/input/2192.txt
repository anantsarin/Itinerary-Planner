got my Masters degree from Cornell. Most enriching experience ever. There's absolutely no boundaries to stop. I've learned so much from my professors, students and friends here. I can safely say, the 1 year spent here has changed my perception of not just others, but myself. The campus is so beautiful! Each day, the view has something new to offer. It's just a pleasure to aimlessly wander around the campus (if one ever gets time!) I'm glad I did this.
Cornell forces you to stretch yourself-- but you will be grateful.  When you graduate, you are part of a tight community- a family.  The shared experience binds all Cornellians together.
Go Big Red! Amazing educational experience, you can grow as much as you want here, you will never reach a ceiling. Explore, explore, explore there is always something new and enriching to be found and had here.
I am typing this review because I know a few of my facebook pals that have graduated from Cornell. The last time I have been there the atmosphere of the campus is remote and nice. (Ha,Ha!)
Honestly, best days (and worst days) of my life during my 4 years here. So what if it's in the middle of nowhere (we really don't care) - there's enough to do on campus, ctown, the commons, and of course, the gigantic greek scene. What I loved best about Cornell was the size and diversity. To get anywhere on campus took 15-30 minutes, so you always stay in good shape just walking to class. Walking from dorms or apartments on class was a beautiful experience and usually involved one of the following: walking around the lake on campus, walking over a gorge and waterfall, or walking up the steepest hill on campus (THE SLOPE). The winters were absolutely brutal but it taught me (a naive, spoiled Californian) how to survive pretty much anywhere else in the world, weather-wise. Nothing like a week of negative Fahrenheit or the famous Valentine's Day Blizzard of '07 to make you appreciate a beautiful sunny day. The snow really was beautiful though. In the winter, definitely trek up to Taughannock Falls to see a frozen waterfall and do not miss sledding down The Slope or sledding down a street in collegetown. My friend and I sledded up and down Oak Ave last year, great memories. Next, diversity and social scene. Yeah, we have the second largest greek community in the US. I was never a member of any sorority or fraternity, but it's impossible not to have a friend who isn't in one. Having close friends in fraternities meant very un-boring (and un-sober) Friday and Saturday nights. Very fun times... but if you're not into greek scene, never fear! There are tons of collegetown parties and bars. And if you're not into the drinking scene, well, there are just so many people at Cornell that you can really be doing anything at night, from hanging out with all sorts of people, cheering on Big Red, attending concerts, playing pool/bouldering on the mini-rock wall in Noyes, to studying in Duffield. Honestly though, the people there were awesome. You could meet someone different every where you go and having such a big student population really makes it easy to find your own niche. SPORTS - how I love you. Cornell Hockey is the thing to do on Friday/Saturday evenings, actually. More can be read on that in a separate review, but living on the east coast really got me into hockey. Aside from Men's Hockey, Lacrosse is excellent (we are the 2nd best team in the nation, having a heartbreaking loss to Syracuse in the finals), our Men's Basketball Team dominates the Ivy League and ACTUALLY MAKES IT to March Madness! Wrestling is good too. Intramural sports are awesome, there are so many things you can play. Intramural hockey... (Co-Ed undefeated champions, baby!), flag football, floor hockey, are just some of the few I played. Our more famous intramural sports include horseshoes and inner tube water polo. Also, our PEs are to die for! Can you believe they actually give us credit for this stuff? I tried to take a PE a semester - snowboarding (I love skiing, but hey, tried something new), scuba diving (got certified with PADI!), archery, and massage. Other classes include bowling, meditation, ballroom dancing, handguns, ice skating, rock climbing, tree climbing... you name it, they got it. Classes... okay. So, I didn't study as hard as I should have. My bad. But, I still took a lot of cool classes. I was in CALS, and their graduation requirements are very relaxed, leaving me able to take classes in all the different schools. Some of my best classes include: History of Rock, Introduction to Wines, Star Trek: Writing Seminar, Cooking, Animal Reproduction (I was an Animal Science major), Nutrition of the Dog, Exotic Avian Husbandry, Chinese Mythology... and that's just a tiny sampling of what you can choose to study at Cornell. That's what happens when you have so many different colleges! Lastly, the campus buildings. So many beautiful, "classic" Ivy buildings like the ones in the Arts Quad, crappy old auditoriums in CALS (now they're renovated, but I still remember springs up my butt in Morrison), but also modern buildings too - Engineering Quad, Lincoln Hall. Such great times here. Definitely attempt to do all the things on the 151, and the following of my favorite memories: slope days, formals, going drunk to the art museum, ordering late night DP Dough, the beautiful Andrew White library, Daily Sun xwords/sudoku during class, making the suspension bridge wobble, stumbling back from Dunbar's, suffering from Orgo, no I'm not complaining but it's always raining, sledding down Libe, IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT, memorizing the alma mater, walking through the plantations, eating lunch/ice cream at the Dairy Bar... watching Bill Nye, Rulloff's TRIVIA... I could go on forever. But, I had the best college experience of my life, and I will always continue to love Cornell. I just graduated, and I miss it to death. Pretty obvious, huh? HAIL, ALL HAIL CORNELL!
I'm biased because honey's father teaches here, but I love the buildings. They are so grand. We got to jog the campus in winter and just watching each snowflake and the gust of snow filled air flow through the crack of each building was so beautiful. I appreciate the humility of the campus's layout. It's just so beautiful, it doesn't have to do anything but stand on its own for us to gush about.
Great school, great location (for an academic institution), great students. I liked it so much I stayed for 2 degrees! :-p
Could not have been happier anywhere else!
I went back for my *coughcough* Reunion this past weekend, and I started crying upon driving onto campus.  Happy tears though, as the beauty of the place overwhelmed me and the memories came flooding back (exiting through my tear ducts, apparently).  There has been a lot of new construction since I left, and while I do not necessarily think it all fits in to the old architecture (I am old school and like the old fashioned feel of a campus, such as the Arts Quad here), I applaud the efforts to stay modern, such as having Gold LEED certified buildings, free wifi, and building atriums in many buildings.   The campus is set on hills overlooking a lake (Cayuga), so exercise is a plenty, and they offer some great physical education classes, from yoga to skiing to just about any sport you could want.  It is an Ivy League School, so while some of our sports may suffer, others such as hockey, lacrosse, polo (among others) are quite good. There are actually seven undergrad schools (Arts & Sciences; Agriculture & Life Sciences; Industrial & Labor Relations; Engineering; Architecture, Art & Planning; Human Ecology; and Hotel Administration), as well as many graduate schools such as business (the Johnson School), veterinary studies and law.  Looking back, I wish I had taken advantage of more course offerings and had paid more attention to my studies.   The campus sprawls over 700 acres, and there is a working hotel, a dairy barn, plantations, a high caliber art museum (see my separate review) and probably anything else you could hope to find (except good weather for too many months, but hey, nowhere is perfect).  We have something called the Hot Truck, which legend has it devised the idea for french bread pizzas and then sold it.  All I know is after carousing or late night studying, those things tasted good; however, I realized last weekend when I am sober and older with more refined tastes, not so much (but I still revere it as an institution).  The town is across a bridge and offers some restaurants, bars, and small shops--your typical college town.  Within a few minutes' drive are more offerings (and on the other side of the hills is another school, but really, we are the only one that counts in Ithaca) ;)   There are waterfalls and gorges (Ithaca is Gorges!) and greenery galore; it truly is one of the most beautiful campuses. I only applied to 4 colleges and thought I really wanted to go to a different one.  But looking back now, I realize my belief that everything happens for a reason is further confirmed by my winding up at Cornell.  *Coughcough* years later, it still has an effect on my life, whether it be the people with whom I still share special bonds, the locale which instilled a love of nature in me (despite the cold and the Ithacation) and which when I am there evokes a feeling like no other (even when I am not there too, I guess) or the education which I believe has prepared me to accomplish nearly anything to which I set my mind (despite my verbosity and imperfect sentence structure here, I really was educated well!).  If I were to have the opportunity to do it all over again, I would eagerly choose Cornell. I could write a review as long as the day and still not be able to put into words how proud and how grateful I am to be an alum. "Far above Cayuga's waters with its waves of blue stands our noble alma mater glorious to view Lift the chorus speed it onward loud her praises tell Hail to thee o' alma mater Hail all hail Cornell." GO BIG RED!
Wow, Deb wrote a review of Cornell!  That is so cool. I haven't gone to Cornell, so I have no right to review it, but I think I'll give it five stars just to amuse myself.  I did visit there once, in the dead of winter, and was most impressed by the ambience:  the plunging, dramatic gorges, the snow-covered cemetery, the gothic stone buildings suggesting grandeur and romance and a sense of history.  I couldn't help thinking what a great college campus it would be on which to wander around thinking romantic, self-indulgent thoughts... at least, I'm sure that's what *I* would have done had I gone there.  Oh, I should add, the friends I have who've gone there are the best, so Cornell must be doing *something* right :-)
great academics shitty weather lack of diverse social scene but hey, it could have been worse
Be careful. Cornell Day Hall tour guides say that "Cornell helps with jobs." This is simply not factual   Note, Cornell is 100% diversity oriented. This means select minorities- See University policy for target-list.  Cornell has good food. It has beauty, and it is unusual that they have the highest suicide of all US schools for last year. There are fences all over the bridges to point to this issue. (i.e. prevent "jumpers")  If you want rigorous schooling, This is the place! If you want A-grades (or B-grades), this is *not* the place.  One third of the Freshmen don't make it to graduation. Perhaps, got to Georgetown, Northwestern, Harvard or Stanford where gradeflation is  strong! Anticipate limited parties unless one is in a fraternity or sorority. People friendly, though
Beautiful campus. Just walking around made me see why this is one of the top colleges in the nation.
I wish when I was picking a college I had brains, I would have so picked Cornell. It's a great school, in a great upstate NY town. The city of Ithaca is a town I could live in, and I'm not a fan of New York, but this town has the feel of a tiny New England town. I may try living here when I retire and start a business along Elmira road.
Thanks. For everything. And, despite what anyone might say, don't change a thing.
Definitely an amazing place to go to school. I miss the beautiful campus, the gorges, college town, and even the classes. Ithaca is filled with things to see and do, and that's saying a lot for a fairly small town in upstate NY.
dear cornell, i love you. regards, melissa ps- i don't miss you in the winter, but in the spring, i totally do.
Beautiful, great atmosphere, academically and otherwise.
Would enroll again in a heartbeat.  Superb professors, libraries, scenery, history, architecture, entertainment, restaurants...  Not to begrudge Yale too much, where I go to grad school, but New Haven could learn a thing or fifty from Ithaca.
GO BIG RED! Went here for my masters. Amazing school! So much to do and learn. Lots of interesting people. Just an amazing campus!
Cornell is a good, rigorous school, and for that, it gets 5 stars.  I got my MEng here in Computer Science, which helped me land a high paying job that I love and have had for the past 5.5 years. Now, that being said, my main issue with Cornell is that... ...they nickel and dime students to death.  They bill on-campus residents for TV service, while most colleges and universities provide this in the base rate.  They bill for using more than 50GB of internet in a month.  They billed me over $600 for the right to park in a lot that was in the middle of nowhere.  Attending most sporting events was a few bucks.  Having family or friends stay at the Statler borders on NYC price levels. This might be fine for undergrads who have parents that are paying tuition, but as a graduate student who was paying his own way, it just annoyed me to no end. Yes, you'll get a world-class education.  Assuming you're major is in demand, you'll stand an excellent chance of finding a great job.  But I felt like the MEng was a financial transaction first and foremost - i.e. while the educational experience was first class, the administration was solely concerned with extracting the most amount money out of me possible.
We rule!  Sure all our sports teams suck.  But we've got the prettiest campus and coolest music dorm.  And the kids who don't flunk out are either smart or crafty; either you stay in b/c you deserve it or you've figured out a way to cheat the system.  Either one is fine.  We're not coddled like those sissies at Harvard, where it's impossible to get in but when you do you've got a giant safety net under you.
Cornell University, the latest and greatest Ivy League.  Far above Cayuga's waters looks she proudly down.   Cornell will challenge you, but you will come out a smarter, stronger, more well-rounded person than when you entered.  Cornell students actually learn.  The saying that Cornell is the easiest Ivy League to get in to and the hardest to get out of (i.e., graduate) is the truth.  But you will learn and grow there and will leave thankful for the experience. Cornellians are also the least pretentious of the Ivy League.  We  know who we are and we're happy with that.  We're not trying to be Harvard, Yale or Princeton because we like Cornell just the way it is.  Cornell has the most beautiful campus in the Ivy League (ithaca is gorges), the most rigorous and academically diverse curriculum (an unparalleled breadth of majors), the most well-rounded student body (the alma mater of Anne Coulter AND Keth Olbermann and Bill Maher), the best athletics (Sweet 16 Bball, top ranked hockey, wrestling and lacrosse) and the best party scene (shh!!!). Go Red or go wrong.
For a big Ivy it was nice, wonderful campus
Cornell forces you to stretch yourself-- but you will be grateful.  When you graduate, you are part of a tight community- a family.  The shared experience binds all Cornellians together.
great university, great courses. tuition is expensive, but worth every penny!

Words can't describe how good this school is.
Words can't describe how good this school is.
Most beautiful campus in the United States.
I am a very proud alum of Cornell University! Wooo! Anytime I hear about Cornell or anything related to Cornell or meet anyone who went to Cornell or wants to go to Cornell or whose daughter is going to Cornell or whose parents went to Cornell (you get the picture), I jump for joy! The winters were extremely cold but the relationships I built there were extremely priceless. My network is currently filled with doctors, lawyers, engineers, entrepreneurs, etc who are very down-to-earth and freakishly brilliant! It makes me smile. I remember the first day I walked unto Cornell's campus as a recently accepted student--I knew when I saw all the happy, cute-geeky, studious- yet professional-looking kids, I would fit right in! In fact, before I applied to Cornell, I was SOLD by their cool "persona" (if I may use this to describe a university), hundreds of majors, hundreds of clubs and organizations, houses, extreme beauty, and famous faculty....and so much more! I could go on for days about Cornell. This review has gotten me severely hyped....I will calm down now. Smooches to my alma mater. Love always.
Hi!!! I was that girl who arrived before your week of finals looking like a tourist! MAJOR tourist attitude! But hot dayum,I was overwhelmed by the chill yet serious and intense atmosphere of the campus! Overwhelmed by the beauty, overwhelmed by the elegance and overwhelmed by how friendly and helpful you guys can be to a tourist like me from Southern California! THANK YOU...I'm coming over!  Hollla!!!
Are there any other schools that offer wine tasting as a for-credit course?? Academics are fantastic. As for the weather...the summers are nice. Be prepared to walk.  A lot.  In the snow.  Up hill. Ithaca is no NYC, but for being pretty much in the middle of nowhere, there's lots to do - great restaurants, independent movie theatres, events etc.
Such uncomfortable seating in the athletic fields, thank goodness the sporting events are great.
Yay! I love you! Despite your harsh winters that always lasted well into spring months and your humid summers that left me drenched in sweat on my way to class, I did quite enjoy the few days of pleasant sunshine and warmth (courtesy of the weather machine). Clock tower, Baker lab, free agenda books in GS basement, studio in Rand, music walk, Dragon Day, Sage Hall, Duffield, a cappella arch sings, Trillium, Happy Dave, quarter cards, cajun fries at Louie's Lunch, bhangra, Slope Day, Riley Robb, gorges, Big red bear! I miss you!
I would have to think for a very long time to come up with anything I didn't like about Cornell.  The academics were very tough, however, that was to be expected.  I felt like most professors were engaging and evaluated students fairly but did expect a significant amount of work and preparation in order to succeed. This only made me want to work harder.   The campus is just breathtaking.  I honestly felt like I was living in another country while on campus.  The old stone architecture, the bridges, waterfalls, gorges, large grassy areas for relaxation, plantations and trails.  I could live on campus and never leave.  There is just so much to take in. Off campus is just as interesting.  From college town to downtown Ithaca, the were plenty of quaint dining options and shopping.  Wegmans is just a few miles away, which is also a plus!  The hills will keep you in shape and the weather is inconsistent, but it's upstate NY! Winters are harsh, but beautiful.  First few weeks of dorm life in August are stifling.  But can't control mother nature! There are several scenic parks nearby, with gorgeous falls and hiking trails.  And of course, the campus overlooks the beautiful fingerlakes.   One complaint:  THE CROOKED landlords of collegetown.  What a bunch of dumpy properties they run, and they will rip you off left and right.   Students were friendly and there was more than enough activities, sports, clubs for all interests.  The food was spectacular, and I stayed on meal plan all four years because it was that good.  So many dining choices, large salad bars, vegetarian options and decadent desserts.  It was pure enjoyment at meal time!  Overall, I wouldn't pick any other university to attend if I were to do it all over again.  It was an amazing experience in so many ways and I highly recommend this university to anyone who doesn't mind putting in A LOT of hard work while having some of the most amazing experiences/memories that last a lifetime.
got my Masters degree from Cornell. Most enriching experience ever. There's absolutely no boundaries to stop. I've learned so much from my professors, students and friends here. I can safely say, the 1 year spent here has changed my perception of not just others, but myself. The campus is so beautiful! Each day, the view has something new to offer. It's just a pleasure to aimlessly wander around the campus (if one ever gets time!) I'm glad I did this.
I attended one of Cornell's graduate programs and learned the difference between a Private and a Public education. One of the MANY things that impressed me about my education was that Cornell spent considerable time finding the right mixture of classmates to FUEL my education. You will learn 50% from your classmates, so don't underestimate how important they will be in your educational life and as an alumni. Cornell was heads and shoulders above my "Ivy League West" undergraduate program and I will always be in admiration of my experiences there: 1. Sledding down Senaca St during the Blizzard! CRAZY! 2. Having the home #s of our professors! Not that I used those numbers, but,. WOW, what access! 3. Professors who WANT you to learn and be SUCCESSFUL. You won't be a number! 4. Classmates from around the world. Where else would you dine with such a broad, educated group! I learned as much from our dinner discussions as from the lectures - THANK YOU Classmates! 5.Ruloff's - enough said. 6. Dancing until 6am with Los Chicos Latinos! (Ey' caramba estamos calientes!) 7. glenwoodpines.com/new/in… 8. The best date of my life: tasteofthaiithaca.com (Any dinner date that lasts 7 hours is a great date!) 9. Potter Falls for a little nude sunbathing 10. For everything that made me a better person! Would I do it again? In a heartbeat!
Go Big Red! Amazing educational experience, you can grow as much as you want here, you will never reach a ceiling. Explore, explore, explore there is always something new and enriching to be found and had here.
Great school, brand, career opportunities, supportive staff, welcoming atmosphere, friendly people. But there are definite improvements that can be made. Academic workload vary significantly depending on major. Some majors skate by while others suffer even if they are going for the same jobs. Also too many requirements for certain colleges. For example arts and sciences... breadth and depth, and foreign language, PE, etc. And also the swim test? I didn't have to touch water the 4 years I've been here, though I chose to. Many professors for certain types of classes are quite bad at teaching (ex. Econ), even if they are fantastic researchers. What I am quite angry about about is a professor who was by far one of the best lecturers I have ever had here (across all disciplines) got laid off because she did not have enough research and thus no tenure. Good job replacing good lecturers (and thus the only part of the education that is relevant to me). Finding a balance is surely important, but if you can't recognize this professor for what she is capable of at the undergraduate teaching level, then you're abandoning over half of your student population. Less important complaints: Ctown apartments are crazy expensive, and west campus housing has the same problem. And what, no free gym? What is up with that? This sounds overall to be a negative rant, but it is not, I am very grateful for the education I received here and donated to the alumni fund as well. It is simply the case that there are pressing issues that need to be brought to light and remedied immediately. It might also seem weird that I'm reviewing a University on Yelp. But hey, I'm a Yelp Elite, my job is to review everything under the sun.
Honestly, best days (and worst days) of my life during my 4 years here. So what if it's in the middle of nowhere (we really don't care) - there's enough to do on campus, ctown, the commons, and of course, the gigantic greek scene. What I loved best about Cornell was the size and diversity. To get anywhere on campus took 15-30 minutes, so you always stay in good shape just walking to class. Walking from dorms or apartments on class was a beautiful experience and usually involved one of the following: walking around the lake on campus, walking over a gorge and waterfall, or walking up the steepest hill on campus (THE SLOPE). The winters were absolutely brutal but it taught me (a naive, spoiled Californian) how to survive pretty much anywhere else in the world, weather-wise. Nothing like a week of negative Fahrenheit or the famous Valentine's Day Blizzard of '07 to make you appreciate a beautiful sunny day. The snow really was beautiful though. In the winter, definitely trek up to Taughannock Falls to see a frozen waterfall and do not miss sledding down The Slope or sledding down a street in collegetown. My friend and I sledded up and down Oak Ave last year, great memories. Next, diversity and social scene. Yeah, we have the second largest greek community in the US. I was never a member of any sorority or fraternity, but it's impossible not to have a friend who isn't in one. Having close friends in fraternities meant very un-boring (and un-sober) Friday and Saturday nights. Very fun times... but if you're not into greek scene, never fear! There are tons of collegetown parties and bars. And if you're not into the drinking scene, well, there are just so many people at Cornell that you can really be doing anything at night, from hanging out with all sorts of people, cheering on Big Red, attending concerts, playing pool/bouldering on the mini-rock wall in Noyes, to studying in Duffield. Honestly though, the people there were awesome. You could meet someone different every where you go and having such a big student population really makes it easy to find your own niche. SPORTS - how I love you. Cornell Hockey is the thing to do on Friday/Saturday evenings, actually.

(Co-Ed undefeated champions, baby!), flag football, floor hockey, are just some of the few I played. Our more famous intramural sports include horseshoes and inner tube water polo. Also, our PEs are to die for! Can you believe they actually give us credit for this stuff? I tried to take a PE a semester - snowboarding (I love skiing, but hey, tried something new), scuba diving (got certified with PADI!), archery, and massage. Other classes include bowling, meditation, ballroom dancing, handguns, ice skating, rock climbing, tree climbing... you name it, they got it. Classes... okay. So, I didn't study as hard as I should have. My bad. But, I still took a lot of cool classes. I was in CALS, and their graduation requirements are very relaxed, leaving me able to take classes in all the different schools. Some of my best classes include: History of Rock, Introduction to Wines, Star Trek: Writing Seminar, Cooking, Animal Reproduction (I was an Animal Science major), Nutrition of the Dog, Exotic Avian Husbandry, Chinese Mythology... and that's just a tiny sampling of what you can choose to study at Cornell. That's what happens when you have so many different colleges! Lastly, the campus buildings. So many beautiful, "classic" Ivy buildings like the ones in the Arts Quad, crappy old auditoriums in CALS (now they're renovated, but I still remember springs up my butt in Morrison), but also modern buildings too - Engineering Quad, Lincoln Hall. Such great times here. Definitely attempt to do all the things on the 151, and the following of my favorite memories: slope days, formals, going drunk to the art museum, ordering late night DP Dough, the beautiful Andrew White library, Daily Sun xwords/sudoku during class, making the suspension bridge wobble, stumbling back from Dunbar's, suffering from Orgo, no I'm not complaining but it's always raining, sledding down Libe, IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT, memorizing the alma mater, walking through the plantations, eating lunch/ice cream at the Dairy Bar... watching Bill Nye, Rulloff's TRIVIA...

HAIL, ALL HAIL CORNELL!
Congrats, Big Red - you get your fifth star. I wouldn't be who I am without you. Now, if only I could get published so I can live up to the post-degree expectations you have of me.
Great school, great location (for an academic institution), great students. I liked it so much I stayed for 2 degrees! :-p
Although I almost dropped out of Cornell for failing a pre-requisite Physics course for Engineers, I am grateful I earned my B.A. in English from the College of Arts and Sciences.  I conisder myself extremely lucky to have graduated from such a prestigious and well-respected university. Whenever you tell people you graduated from Cornell, they automatically think you are a genius or at the very least super smart. I was just one of those fortunate dudes from Southern California that was able to graduate from an Ivy League institution. At times I questioned my decision. The weather was brutal. Being from Chula Vista, CA the cold Ithaca winters wore me down. However, the education is second to none, and you are constantly being challenged to do your best and improve upon your previous academic successes. Being an alumnus opens doors for you- no doubt about it! What I hated: The weather- TOO COLD AND DREARY! Sometimes I didn't see the sunshine for 5 days straight. The lake effect blows! Being so far from California! The Greek System. My Harvard and Princeton-educated academic advisor- the guy was an arrogant jerk Cut-throat attitude of most New Yorkers in my classes What I love(d): Schoellkopf Field Willard Straight Hall Sage Chapel The whole campus- especially the Gorges The friends I made Friday nights Playing lightweight football Some of my professors Slope Day. Dragon Day. The faculty. Wines course- who doesn't love a buzz in the early afternoon. The memories and a bunch of other stuff. All in all, I am glad I went to Cornell; but I wish more than just one of my undergraduate buddies lived on the west coast . Living and working in the SF Bay Area it most likely would have been more advantageous had I graduated from Berkeley or Stanford, but I love my alma mater nonetheless! GO BIG RED forever!!!
I went back for my *coughcough* Reunion this past weekend, and I started crying upon driving onto campus.  Happy tears though, as the beauty of the place overwhelmed me and the memories came flooding back (exiting through my tear ducts, apparently).  There has been a lot of new construction since I left, and while I do not necessarily think it all fits in to the old architecture (I am old school and like the old fashioned feel of a campus, such as the Arts Quad here), I applaud the efforts to stay modern, such as having Gold LEED certified buildings, free wifi, and building atriums in many buildings.   The campus is set on hills overlooking a lake (Cayuga), so exercise is a plenty, and they offer some great physical education classes, from yoga to skiing to just about any sport you could want.  It is an Ivy League School, so while some of our sports may suffer, others such as hockey, lacrosse, polo (among others) are quite good. There are actually seven undergrad schools (Arts & Sciences; Agriculture & Life Sciences; Industrial & Labor Relations; Engineering; Architecture, Art & Planning; Human Ecology; and Hotel Administration), as well as many graduate schools such as business (the Johnson School), veterinary studies and law.  Looking back, I wish I had taken advantage of more course offerings and had paid more attention to my studies.   The campus sprawls over 700 acres, and there is a working hotel, a dairy barn, plantations, a high caliber art museum (see my separate review) and probably anything else you could hope to find (except good weather for too many months, but hey, nowhere is perfect).  We have something called the Hot Truck, which legend has it devised the idea for french bread pizzas and then sold it.  All I know is after carousing or late night studying, those things tasted good; however, I realized last weekend when I am sober and older with more refined tastes, not so much (but I still revere it as an institution).  The town is across a bridge and offers some restaurants, bars, and small shops--your typical college town.  Within a few minutes' drive are more offerings (and on the other side of the hills is another school, but really, we are the only one that counts in Ithaca) ;)   There are waterfalls and gorges (Ithaca is Gorges!) and greenery galore; it truly is one of the most beautiful campuses. I only applied to 4 colleges and thought I really wanted to go to a different one.  But looking back now, I realize my belief that everything happens for a reason is further confirmed by my winding up at Cornell.  *Coughcough* years later, it still has an effect on my life, whether it be the people with whom I still share special bonds, the locale which instilled a love of nature in me (despite the cold and the Ithacation) and which when I am there evokes a feeling like no other (even when I am not there too, I guess) or the education which I believe has prepared me to accomplish nearly anything to which I set my mind (despite my verbosity and imperfect sentence structure here, I really was educated well!).  If I were to have the opportunity to do it all over again, I would eagerly choose Cornell. I could write a review as long as the day and still not be able to put into words how proud and how grateful I am to be an alum. "Far above Cayuga's waters with its waves of blue stands our noble alma mater glorious to view Lift the chorus speed it onward loud her praises tell Hail to thee o' alma mater Hail all hail Cornell." GO BIG RED!
My alma mater :'-) Despite the blistering heat and sub-zero temperatures, the near-hysterical and stressful all-nighters, the server crashes during course enroll, the unreasonable line for a Statler Terrace salad, the ugly fences erected on the bridges, the frequent edition changes of textbooks, and the roller-coaster of emotions I've experienced thanks to my undergraduate years in Ithaca... you'll always remain a formative and treasured season of my life. x3
great academics shitty weather lack of diverse social scene but hey, it could have been worse
I must have been one lucky 17-yr old to have chosen Cornell. My whole deal in high school was to NOT attend an Ivy League school.  I was tired of dealing with the honor students and their attitudes, and I felt I'd get more of the same at an Ivy.  So when I started getting Cornell's brochures in the mail junior year, I'm all, oh, this place sounds pretty cool!  Mind you, they didn't mention they were an Ivy.  And I didn't think to check it out beforehand. It wasn't until after I stepped foot on CAMPUS and saw kids running around with Cornell sweatshirt version 62.8 or something with The Ivy League stitched down the sleeve with a drawing of an ivy vine, and meeting all of these bitter kids that didn't get into Harvard or Stanford that ran around wearing those sweatshirts that I got a clue. I'm still Queen of the Clueless, but I still can't believe I didn't learn it was an Ivy until after I accepted, packed my earthly belongings, and made the 13 hour drive from home to Ithaca, New York. Anyway...I was a history major, and all classes here were top-notch.  How cool is it to wake up one cold, Ithaca morning, turn on NPR, and realize your professor's on the radio?  Took astronomy and saw Saturn using the telescope at Fuertes Observatory.  Managed to score two hotel classes senior year: Cooking in the Fall, and the ever popular Wines in the Spring (which I swear almost caused me NOT to graduate b/c I just could NOT memorize which grape came from where, and I thought I failed the final, and it wasn't until I pulled out my actual, real diploma from the packet and not the blank sheet for those who still needed to fulfill requirements that I knew that I actually graduated.  Jeez...) The social scene was alright, wasn't really into it at the time, but I've made some great friends that I'm close to to this day.  I was fortunate enough to be in the wedding party for two of my senior year housemates.  I finally got to stay in the Statler, and the ceremony was in Sage Hall.  So Cornellian.  And the best thing about Cornell is its great alumni network.  Being in SF it seems I run into more Cornellians than before. So even though I seemed to have attended Cornell by sheer dumb luck, it was the luckiest choice I've ever made.  You can't get a better education.
Beautiful campus. Just walking around made me see why this is one of the top colleges in the nation.
Let's get this straight, Cornell is an amazing school. But it's stressful. It's cold. Especially a kid from California. Yeah... But it's fun and so worth it, if you try. I'm gonna miss this place when I leave. Sigh.
Dear Ezra Cornell, I've enjoyed spending time at your academic institution during my graduate years. I loved to hear the chimes from my apartment at Thurston Ave and you're the reason why I came out from sunny California to, well, Ithaca winter( I've learned to shovel snow and scrap windshield in the process)! You might have to explain to me why there is a sundial by Goldwin Smith Hall. lol. I enjoyed going to the Big Red Barn for Grad TGIF, Cornell Dairy store, and aww...the Upstate NY apple cider and cider donuts! :-)  I love your traditions such as Slope Day and Dragon Day, as well as reunion week where alum wear red jackets and smoke cigars in tents with cheese and wine while the undergrads and grad took care of your kids (I had fun doing that). I also loved walking along Beebe lake and just watching the gorges! I would love to come back to visit soon! Best of all, Ithaca is gorges! Sincerely, Your nephew, MAT '05
Thanks. For everything. And, despite what anyone might say, don't change a thing.
Most beautiful campus in the United States.
dear cornell, i love you. regards, melissa ps- i don't miss you in the winter, but in the spring, i totally do.
I am a very proud alum of Cornell University! Wooo! Anytime I hear about Cornell or anything related to Cornell or meet anyone who went to Cornell or wants to go to Cornell or whose daughter is going to Cornell or whose parents went to Cornell (you get the picture), I jump for joy! The winters were extremely cold but the relationships I built there were extremely priceless. My network is currently filled with doctors, lawyers, engineers, entrepreneurs, etc who are very down-to-earth and freakishly brilliant! It makes me smile. I remember the first day I walked unto Cornell's campus as a recently accepted student--I knew when I saw all the happy, cute-geeky, studious- yet professional-looking kids, I would fit right in! In fact, before I applied to Cornell, I was SOLD by their cool "persona" (if I may use this to describe a university), hundreds of majors, hundreds of clubs and organizations, houses, extreme beauty, and famous faculty....and so much more! I could go on for days about Cornell. This review has gotten me severely hyped....I will calm down now. Smooches to my alma mater. Love always.
Would enroll again in a heartbeat.  Superb professors, libraries, scenery, history, architecture, entertainment, restaurants...  Not to begrudge Yale too much, where I go to grad school, but New Haven could learn a thing or fifty from Ithaca.
Are there any other schools that offer wine tasting as a for-credit course?? Academics are fantastic. As for the weather...the summers are nice. Be prepared to walk.  A lot.  In the snow.  Up hill. Ithaca is no NYC, but for being pretty much in the middle of nowhere, there's lots to do - great restaurants, independent movie theatres, events etc.
Cornell is a good, rigorous school, and for that, it gets 5 stars.  I got my MEng here in Computer Science, which helped me land a high paying job that I love and have had for the past 5.5 years. Now, that being said, my main issue with Cornell is that... ...they nickel and dime students to death.  They bill on-campus residents for TV service, while most colleges and universities provide this in the base rate.  They bill for using more than 50GB of internet in a month.  They billed me over $600 for the right to park in a lot that was in the middle of nowhere.  Attending most sporting events was a few bucks.  Having family or friends stay at the Statler borders on NYC price levels. This might be fine for undergrads who have parents that are paying tuition, but as a graduate student who was paying his own way, it just annoyed me to no end. Yes, you'll get a world-class education.  Assuming you're major is in demand, you'll stand an excellent chance of finding a great job.  But I felt like the MEng was a financial transaction first and foremost - i.e. while the educational experience was first class, the administration was solely concerned with extracting the most amount money out of me possible.
Yay! I love you! Despite your harsh winters that always lasted well into spring months and your humid summers that left me drenched in sweat on my way to class, I did quite enjoy the few days of pleasant sunshine and warmth (courtesy of the weather machine). Clock tower, Baker lab, free agenda books in GS basement, studio in Rand, music walk, Dragon Day, Sage Hall, Duffield, a cappella arch sings, Trillium, Happy Dave, quarter cards, cajun fries at Louie's Lunch, bhangra, Slope Day, Riley Robb, gorges, Big red bear! I miss you!
Cornell University, the latest and greatest Ivy League.  Far above Cayuga's waters looks she proudly down.   Cornell will challenge you, but you will come out a smarter, stronger, more well-rounded person than when you entered.  Cornell students actually learn.  The saying that Cornell is the easiest Ivy League to get in to and the hardest to get out of (i.e., graduate) is the truth.  But you will learn and grow there and will leave thankful for the experience. Cornellians are also the least pretentious of the Ivy League.  We  know who we are and we're happy with that.  We're not trying to be Harvard, Yale or Princeton because we like Cornell just the way it is.  Cornell has the most beautiful campus in the Ivy League (ithaca is gorges), the most rigorous and academically diverse curriculum (an unparalleled breadth of majors), the most well-rounded student body (the alma mater of Anne Coulter AND Keth Olbermann and Bill Maher), the best athletics (Sweet 16 Bball, top ranked hockey, wrestling and lacrosse) and the best party scene (shh!!!). Go Red or go wrong.
