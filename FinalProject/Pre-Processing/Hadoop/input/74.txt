Gear for Adventure is how a small business should be run. This locally owned store is run by Sarah and Kevin, a friendly couple who are super knowledgeable about everything outdoors. I was in this store for almost three hours hours trying out packs, boots, and tents. As someone who was a complete novice to hiking, the owners helped me find everything I need, and educated me on the importance of having the right gear. I felt comfortable asking questions and they didn't appear to be irritated by my ignorance. They also didn't "push" the more expensive products on me. Because Gear for Adventure was originally an online-only store, they have competitive prices. Their prices rival most other online stores, except you don't have to pay for shipping (if you go to their physical location). Whether your a beginner hiker or an advanced outdoors-lover, this is the store for you. Summary: Friendly owners + competitive prices + locally owned business = Five stars. You can't go wrong here.
