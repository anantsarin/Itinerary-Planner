Service was good but the food was disappointing. The appetizer was just slightly warm, my wife's pasta was barely cooked and my duck was smothered with onions and grapes. We have been here before and liked it but was very dissatisfied this time.
Great food!  The sorbet/ice cream in the middle of the meal is such a nice touch!  Last fall they had pumpkin ice cream and it was so good!  The place is a little more pricey than other places in the area, but worth the price!
The duck was perfect! Best I've had and my husband was very very with the pork belly.
We were so excited when we heard about this restaurant several years ago.  The area around Chautauqua, NY isn't great cuisine country, so off we went to try it.  We thought it was wonderful.  Then.  Best scallops ever, nothing wrong with the meal.  While the atmosphere is dark and somewhat gloomy, there were lots of people, friendly noise, good service.   Fast forward to last summer.  We went again, expecting at least somewhat the same quality, and were disappointed.  Perfunctory service, ordinary food and it seemed even gloomier.  Optimists, we thought that might be an anomaly, so we tried it again this week after arriving in the area for the summer. We were seated immediately, which was good.  Our server arrived promptly.  Then the problems began.  We ordered and started with salad.  Nothing arrived at the table for almost half an hour.  Finally our server brought the salads and a basket of bread. No apology or even explanation.  Seemed to be an ordinary event.  The basket held four small pieces of bread, two different kinds, which meant people didn't get their choices.  I'm sure we could have asked for more had we seen him.  But after dropping off the salads, he disappeared again. This is not a cheap restaurant.  For $28 entree, I'd expect a real basket of bread and attentive service.  But the worst was yet to come.  I ordered the tuna rare to medium rare.  I got sushi.  Cold and nearly raw.  When I flagged him down to say it was cold he said that's how they serve it.  To me it tasted as if it had been made yesterday and pulled out of the fridge.  They "warmed" it up and it tasted as if it had been microwaved, but at least I could cut and eat it.  The noodles were almost mush, clearly overcooked and overseasoned.  The tempura broccolini (delicious) was only a garnish, but the best thing on the plate. We won't go back, and that's a shame.  You can't charge these kinds of prices, render that kind of off-handed service and mediocre food and expect diners to return.  I find this sad.
How do I begin, this has been our favorite restaurant for years, however tonite we are 55 min in and just getting salad and lol two pieces of bread lol must ne a bread shortage. So at least 20 min after this no main course. Sad that this was a really good restaurant until now! 50 min later finally arrived, I ordered the pan seared scallops, they were microwaved,  so sad took all the flavor away.
The food was really good. The service was above average. They are trying hard to be a fine dining establishment. Seeing as there aren't too many really nice restaurants in this small town, I'm sure they will do just fine. The only real drawback is that place is really small so it can get very loud. Found many times I could barely hear my wife over the noise level.
Delicious! Everything we had was fantastic, especially the pasta with lobster and the halibut. Best meal of our vacation!  If you are looking for a nice restaurant in the Chautauqua Lake area you need to check out the Scallion Bistro, you won't be sorry.
Food definitely is pricey, but oh so worth it! Salads were fresh and super delish, the sorbet was a nice surprise. Atmosphere is great. A bit noisy, yes, but it's only from people talking, not music blaring at you like at other places. Will go back many times!
Located in the Village of Lakewood, Scallion is indeed one of the area's finer restaurants not only serving delicious beautifully prepared and presented food, but also super friendly with a pleasant atmosphere about it. I had the seared scallops which came perfectly prepared, were extremely tasty and served upon a bed of julienned vegetables with a totally divine flavored cream sauce which I highly recommend. My guests opted for a marlin fish (rather unusual for this area) special with which they were also delighted. We also had several drinks which were free poured to full measure and several glasses of wine, which wine options I found to be rather complete for a small restaurant. Scallion is popular so I would suggest making advance reservations.
Four of us, two from Cleveland, Ohio and two from Portland, Oregon ate here in October.  I quite enjoyed the food.  My wife and I split the butternut squash soup, duck breast appetizer, tenderloin steak and dessert of tiramisu.  We find that tiramisu is quite popular in western New York.  The restaurant had a few weak points though.  The only sparkling wine was spumante.  The vodka tonics were poorly prepared and no espresso.  The wait staff were not polished and made serving errors.  Overall though, worth the visit.
My parents had a bad experience here. My mom had the cedar plank salmon which was served raw in the center and cold throughout. My dad had the ahi tuna which had very little taste and was generally uninspired. My family and I ate here over a year ago and it was quite good, but it sounds like the quality of food and attention to detail has since suffered. Beware.
