although we can not tell the menu in English about the food. but the girl serving us can speak Chinese!  the girl, only staff in the restaurant, was patient and nice. the food i took seems a huge plate of salad with little rice but tastes very good.
The sushi and tempura were good considering the price and the rural location of the restaurant. Only critique is that sauce for the unagi don and agedashi tofu is too sweet, which may taste good for some, but I would not consider it the traditional Japanese taste.
I miss this place so much. I am korean and I live in LA but the Korean food at Ithaca's Asia Cuisine is solid especially if you are vegetarian. You can enjoy classic Korean-chinese dishes like Jjambong and JjaJangMyun without bending your dietary restrictions. It is well priced. The noodle soups are perfect for those cold days in Ithaca. I want to go back when I visit Ithaca this month.
I've eaten here twice during lunchtime and took advantage of their bento box lunch special both times. Under $10. Very fresh, tasty and authentic. Although bento box meals are traditionally Japanese they offered Korean dishes in them also.  Situated right on the SW corner of W. Seneca and N. Aurora you can also engage in some great people watching if you get a window seat.
(3.5 stars) Generally, I avoid any kind of pan Asian place- I think of the phrase "jack of all trades, master of more."  But, when in Rome (or Ithaca)... We started with the avocado salad which is a perfectly ripe avocado cut I'm wedges served over seaweed with a delicate sesame dressing- perfect for a summer evening.  The steamed shumai were considerably less exciting - on par with what I get from Trader Joes.  And then a huge,pot of noodles served with squid and shrimp in a black bean sauce (which tasted more like hossain sauce).  This was tasty enough but very monotonous and I couldn't help thinking that this was a dish desperately in need of veggies to ease the boredom and to cut some of the sweetness.  The noodles, though, had a delightful and surprisingly complex wheaty taste.  I can't end the review without mentioning a sweet green tea so good (and so smooth!) that I almost asked for two more to go. Forgive the bad chairs and the general lack of atmosphere, and the somewhat flustered waitstaff.
This is a nice place to go for a cheap lunch in Ithaca. Light-filled with a big brick wall, Asia Cuisine is casual, cute and serves good food. Their bento boxes are wonderful - I particularly like their tempura and noodles. Otherwise, their sushi is the best I've had in the area. I particularly like their sweet potato and avocado roll, as well as their fancier rolls. If you want to be particularly decadent, Asia Cuisine's fried sushi rolls are delicious!
Despite the name Asia Cuisine is really a Korean Restaurant that serves Korean inspired takes on Japanese and Chinese.  Compared to other Korean restaurants Asia Cuisine has more 'home-style' food, which I generally prefer.  It may also, and somewhat oddly, have the best sushi in town (which is really more of a statement about the competition). The bulgogi is much greasier than typical, but it works.  The lunch specials are also a good deal.  Generally most things on this menu will be tasty, but not much really stands out as amazing.
Went in on April 9th after walking around Ithaca Commons looking for a place to eat. After a five minute wait, we managed to find a table for three. The tables are spaced very close together and servers may have to lean over to serve the other tables. The tuna roll was good but not great but the Sesame chicken was excellent. You can order it with any amount of spice with 1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest. Overall a good, solid dinner. Service was great.
My go-to restaurant in Ithaca. Everything here - the food, the room, the service - is friendly, homey, fresh, and unpretentious. The 4 types of homemade kim chi served with every Korean dish are a treat. I love the room, with its big old-fashioned windows and exposed brick, and service is genuinely friendly and welcoming. I don't usually care about stuff like that, but it's definitely one of the things that makes this place so inviting. I always order from the Korean menu (maybe occasionally Chinese, but I've never ordered sushi here - as a coastal person, sushi in Ithaca just feels wrong to me.) My favorite dish by far is the dolsot bibimbap. Let it sizzle to put a crunch on the rice, sauce it up, add a little salt (everything here is undersalted), and let the comfort-food glow sink in. There are other good dishes too. I really like the pork stir fried with kim chi, and the deep-fried chicken is good too. But I've also had some dishes I didn't care for. There's a dish that includes hotdogs, baloney, and dried ramen noodles all boiled in a kimchi broth - I'm sure it's a down-home favorite that will bring back sentimental memories for some (like the "spam sushi" a Japanese-American friend sometimes talks about), but it didn't work for me. There are also some noodles in black sauce that I didn't love. Sorry not to give the Korean names!
I could feel the MSG in their stew :( But their mapo tofu was amazing.
one of the best asian foods in Ithaca. Loooooovveeee the korean soups there, although the Spicy Salmon rolls are also one of my favorites. The only thing I have to complain about is the prices, some items (especially the Chinese Korean dishes) are so expensive for no good reason, around 20 dollars for beef in sweet sauce? You can get the same thing at Apollos for like 8 bucks.
Delicious food, quality ingredients & interesting options. Great prices too. It's a nice place for a quick, fairly healthy dinner.
I haven't been to Asian Cuisine in awhile but I was looking forward to ordering a take out meal today. I'm very disappointed. I paid $13 for a styrofoam container with not even a bunch of bean sprouts and a fried egg thrown on top. I don't eat much but this isn't enough to feed a bird! I feel like I got ripped off
OMG, so this place was so tastey I felt compelled to write my first review ever. I really enjoyed the food I got and the service was really fast and very friendly! I ordered the Bibimbap and it was absolutely delicious. I'm definitely going to have to go there again! I have been craving this particular meal and I was starving and I definitely left very satisfied. The food must have come in about 5, maybe 6 minutes which I was very impressed by. The beef was very flavorful and I really have no complaints other than next time I might ask for a little extra meat. Also, the prices are fairly reasonable. A little expensive but worth it in my opinion. (The meal was $9.99) Good portions, very filling, and very satisfying!
The Jackson Pollock of Asian food. Delivers a truly unique experience with its eclectic array of food to stuff your face with.  This was what Willis was talking about.
This place is a pretty cozy/homey restaurant with a menu featuring Chines, Japanese, and Korean food.  I've only ever ordered from the Korean dishes, so I don't know about the Chinese and Japanese items on the menu, but this place has pretty good and has relatively authentic Korean food (for Ithaca).  Still, fortunately for vegetarians, unlike a traditional Korean restaurants it seems like they have lots of veggie/tofu options/substitutions for their dishes.  When I last went a few days ago, I also liked that they served hot Korean corn tea instead of the usual ice water that comes out at the beginning of a meal.
For reliably good vegetarian-friendly Asian food in Ithaca, Asia Cuisine is near the top of my list.  Although  there are ample decent, well-priced Asian restaurants in within a 5 minute drive in any direction, I keep going back to A.C. for the simple, unpretentious ambiance. The corner spot is cozy and warm in the evening, bright and open during the day -- and for my menu favorites: avocado salad is impeccable -- fresh and light over seaweed with a light sweet/sour carrot-based dressing. Vegetable bibimbop with tofu - a perfectly satisfying bowl of lightly cooked spinach, sprouts, carrots and (duh) tofu, beneath a fried egg. Stir in some rice,  add-you some sriracha..and you are within 15 minutes Self-Actualized. Try the sweet potato roll and marvel at the composition of the sauce drizzled over top. (Notes of cinnamon?). The mapo tofu is pretty close to perfection,  crunchy from the water chestnuts, silky from the tofu and just the right degree of spicy, sweet, savory.  I like my  noodles like I like my men:  firm, kinky and homemade. In  veggie J-Jan Bang (? --item V-6) the noodles are addictive enough that you continue to try to make peace with the burn of the spicy reddish broth, even as you signal for more water. I only ordered the vegetable udon once (tip!) and other noodle-based dishes can be so-so. Also, choose the dduck bodu (? item A-7), intriguingly glutenous cylinders of rice cake in a spicy 'gravy' over the over-priced, rather disappointing veggie pajum, if you are okay with heat and texture.  There is corn tea on tap for the kids and the caffeine-sensitive and a couple decent beers and sakes for the over-21 crowd. A.C. is kid- friendly. The service is always sweet and attentive.
I ordered the spicy seafood soup and ojingo bokum.  I obviously need to evaluate this in its proper context; Ithaca is not K-town in Los Angeles.  The soup was a pleasant surprise, it was a combination of the red chili paste with the Korean miso/ soy bean paste, and several seafood goodies thrown in.  It's not something I'd order again but because it was a first, my taste buds were amused.  The ojingo bokum, aka spicy squid bbq, was okay, not bad, but nothing amazing.  I thought there were too much onions and carrots, but digging past them to the bottom paid off, eureka, found them squiddies...the flavoring almost reminded me of what they use for dukboki (rice cake appetizer).  There was definitely more sugar in it than normal, but as mentioned by another reviewer, some folks might like that.  All is all, it was a solid meal for what I needed- spicy and hot.  The food was good enough to warrant a return visit!
Great delicious Korean and Chinese food here.  Fast, delicious, and a huge selection to choose from.  The eggplant with garlic sauce was heavenly, and the fried rice dishes were delicious.  The staff were friendly and helpful, and the food came out fast.
Food is exceptional and there is a large variety of options.  Service is good, but seating is limited.  Price is fairly good for the food.  This restaurant has the absolute best hot and sour soup I've ever tasted.
Best sushi in Ithaca!!  Smaller restaurant but it seems people come, eat, and go at a variety of times during the day and evening so I have rarely found it too crowded to get a table.  Fresh still warm rice is used to make their sushi and everything is always fresh and made to order.  They happily comply with any food allergies or requests. They offer many different kinds of sushi, plus chinese, japanese, and korean dishes.  The service is always quick and friendly.  The complimentary corn tea is wonderful too.
Mhmm, excellent sushi and korean.  My favorite place to go in Ithaca.  The New York Roll (salmon, tuna, apple) is so simple and yet so good.  The prices here are really good!  Can get crowded and wait staff seems overwhelmed sometimes.  I highly recommend this restaurant.
Went here for a late lunch with my husband and it was amazing! We had the sashimi salad, rockland roll, and special soup with squid, shrimp, and mussels. All were delicious and at a great price. We also received our food very quickly and service was great. I highly recommend!
No longer as good as remember it. I really don't like the fact that they use canned mushrooms in their stir fries. Its still decent asian food, but I definitely prefer "Spicy Asian" for Chinese and the Korean dishes are on par with the other Korean restaurants, maybe slightly better.
I've had several very tasty meals here. They've got a ton of vegetarian and vegan options. Definitely try it out.
I don't know how this place does it. Deal with the devil? Evil robots? Gnomes? I have never experienced faster service in my life. A friend and I ordered some Korean dishes for dinner. They came out of the kitchen in under 4 minutes, and were surprisingly good.
This is some of the best (read: only edible) Asian food in Ithaca outside of the farmer's market.  Don't let the vague name scare you - it's Japanese and Korean food.  Service is mixed, but pretty responsive.  The first time I came they left the tofu out of my tofu and broccoli, but it was a special request anyway.  The vegetable sushi is good, especially the sweet potato roll.  Bibim bop was also very good, with excellent fresh vegetables and good sauces (though this is the only place I've ever had it).
Asia Cuisine.  Exactly what the name says is exactly what they offer.  They offer Japanese, Chinese, and Korean platters.  I've eaten their twice, once for lunch, once for dinner.  I've taken out countless times.  It's kind of small (seats maybe 30 people) but the service is great, the food is great, it's situated right on one of the main streets that runs through Ithaca.
I was up from nyc visiting ithaca this weekend, and was lucky enough to enjoy a meal at this wonderful establishment.  This is a great place to order a ton of stuff between a few friends and split it all up.  My three companions and I did just this.  We dabbled into Chinese, Korean, and Japanese dishes, all were spot-on.  The four of us were taken on an asian food odyssey of epic proportions....it left us sooo pleasantly full and only cost us about twenty-five duckets apiece.   Highlights include: Thompkins Roll, beef bibimbop, kimchi + noodle stew, and the chicken in light brown sauce.  Everything comes out of the kitchen very rapidly, as the cooks complete it, & in no particular order.  This was great because we were all real hungry, but I guess it can be troublesome if you're not prepared for it.   I am a frequent diner in chinatown and koreatown.....and this place gets my stamp of approval.  Ithaca residents, enjoy this gem of a restaurant- I will be missing it.
Asia Cuisine is not very authentic nor is it very good. The Korean options are the better bet when compared to the Japanese. The staff was also not very knowledgeable about what they have to offer and it was frustrating when trying to determine the contents of some of the sushi rolls. Overall, I would not recommend coming here unless you were absolutely desperate for some semblance of asian food.
Must've been an off night-service was slow. I got the hwe dup bap, but it had a gamey bit of mystery seafood.
A friend said this was the best sushi in town, I can see why. Great service and a quiet little place. Love it! The sushi and dumplings were both very good, priced well, and will definitely return next time I am in town.
Try the hot and sour soup.  Sooooooo tasty.
The SESAME CHICKEN  is AMAZING!!!! I only eat that there and go there every time I visit Ithaca. My friend even enjoyed the sesame tofu. This review is purely off the sesame chicken.
This place is kind of a dive, but it seems you can't find better Korean food anywhere in this part of NY!   In fact, the food here ranks up there as some of the best I've had.  The only downside is they only gave us 4 small banchan whereas other restaurants are much more generous, but it really didn't detract from the experience at all.  The bimibap was very tasty, as was the pork and kimchi stew.  My partner ordered a delectable glass noodle dish, and bulgogi which had the perfect amount of sweetness.  The staff seemed very friendly and helpful.  The amount of seating is limited, but we went on a Saturday night and had no problem getting a seat.  Definitely a place I'd recommend to someone who loves Korean food!
This place has great options, but I usually go for the kimchi pork.  It's difficult to have somebody else at the table order this dish when you could have, and should have done the same thing yourself.
Enjoy this place A LOT. I like the sushi but I've had better. Seaweed salad is the best in Ithaca that I've had.The Korean dishes are delicious. Pretty much anything with Kimchi is worth getting like the Kimchi Bokum. I enjoy the tea that they give you on the table and the authentic Korean condiments you get with your meal. Staff is friendly and the food comes quickly out of the kitchen. The bento boxes and lunch specials are a seriously good deal if money is a concern. The place is really small so it's best for parties of 4 or less, OR call for takeout which I do all the time.
Seriously amazing sushi!!!  They use warm rice and make everything fresh to order -- delicious.  They have a wonderful selection of raw / sushi dishes and cooked Korean and Japanese dishes, which keeps everyone happy! The staff will kindly make adjustments (like leaving off certain sauces, etc) to your order if you ask.  It can get a bit crowded in there, and it is a bit awkward if you are waiting for a table as there is little room to stand.  However, the service is quick and friendly.
Went in tonight looking for some good food. Not bad, miso soup was good, salad dressing was eh at best. Teriyaki salmon lacked flavor and did not come with enough sauce. Sushi was okay. Server was nice and knowledgeable. Service was a little slow however. Overall 3.5, rounds down.
As a souther California native and Korean-American, Asia Cuisine is the best place in Ithaca to get your Korean style Chinese food fix.  I recommend their noodle dishes (which they can make vegetarian).  Their sushi is also not bad, and more reasonably priced than the Korean run Japanese place across the street.  I'm a big fan of their seaweed salad as well.  Lastly, I have to say that the standard Korean dishes, especially the jigaes, are decent, but not great.
The sushi and tempura were good considering the price and the rural location of the restaurant. Only critique is that sauce for the unagi don and agedashi tofu is too sweet, which may taste good for some, but I would not consider it the traditional Japanese taste.

It's really cool when you know people in high places. Well, sorta. This one came highly recommended and I would not hesitate to come here again. This is standard Chinese cuisine but they also offer others such as sushi and Japanese as well as Korean. I have to tell you that this is quite possibly the best Bi bim bap I have ever had. The only thing I can't figure out is why it's spelled differently everywhere you go. What's up with that? Anyway, there is a cold and hot version off this dish. I prefer the cold with no rice. It comes with your choice of either white or brown. It's a variety of veggies including mushrooms and marinated mung bean sprouts. It's good. It's healthy.
I originally was going to give this place 3 stars. Please read if you would like to be money savvy. We ordered: Finger lakes roll: supposedly five fishes, but it had three, and it is fried. It was okay. 11.50 Spider roll: it's tempura shrimp, not the usually soft crab, with eel sauce. Overall, interesting but wouldn't go for it with eel sauce. 10 Bim bop chicken: roommate liked it, said it taste like cinnamon. Basically stir fry chicken with carrots and egg. Not sure price. Kimchi jjigae: close enough jjigae, over cooked medium firm tofu, over cooked kimchi and a spicy water down soup. 9 Here's a few pointers: 1) it was our first time at this restaurant and My roommate and I were in it for the sushi. I know I can't expect sushi here to be five star taste like Southern California, but did every sushi have to have eel sauce that tasted like cinnamon? 2) we ordered a second time and of course it came with separate checks for a second round order, that's fine. But...does the stir fry bim bop and kimchi jjigae pork also have to taste like cinnamon? Was cinnamon your go to spice or did you use cinnamon flavored Ajax to wash your cookware? 3) service wise wasn't great,  my roommate had to ask for water twice, ask for the check a few times, and plus we weren't even paid attention to until we moved to the back of the restaurant near their kitchen. 4) we had a total of 43.09 and I had forgotten we were low on cash since we were out exploring ithaca all week. We gave the lady 43.14, she comes back with a nickel and said "I wasn't sure why you paid over the amount, were you expecting something back?" Then she stood there for 2 minutes staring at us basically implying for tip. 5) we were almost out of cash, I felt bad and was thinking of coming back and over tipping the next time when I had restocked my cash. We gave up the rest of our wallets which came out to be 3 dollars. Then the lady comes back and have the audacity to say "uuuaaahm that is OK, but you know tip is 15%." Sorry, but in America, your tip is rated by your service, not the amount you are privileged to. I cannot relate to your plight if you order me to pay 15% tip to you and critique my spending skills. Honey, money doesn't grow on trees, I've been in blue collar job before and you've got to work it. I was thinking this was my go to place for a quick warm noodle soup in the future, and to pay up for the accidental under tipping, but sorry, I'm not coming back here again if I'm obligated to pull money out of trees.
General Tao or Sesame chicken is what we meant to order but we ended up with Mapo Tofu and pork instead. We were peeved, it was our error, we wrote the number down wrong but.....surprisingly.....it was the best Mapo Tofu I've ever put in my mouth hole. When I've had it in the past the tofu was very soft and the pork was ground and it was way too soupy. This tofu was decently sized and the pork was sliced thinly. Garlic eggplant was ok, I prefer a slimy sauteed eggplant, like giant slugs. MMMMM garlic slug plants. This was a drier fry. Vegetable pancake was delicious, there were a variety of veggies in there. Tofu Bibimbap was a bag call on my part for take out. Part of the love of a good dish is the sear the rice gets in the hot hot bowl. This was missing in cardboard although the (I thought more that usual) variety of items were nicely arranged. I did not care for the sushi, the rolls were a little looser than I expected, one oddly smushed and some bites unevenly filled, also not too flavorful. Spicy tuna roll and Wasabi Tobiko roll were tried. Meager wasabi without a kick unfortunately.
Food portions are small and the place can be quite crowded on Friday/Saturday evenings leading to long service times. Don't mistake crowds for quality though, I'd chalk this up to the location in the Commons. If you really want Korean food I would suggest venturing up to Collegetown and trying Four Seasons or Koko's instead. When a restaurant can't make up its mind on whether it's Chinese/Japanese/Korean the results are usually not promising.
I love this place.  For lunch I recommend the bento box with bulgogi.  For dinner I love the chinese style dishes, the hot korean dishes, and all the sushi.  I was there about 2 weeks ago and asked for a recommendation of a veggie roll, and it turns out the special vegetable roll (made with a mix of veggies) is insanely good.
We went here when we were looking at colleges last year. Forgot to write a review but our experience was really good that we still remember it a year later. They have the best General Tso's chicken! Just perfect. My bibimbap was good but I had a better one in NY. My daughter got a noodle dish which was very good. My husband had a beef dish (which he said goes very well with my bibimbap) and my daughter got shrimp tempura which are ok. I will go back just for the general Tso's chicken, and we are 9 hrs away!
Menu is varied & interesting (but take a picture as they don't have paper menus to take home with you!). Tofu bokum w/broccoli was good, sushi was fresh. They have several spice options on request. Portions are generous. Many options for vegetarians! Entrées served w/fish cake and spicy kimchi. Prices are reasonable but not cheap, server was personable & relatively attentive. Meal prep was a bit slow & came out in stages. Check/to go box was on the slow side.
This place has really good Jia Jiang mian! This is probably one of the best Chinese/Korean places in Ithaca. I've been here with both my friends and my parents and everything they ordered seemed both authentic and delicious. We've had the Jia Jiang mian, Jap Chae, Sam sung jam bong (Korean spicy soup with seafood and noodles). The only concern I have about this place is that seating takes forever. There are only small tables and sometimes you will have to wait if you come in a big group. The servers are friendly but it seems they are habitually understaffed. The last time I went only one lady was working so the service was kind of slow. Overall I really enjoy coming to this place. I really usually don't like Asian fusion places but this seems to be only fusion between Chinese and Korean which isn't too bad. The bento boxes seem really good and the sushi looks fresh as well. Guess I'll have to try them when I go back.
Outstanding food. At first I was not sure about the concept of Japanese, Korean and Chinese food in a single place. In the past it was always a recipe for bad food. But this place severs great food for all three cuisines.      The spicy sashimi, bulgugi, dosam bimba bamp and the sesame chicken were all served fresh and very tasteful. Highly recommended.
Asia Cuisine is easily my favorite restaurant in Ithaca--and that's saying a lot since the market is SO over-saturated with Asian food. Usually when I hear of a place that does Tha, and Japanese, and Korean all together my first thought is "run! fast!" but this place rocks it. Their sushi is out of this world--always fresh, nice presentation, and basically the best it gets. My girlfriend usually gets their bento boxes for dinner and from what I've nibbled off her plate, it seemed very good. (chicken terriyaki) The service there is also great--servers are friendly, always attentive even when its busy (it usually is--that should tell you something!)
A great selection of Asian foods:  Chinese, Cantonese, Korean and Japanese. All are served hot to table. Service is a bit scattered, but quick in comparison to others in this category. The kim chee jigae soup is a sure hangover cure if you're in the market for such.
I finally found a place in Ithaca that i wouldn't hesitate to give a 4 rating. Ithaca keeps disappointing me with its food and i actually started feeling disappointed before we tried this out. I was always skeptical about an "Asian fusion" place, so when my friend recommended, I didn't even bother to try. Tonight my husband and I we decided to give it a shot and we were glad we chose this one over Chiptole. We were pleasantly surprised. My husband ordered the bibim bop and I ordered the balgogi bento box. Bibim bop didn't wow me but the bento box was really good. The brown rice was mixed with purple stickly rice, which was the first time I've ever seen this. It just tasted healthy and awesomely awesome. Balgogi isn't the best i had, but for a place like Ithaca I'm really pleased with the quality already. It also comes with the pan fried rice noodle which just tastes like Chinese fried noodle and I loved it. Tempura and california roll were ok. I wasn't a big fan of it and my hubby had to finish it for me. It's a bit on the pricy side. Your tummy might thank you but your wallet won't. Overall a great experience. We will come back more often definitely.
This is my favorite restaurant in Ithaca. I wish some of the higher-end places were as consistent and delicious, but they just can't measure up. I'm always happy to spend a special occasion dinner at Asia Cuisine and go somewhere more upscale for drinks and dessert. Recommended dishes: vegetable pajun, chicken bokum, jae yuk gui, fried tofu, and the ridiculous/awesome Cortland Roll.
Ordered the Tioga roll, jja jjang myun, and tang soo yuk. Tioga roll: crispy, savory, and tangy. I would order this again. The plate was the length of my wrist to my elbow Jja jjang myun: on par with what i've ordered in flushing. Tang soo yuk: would definitely recommend that y'all order. Crunchy and just the right amount of sweetness. Pros: waiters/waitresses were very friendly and helpful. Food came put relatively quickly as well. Cons: ?
Went back for lunch for some General Chicken and this place is still as good as it was a year ago. I don't know how they do it but the consistency of the food here is amazing. Keep on keeping on! Love coming here!
Whenever told that a restaurant does Chinese, Korean, and Japanese food all in one kitchen, I tend to be skeptical of its quality. I was especially skeptical going into one in Ithaca, given that most Asian food in Ithaca is already subpar. But I was surprised when I actually tried this place. They do a lot of basic things from a variety of cuisines so if you're ever feeling like getting Asian food this would be a decent spot. For lunch specials they have stuff like bento boxes (teriyaki, kalbi, bulgogi, etc.), sushi combos, Korean dishes like bibimbop and tofu stew. I did notice that they charge extra for soup though (e.g. miso) which is kinda weird since most places include it with the entree. I went for the zhajiangmian/jajangmyun since I haven't had that in a while. It came in a pretty big bowl but it's only filled about halfway. I liked that it had plenty of sauce though, and the noodle never felt dry. There were plenty of vegetables of beef chunks mixed into it too. Seemed like a good balance of everything. Service here is rather slow, but the staff is really nice. Expect prices to be just over $10 for lunch (I paid $12 including tip for what I had), which is pretty comparable to a lot of other Asian places. The place is pretty small, and even for lunch in the middle of the week it felt pretty cramped when only half the tables were taken. But overall it should be a nice place to try if you ever want to get Asian food outside of Collegetown.
Did sushi takeout. Poor customer service on the phone. Arrived on time to pick up order. Had to wait almost 20 minutes at the cash register, standing, in the way of several people. They seemed too short-staffed. Got home and opened the bag. One item was wrong (seaweed salad was given as an iceberg lettuce salad), another was dinky (miso soup was about 4 ounces), and the sushi rolls were below average in quality. Perhaps their Korean fare is better, but I can't overlook the poor QA and customer service. Not going back.
Go to ithaca spot for Asian Korean food. It's always good ad the service is always friendly. I love the Korean sushi combo options. The jop chai is a bit oily but they are happy to make it with less oil. It's great value, and always satisfying. It's not the best sushi or Korean I've had but for ithaca it is! This is one my favorite restaurants in town.  Lunch is a great deal too! Love the hot and sour soup!
I was plesantly surprised...we all ordered the bibenbop and loved it. The vegetables were perfectly cut and cooked with a really nice flavor. The bulgogi meat was so delicious and of good quality. The rice was separate in a different bowl (versus just on the bottom)...which was great! You can eat however little or much rice you want. I haven't had it like this before but, really really liked it.  One of my sons should have just gotten the bulgogi since he is not a veggie eater. But I scored since that meant we took his leftovers with us (the veggies) and I got to eat them the next day. Yum! I hope we end up coming back to Ithaca so I can try some of their other dishes.
I came in with my family and we were seated immediately. The service was very quick and the waitress was friendly. It is a small restaurant but I enjoyed the vibe. The appetizer was shrimp dumplings for $4.50 and they were very good. The general chicken was some of the best ive ever had. For 3 people it came to $65 dollars but we ordered quite a bit of food. It was a great restaurant.
The owners of Asia Cuisine are Korean and they serve the best Korean dishes in Ithaca. They definitely serve some of the tastiest kimchi I've ever had. Their sesame chicken is out of this world, as well as the Tang Soo Yook (as enjoyed in my meat-eating days). I highly recommend those entrees, as well as Galbi. There are plenty of vegetarian options on the menu as well. However, the Yaki Soba or any dish with Garic Sauce (Chicken with Garlic Sauce) aren't the most exciting dishes to get. Recommended appetizers: seaweed salad or avocado salad The service may not always be the best, but the food was always top notch when I dined here.
Went here for a late lunch with my husband and it was amazing! We had the sashimi salad, rockland roll, and special soup with squid, shrimp, and mussels. All were delicious and at a great price. We also received our food very quickly and service was great. I highly recommend!
I've been here a few times and I have to say that I'm impressed. I really love Korean food and this probably has the best Korean food in this area. Not only do they have good Korean food, but they also serve sushi, Chinese food, and Japanese food.  Usually I'm afraid of Asian restaurants that serve different types of asian cuisine. It usually means they are a "jack of all trades., master of none", but that wasn't the case here, at least with the Korean food. I think their Korean food is really good, their Chinese food is okay, and I'm not sure about their Japanese. If you are looking for Korean food then by all means come here. If you are looking for Japanese or Chinese then you might find that this place suites your needs or you might try looking elsewhere.
No longer as good as remember it. I really don't like the fact that they use canned mushrooms in their stir fries. Its still decent asian food, but I definitely prefer "Spicy Asian" for Chinese and the Korean dishes are on par with the other Korean restaurants, maybe slightly better.
This place has unbelievably delicious food!   I just wanted to start off by saying the 1st thought in my mind when Asia Cuisine is mentioned.  The restaurant itself is an odd space. The door is situated in such a way that, when it's cold outside, a very bitter draft slices right through the middle of the entire restaurant.  Better hope for a seat against the wall on those days.  The seating is also very cramped.  I always call it the "Carnegie Deli of Asian food". When it is busy (which it usually is) it is not uncommon to be nearly elbow to elbow with other patrons.   So far this review doesn't sound promising, but you quickly forget your discomfort, and annoyance when the food starts to come.  It is usually pretty quick to arrive, and my god is it good?!  I have had several dishes here, but I always come for the deep-fried sushi rolls.  They are the single most exquisitely delicious food item that has ever entered my mouth.   They have a wide selection of creative rolls, and many kinds of other meat, vegetable, and noodle dishes too.  It is a really full menu, and everyone should be able to find something good.  This isn't an exorbitantly priced place, but it's really easy to spend a lot here.  Damn, I wish I could go there now.
I've had several very tasty meals here. They've got a ton of vegetarian and vegan options. Definitely try it out.
After everything I'd read about this place - on yelp, in the Ithaca Times, on other websites - I was expecting to be blown away.  Instead, I barely felt a breeze. I went for lunch - service was fast and friendly, and the menu is extensive.  There's something for carnivores and vegetarians alike, and if you like sushi, there are plenty of decently sized rolls.  If you don't like sushi, there are a number of other Kroean and Chinese dishes to choose between.  The lunch menu is very reasonably priced. I ordered a seafood soup that was listed on the menu as "very spicy" and I confirmed with the waitress that I like spicy things.  I was expecting a dish that would set my hair on fire - but what I got was only mildly more spicy than toast.  It wasn't bad per se, it just wasn't exactly what I was expecting. Meh. It's okay.  I'd go back and try something else - and if I do, I'll be sure to update my review.
I don't know how this place does it. Deal with the devil? Evil robots? Gnomes? I have never experienced faster service in my life. A friend and I ordered some Korean dishes for dinner. They came out of the kitchen in under 4 minutes, and were surprisingly good.
One of my favorite places to eat in Ithaca. Get the Sesame Chicken! Its filling, sweet and savory, and comes with rice. The wait can be long at times but its well worth it.
This is some of the best (read: only edible) Asian food in Ithaca outside of the farmer's market.  Don't let the vague name scare you - it's Japanese and Korean food.  Service is mixed, but pretty responsive.  The first time I came they left the tofu out of my tofu and broccoli, but it was a special request anyway.  The vegetable sushi is good, especially the sweet potato roll.  Bibim bop was also very good, with excellent fresh vegetables and good sauces (though this is the only place I've ever had it).
Asia Cuisine.  Exactly what the name says is exactly what they offer.  They offer Japanese, Chinese, and Korean platters.  I've eaten their twice, once for lunch, once for dinner.  I've taken out countless times.  It's kind of small (seats maybe 30 people) but the service is great, the food is great, it's situated right on one of the main streets that runs through Ithaca.
Pros: I have eaten here many times now and have loved the food every single time. Im not a fan of the sushi here but a fan of everything else :D Con: Sat night is not a good time to eat here because they might forget about your table after seating you. That's the only bad experience I have had here.
I was up from nyc visiting ithaca this weekend, and was lucky enough to enjoy a meal at this wonderful establishment.  This is a great place to order a ton of stuff between a few friends and split it all up.  My three companions and I did just this.  We dabbled into Chinese, Korean, and Japanese dishes, all were spot-on.  The four of us were taken on an asian food odyssey of epic proportions....it left us sooo pleasantly full and only cost us about twenty-five duckets apiece.   Highlights include: Thompkins Roll, beef bibimbop, kimchi + noodle stew, and the chicken in light brown sauce.  Everything comes out of the kitchen very rapidly, as the cooks complete it, & in no particular order.  This was great because we were all real hungry, but I guess it can be troublesome if you're not prepared for it.   I am a frequent diner in chinatown and koreatown.....and this place gets my stamp of approval.  Ithaca residents, enjoy this gem of a restaurant- I will be missing it.
The sushi is ok, but for central New York standards it's pretty good.  I've gone here with those that are all "This isn't big city sushi" and refuse to eat there again, but if you can get past that the nearest "big" city is 4 hours away, it's good sushi compared to the rest of whats around. The service on the other hand is usually pretty slow.  It's a small restaurant and there isn't anything special to the decor to the place. I recommend the golden roll or the aurora roll.  Those are pretty tasty.
Asia Cuisine is not very authentic nor is it very good. The Korean options are the better bet when compared to the Japanese. The staff was also not very knowledgeable about what they have to offer and it was frustrating when trying to determine the contents of some of the sushi rolls. Overall, I would not recommend coming here unless you were absolutely desperate for some semblance of asian food.
Good food but terrible service. I would recommend Kahn poong ki and go chu jahp chae.
Must've been an off night-service was slow. I got the hwe dup bap, but it had a gamey bit of mystery seafood.
If you know what to order, Asia Cuisine is one of the better restaurants around. For consistently above-average food, stick to their Korean dishes (their Kimchi Jei Yook Bokum is OUTSTANDING - spicy pork with kimchi and tofu) and/or their Japanese noodles. The sushi is ok, considering how landlocked Ithaca is, but it'll disappoint hardcore sushi lovers. The non-fish sushi is great, particularly the sweet potato roll. It's a fantastic blend of creamy/savory deep-fried sweet potato, with sticky rice and good wasabi. Mmmmm. Don't f*** with the Chinese food here though, it's pretty poor.
A friend said this was the best sushi in town, I can see why. Great service and a quiet little place. Love it! The sushi and dumplings were both very good, priced well, and will definitely return next time I am in town.
When I was stay Ithaca, Hotel recommend me to Mahogany Grill. So I was heading out to the Mahogany Grill, but accidentally I found this Asian Cuisine on the way. I was just try to check out what kind of menu they have, but I ended up eating in there. They have a Korean and Korean style Chinese food, and taste was not too bad. But some some food was real spicy so be-careful about it. If you are going to staying near Cornell University and craving for Asian food you got the spot.
Try the hot and sour soup.  Sooooooo tasty.
The SESAME CHICKEN  is AMAZING!!!! I only eat that there and go there every time I visit Ithaca. My friend even enjoyed the sesame tofu. This review is purely off the sesame chicken.
This eatery has poor, poor customer service.  My order was forgotten while my friends happily gorged. Two couples seated after I visited the restaurant were given their food before my own. I was finally fed up with waiting and the repeated "just a minute" routine (after my friends were given their food 10 minutes ago), so I requested a cancellation on the food order.  I was given no apology or reconciliation.  They forgot my order and neglected to follow-up. I would recommend the slightly similar, better Korean BBQ place in Collegetown for excellent food AND service.
This place is kind of a dive, but it seems you can't find better Korean food anywhere in this part of NY!   In fact, the food here ranks up there as some of the best I've had.  The only downside is they only gave us 4 small banchan whereas other restaurants are much more generous, but it really didn't detract from the experience at all.  The bimibap was very tasty, as was the pork and kimchi stew.  My partner ordered a delectable glass noodle dish, and bulgogi which had the perfect amount of sweetness.  The staff seemed very friendly and helpful.  The amount of seating is limited, but we went on a Saturday night and had no problem getting a seat.  Definitely a place I'd recommend to someone who loves Korean food!
Love their menu because of the options but taste wise is eh. FIRST time I saw a female sushi chef!!! Impressed. Tofu Vegetable Jja Jang Myun - One word - DRY. The size is worth the price but not worth the taste. Deep fried vegetable roll - yum! First time having a deep fried roll. Except to chew a lot. I actually like it not fresh. Why? Less chewing and pieces stuck on your teeth. Vegetable roll - Regular veggie roll. Mapo Tofu - oily and how is this mapo tofu? It should be named oily firm tofu. Service - amazing. They gave me a vegetable roll on the house because I was plucking out all the fish roe on my deep fried vegetable roll (wasn't informed of it when I asked what was in it)
The Kimchi here is VERY good. My wife and I came here on a Friday night and was very surprised at how fast they got us our food. The sushi was good not great however I will definitely be coming here again.
This place has great options, but I usually go for the kimchi pork.  It's difficult to have somebody else at the table order this dish when you could have, and should have done the same thing yourself.
One of my favorite places in Ithaca.  The biminbap here is really good. I recommend getting it. I also like their sushi, but I wouldn't come here just to have that. The chinese style dishes were just okay. There can sometimes be a wait, but usually not too bad.
Bad soup. Bad sushi. Bad entrees. Bad service. I was excited to see a vegetarian rendition of mapo doufu, but it was just pure disappointment.
Enjoy this place A LOT. I like the sushi but I've had better. Seaweed salad is the best in Ithaca that I've had.The Korean dishes are delicious. Pretty much anything with Kimchi is worth getting like the Kimchi Bokum. I enjoy the tea that they give you on the table and the authentic Korean condiments you get with your meal. Staff is friendly and the food comes quickly out of the kitchen. The bento boxes and lunch specials are a seriously good deal if money is a concern. The place is really small so it's best for parties of 4 or less, OR call for takeout which I do all the time.
The food is pretty good! The dolsot bibimbop is a real winner for me and both the bulgogi and jei yook gui were very good. One of my friends got the General Chicken  and found it good. The kimchi is not to my personal taste but all the other condiments are quite nice. The sushi dishes are ok for a town that is hours from the ocean and I would say the gyoza also clock in around 'ok' but not great. That said, the service is unpredictable. Get great service one visit, get horrible service the next. It isn't a huge issue for me because I come here just to get bibimbop and maybe people-watch a little but if you want reliably good service or you're in a hurry to get somewhere maybe not the best choice for you.
Seriously amazing sushi!!!  They use warm rice and make everything fresh to order -- delicious.  They have a wonderful selection of raw / sushi dishes and cooked Korean and Japanese dishes, which keeps everyone happy! The staff will kindly make adjustments (like leaving off certain sauces, etc) to your order if you ask.  It can get a bit crowded in there, and it is a bit awkward if you are waiting for a table as there is little room to stand.  However, the service is quick and friendly.
Went in tonight looking for some good food. Not bad, miso soup was good, salad dressing was eh at best. Teriyaki salmon lacked flavor and did not come with enough sauce. Sushi was okay. Server was nice and knowledgeable. Service was a little slow however. Overall 3.5, rounds down.
Why is there a dearth of Japanese-Korean-Chinese awesome food places in Ithaca?! C'mon Cornell Univ. and Ithaca College is right there! ;p You're better off heading to the Ithaca Farmers' Market, now there'll be some good eats. Last time we went we made off with fresh hot apple cider, fresh hot apple donuts, and fond memories of the mouth-watering, mind-blowing souvlaki gyros. Addendum: The servers were polite even as the service was slow. The place neat, though mostly emptied of diners on a Saturday early afternoon. The sushi was passable but not remarkable. My friend enjoyed his seafood soup, though he remarked that it was noticeably oiler than Rochester's Sodam and Flushing's Hahm Ji Bach. But for the price, you do get what you pay for with fairly decent proportions. But ultimately, even the all-encompassing and promising "Asia Cuisine" appellation, did not inspire a second visit.
As a souther California native and Korean-American, Asia Cuisine is the best place in Ithaca to get your Korean style Chinese food fix.  I recommend their noodle dishes (which they can make vegetarian).  Their sushi is also not bad, and more reasonably priced than the Korean run Japanese place across the street.  I'm a big fan of their seaweed salad as well.  Lastly, I have to say that the standard Korean dishes, especially the jigaes, are decent, but not great.
