I've been shopping at Joettes on and off for years. It's a small, "blink and you'll miss it" costume jewelry boutique in Armory Square. I gave it 3 stars instead of 4 because there are some things in there that are kind of cheap looking and tacky, but stopping in is totally worth it because there are a few things in there that are absolutely AMAZING!!! As in the kind of stuff you can't normally find in Syracuse! Â It's definitely hit-or-miss but those hits have gotten me a ton of compliments so take the time to stop in. Happy Shopping!!!
This is a costume jewelry mega store! If you need some fun and unique pieces to spice up your jewelry chest this is the place to go. And if you're in need of some jewelry for your special wedding day there's a whole room in the back with necklaces, purses, and more.
