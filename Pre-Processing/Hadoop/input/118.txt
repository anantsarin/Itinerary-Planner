Solid little record shop dedicated to the next generation of vinyl aficionados. Not as deep a selection here as the Bop Shop or the Record Archive, but give 'em time. Definitely a "curated" store with a sharp focus towards less mainstream music. Following in the footsteps of the late, lamented South Wedge mainstay Analog Shock. Here's hoping Ross (and crew) make a solid go at this business. Well worth a stop over when you're visiting Rochester, Western New York's vinyl capitol.
The best record store in rochester! My friend and I were on tour and stopped in. Huge selection of punk and hardcore vinyl among other genres. Cool VHS selection too. Russ, the owner, was a super cool and friendly guy. Wish I lived closer!! Amazing spot
This is my new favorite record shop. Great selection and great prices.  I have seen some of their stuff priced significantly lower than some of the local competitors. Also today there was a super cute furry guinea pig to say hello to. This place has become my weekly jam for vinyl.
The record store Rochester has been waiting for!! NeedleDrop has an amazing selection of vinyl that gets better everyday (how is that even possible). The owner and staff are knowledgeable, approachable and enhance the entire experience. I love that NeedleDrop is just a record store, selling records, turn tables and a few other MUSIC related items. I can never just buy one record here. Let's be honest, I have a problem and NeedleDrop is my fix. I should just sign over my paychecks to them and be done with it.
Best record shop in Rochester. Great selection of punk, metal, jazz, and everything else
Obscure B-Movie Soundtracks, Minimal Wave, and stuff I never knew I had to have?  NeedleDrop is on point.  The South Wedge has desperately needed a good rekkid shop since Analog Shock left nearly a decade ago.
