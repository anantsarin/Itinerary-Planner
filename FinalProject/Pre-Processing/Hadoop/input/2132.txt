I've been coming to La Scala for years starting with its old location, which to me had a much better feel about it that was located just about across the street but unfortunately burnt down. Though the food is good it's all rather ho-hum, even somewhat boring as far as taste, preparation and presentation are concerned. The menu and preparation are clearly dated with little having changed since the 1960's. Of course when you see the social security/medicare general age of the patrons you'll probably understand why little has changed. Worse yet, somebody got the silly idea to add LED lighting which, with its bluish glaring tones, is enough to even make a teenagers look aged well beyond their true years. What I do like about it is that it's clean, quiet, offers a good meal for the buck, albeit boing, along with friendly professional wait staff. I had the clams casino, prime rib and Caesar salad. The clams were good but the breading on top came out burnt which added a rather undesirable burnt charcoal taste. The prime rib was good, but somewhat thin with nothing exceptional about it. As for the Caesar, it was cut, not torn, but suitable enough.
Ate a lovely after church dinner today at La Scala.  Although the restaurant was very nice and the food delicious, the experience was diminished due to our waitress who had zero personality.  She barely spoke to us, never made eye contact and was generally unfriendly though she attended adequately to our needs.  Waitressing is not this girl's niche!
There is absolutely no way that I will be as thorough or as entertaining as Max N in his review, but I will say this:  La'scala is the best restaurant in Jamestown, bar none.  Whether this speaks to the lack of quality restaurants in Lucyville, or to the brilliance of the restaurant, I'm not certain, but the 70s-era ambience, Alice-like wait-staff and bountiful and diverse menu are comforting to me - and the fact that the quality of the food is fantastic just makes it all the better!   Love this place!
Don't let the drive scare you. LaScallas was hyped to me for 10 years. Ive laughed at how the portions and quality were described to me. Not any more. I'm happy to report it really does live up to its reputation. LaScala's is a very clean, very upscale place. What tremendous effort must go on here to be providing a consistant product all these years: thanks Chef Mike and staff. We entered the restaurant and i loved the gold, glass and gaudiness. I felt like a total gangster. Lets just get this out of the way: sunday  brunch is an amazing meal for the value. I think it opens at noon when they serve breakfast and dinner. On the right side of the room they offered breakfast: western scrambles, sausage, bacon, french toast. The left buffet had the dinner entrees: bacon wrapped stuffed pork loin, tortilla breaded cod, fantastic mashed potatoes, crab and asparagus 'Mac and cheese', which was penne pasta (very very well balanced flavors), and a sautéed veggie dish, which I thought was too peppery. The middle housed a nice simple salad bar- check out the house dressing. I've saved the prime rib station for its own paragraph. Cooked to perfection, the chef generously doled out a slice of Rib an inch thick onto my plate. Kids, this thing had its own zip code. I followed suit with other guests who drizzled the aus jus over top, and it was to die for. You could cut it with a baby rattle. Not only did I find quality and quantity but also value as the buffet worked out to around $15/person. I did two plates and it was nap time. Little did I know that a healthy slice of homemade cheesecake with my choice of toppings was yet to come. We eyed each other for a while, and then I gave in. Minus one star for the drive, but this place is spot on with the classic Sunday comfort food. We headed to Southern Tier brewery after to try some craft beers. Enjoy!
We had a reservation for 7 and at 7:30 we still were not seated. We decided to leave and go to Applebee's which was the best decision ever. Do not attend this institution.
FOOD: The food is very good. SERVICE: The wait staff isn't bad, but it took a while before we were seated and there was no line. CLEANINESS: The dinning area was clean. ATMOSPHERE: The look of the dinning area is a bit old look, but not bad.  It has a conservative Italian restaurant feel to the place. OTHER NOTES: They have the best lobster bisque I've ever had.  This place burned down in November 19, 2008 and I'm hoping that they'll reopen again because that lobster bisque is to die for.
Just returned from La Scala. Food and service were excellent. However, in today's (Aug. 24th) Pennysaver they had an ad with a highlighted line that clearly says "PRIME RIB only $9.95 on SAT. & SUN.!" The waitress announced the specials but didn't mention the prime rib. We asked her and she said "oh, that special is on Sunday only." Unfortunately, we hadn't brought the ad. So, even if the ad was a mistake, they need to honor something printed in the paper that arrives on the same day as the visit to the restaurant. Obviously now we will not tend to believe any advertising we see from La Scala.
Awesome prime rib
Just the pits. From the eerie setting in a cavernous former motel (think "The Shining") to the over-caffeinated, unfocused waitress to slow service to cheddar cheese chunks on the Italian antipasto platter, and overcooked and cloyingly sweet red sauce on the lasagna, this place has nothing I can recommend.
we have been customers of LaScala for many years.  always our go to restaurant.  we enjoy the food and the people very much.
