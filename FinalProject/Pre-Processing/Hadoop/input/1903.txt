In our quest for a new place to eat we stopped at Darby O'Gills. After ordering too much food we decided to bring home our wings. An order of 20 out of which we ate three, the waitress proceeded to tell us she couldn't give boxes for wings on wing night. So I paid an extra $7 for a box. The food we did eat, the fries were so loaded with grease they were disgusting. The pot stickers were frozen and fried, nasty. My wings included a wing tip. It took 5 minutes for anyone to acknowledge our presence and another ten for the waitress to come take our order. Then when we were done I placed all the dirty dishes on the end of the table, the empty cups, the silverware... and waited another 15 minutes for a check. Then 10 minutes for her to come get the card. Needless to say I never got a refill on my soda and the waitress didn't get a tip.

Bartender was rude, complained to us (the customers) that he was ''already losing money''. He then overcharged us by about 25%. When it was brought to his attention, he became more rude instead of apologizing. After inquiring about him overcharging, he then gave me incorrect change. I overheard him call me a SCUMBAG to another bartender for inquiring about him overcharging. After this, I certainly wasn't going to be buying any drinks from this bartender - Maybe thats why he was losing money? I didnt get his name, as he probably would have lied to me anyway. I inquired his name from the bouncer, who politely refused to tell me. He asked why I wanted to know, I told him that I felt he was rude, to which he replied ''he gets that a lot''. The bartender (manager / owner? - lord I hope not) was tall, probably 6'2, probably 280-300 pounds, white guy, around 30 years old. He was working on the main entrance side of the bar. I won't be back to Darby's.

If you're into crooked trivia, Darby O'GIlls is the ideal trivia night location. If you're into a game where intelligent, informed people match wits in a fair, equal environment, go somewhere else. Anywhere else. This place is a trivia butthole at which all good and hope vanishes. If you want to win at trivia night, wear a low-cut shirt and flirt with the trivia master. Eric will let anything slide for a glimpse of boob. Whip out your iPhones, look up answers that you couldn't possibly know because you boobed your way through high school and college also, and win an awesome gift certificate. Lift up your skirt and Eric will give you the entire answer sheet. But really, Eric. Really. When the Boob Twins whip out their iPhones when each question is asked, they're not "just texting". Are you so stupid that you don't know the difference, or were you just hoping for a quick HJ in the men's room? Put your boner away and do your job, and stop wasting everyone else's time. Sorry, Darby O'Gills. As long as you continue to allow this tool to keep on running trivia at your location, we won't be coming back, and we highly suggest that no one else waste their time either. Your food and drink might be edible and potable, but you've really let Stump Trivia F you in the A with this one.

It's hard to know what category to list Darby O'Gills under, because it's an Irish pub, so is it a bar or a restaurant? I think that depends on whether you're a student in Hyde Park, NY, or whether you're an outsider. I found myself in Hyde Park over the weekend. Around 11PM, the food options were scarce so my guide (a student in Hyde Park) suggested Darby's. The atmosphere was noisy, and it was full of students from the area schools. There was no waitstaff at that time of the night, and as the bar was full, the bartenders were running crazy to take orders. Every round of drinks took between 5-10 minutes to get the bartender's attention. We had to be aggressive about ordering food. However, when we got the food, it was tasty. The Irish Nachos are awesome - waffle fries with cheese, bacon, bacon, scallops, and more cheese. The waffle fries alone were tasty and well-seasoned, and the fixin's just made it even better. Two of us got wraps, which had good flavor - what more can you say about a wrap? The regular fries were also tasty. Extra points for a place having good food this late at night. The barstaff seems friendly enough and the food is good. However, it's jammed packed full of local students on the weekends and service is non-existent as a result. So if you're a local student and you want to meet and greet, head here. If you just happen to be in town for the weekend, head into Poughkeepsie for a chain restaurant and you might be better off.

Shamrocks and Guiness signs do not an Irish pub make.  This place wants to be an Irish pub, but it's not.  I was there today for lunch and got the burger which was pretty tasty.  Cooked well, though the bun was a little big, so the bread sort of overpowered the meat.  There was a bartender doing service for both the tables and the bar.   Service was slow.  There was a period of about 10-15 minutes where she was gone entirely.  People came in, looked around, and sat down,  My friend thought maybe she was using the toilet and it was that kind of emergency.  All I know is the service here is poor.   The food is good, which is why it gets an extra star.

Called to find out about them on Tues Jan 17th 2012 at 12-15PM. A girl answered with a "There's nobody here right now" then simply dropped the phone on top of my ear. Nice. Was looking for a venue for my group of rugby players and supporters to make Tuesday evenings our regular drinking spot, but now, will NEVER visit this palce. Someone needs to teach this kid some manners.

Darby's is great for what it is. Cold beers, clean lines and they have my favorite wings in the Hudson Valley. The bartenders are usually very good. I would not recommend going later in the evening when the college crowd comes in, it gets pretty crazy but that's my opinion.

Darby's is 90% of the time an awesome place for food/booze. I would not recommend going on Friday or Saturday evenings after 9pm, as the college scene crowds in. The Friday half price appetizer happy hour is an amazing deal and 2 appetizers cost less than 1 entree and equate more food. I have had very few negative experiences here short of an occasional airhead waitress. They claim to be getting a new menu soon but it has been in the works for some time. Items of excellence if available include the chicken claws, buffalo cheese dip bread bowl, and the Irish nachos.

We go here from time to time as options can be slim late at night. We had a great stretch here, when we had a friendly and competent young gentleman bartender (I think he was also a bouncer on the weekends). Since the service was always so poor with other bar staff, we tried to come in when he was working. I do not believe he is there any longer, sadly for us. Recent trips to Darby's have been frustrating, usually there are young girls working behind the bar and they seem to spend most of their time talking to each other or one or two of the customers. I would normally have no problem with it, as long as they keep an eye on the drinks. They do not. We wait and wait, and often end up leaving earlier than we would have liked just because it's annoying. I get that you bar owners have to hire young, attractive women...but good service is more important to anyone who wants to get their drink on within a reasonable amount of time. C'mon folks--get yourself a real bartender! The food is pretty decent for bar grub. Waffle fries, wings, nachos, burgers, etc. The prices are ok and they serve food late, though again...the service especially late at night is really dismal. They have some kind of a deal going on every night at the bar--two for one drinks, beer specials, etc. They have a trivia night which is fun to listen to...big TV's etc... The place is comfortable though not clean. It smells of beer rot. The pictures on the walls are very dusty, the bar is usually sticky, and glass windows/door need windexing. For some people this is no big deal. For me I always think "if no one cares enough to keep it clean where the customers can see it, then what must the kitchen look like?" We have become used to so many places like this where it appears no one is at the helm. Cleanliness should be a top priority. I will also echo was a couple of the other reviewers have already said--it's not really an Irish bar. It's just a strip mall college bar cloaked in the guise of an Irish bar, and it's so very different from the real thing. This all being said, we still go from time to time in the hopes that things will get better. Bottoms up!

Great appetizers (wings, mozzarella sticks), Irish Nachos are one of the best things I've ever eaten, and the drink specials...you must have the Electric Lemonade fishbowl with a few friends. Make sure you get some appetizers with the fishbowl so you and your friends can actually walk out of the bar.

Oh god.  I don't think I've ever had a drink that tasted so bad in my life.  I came here with a girlfriend for a drink, and made the mistake of ordering a fishbowl.  It sounded good with mango and rum, but it was just a nasty mixture of 99cents arizona, and dollar store rum which was further diluted with water and ice.  With tip this godforsaken bowl cost me $16.  Pretty much just threw my money out the window :(

College Dive bar. You will see Marist and culinary students alike pounding drinks and playing games with the miller lite girls. the specials are great on the nights that their is no cover. the bar outside is fun as well. Don't take yourself to seriously when your here, just relax and have fun.

Food was mediocre. The bar service is good if your only there for drinks. The bigger problem is when you sit at a booth expect to wait 45min to 1hr for someone just to give you a menu.

Hit or miss wings but the Irish nachos are to die for. Good bartender but table service can be slow depending on the night (understaffed?). Good place to stop for a few beers.

Guinness signs don't make a bar an Irish Pub. Lame.
