Everything about this theater venue is perfect except for the small, cramped seats. This theater is beautiful, old school, just a real treat to still have open and operating in WNY. I've seen live theater here and music concerts and the acoustics are great for either. On this particular occasion I was here seeing Manhattan Transfer, a jazz vocal quartet with piano accompaniment only. They were awesome and the sound quality of the theater really amplified the wonderful quality of the voices in concert! I love the old school popcorn machine and candy counter. They sell Chuckles... remember those?! You never wanted to eat the black one so you'd give it to your grandma?! HA! Classic. Also nice, is that the theater is located in the cute little downtown/main drag of North Tonawanda. There's a big parking lot behind the theater in case you can't find a spot on the main drag. Each time I've been here I've always been among a small pool of young people. Everyone else here is of senior citizen status. But we keep coming back because they offer unique shows and it's fun to scope out this little slice of history in WNY.
I've been to the Riviera on a few occasions and thoroughly enjoy this venue. It's beautiful and has ample seating, yet still feels intimate. We had seats that were super close to the stage for Manhattan Transfer on June 14th. Another thing I'm truly impressed with, and is so important to me in a concert/theater venue is the acoustics. The sound was great! We were too full from dinner to purchase concessions, but next time I come here I will be indulging in the theater popcorn (from their new, but classic) popcorn maker. They also had a lot of different candies available and sodas too. This theater is situated in the main strip in the heart of tonawanda. They have a great thing going, surrounded by restaurants, shops and bars. I would definitely go down there earlier and make it an evening spent in this area. Another major plus is close, on street parking. If you aren't able to get a street front spot, there is a huge parking area right across the street. I will be looking forward to more events at this place!
The Riviera does it all. This is a great place to see movies on occasion. They also do plays. My favorite thing to see here are the musical performances. They've had some great doo wop shows, the Temptations are coming later this year. Is an old, but beautiful Theater. I would recommend this to anyone it has the opportunity to see a show here, it really is a treat.
I'm so glad this place is getting more attention. There are operas, plays, movies, concerts etc and sitting there looking at the ornate ceiling, walls, chandeliers, lighting etc is a joy to behold. We're very lucky we have it.

****************************************UPDATE****­************************** I had tickets for the George Jones concert however the Possum passed away before the concert.  The Riviera was able to book Mel Tillis and Roy Clark to take his place and tickets would be honored from the Jones venue.  However there was a scheduling conflict and Roy Clark would not be able to attend.  The Riviera was proactive and immediately refunded the tickets.  This happened the day after they were informed of the scheduling conflict.  Great job.

Was here on Saturday for a show we took my son too, Max and Ruby's Birthday Surprise. The show itself was great but this Theatre is also pretty sweet. My second time in it over all. Was last here years ago to see Lewis Black. Nice old school feeling but still maintained well. Seating is comfortable and provides for good view of the stage from just about anywhere from what I could tell. Definitely worth checking out a show here for sure.

I'm writing this having been a patron and a performer at the Riviera Theatre. First of all, the inside is gorgeous, my cousin was in an I love NY commercial with a scene shot from the stage, The dressing rooms downstairs could definitely use a remodel, but they serve their purpose, and the older feel gives one a sense of history and nostalgia for the venue and its previous headliners. The staff and volunteers are very friendly, and clearly happy to do what they do. The stage crew manager couldn't be a nicer guy, he even let us adjust our own microphones saying "the audience paid to hear you, not my mix." While this sounds logical, I've met many many tech men who lose it if anyone so much as thought of touching a piece of equipment. Have I really waited two paragraphs to mention the Wurlitzer? This magnificent organ is the Riv's claim to fame, the sound is just awesome, and the organists like to have fun with it. I will never forget hearing a rendition of Lady Gaga's 'Bad Romance' organ style right before a show. Directors like to sit in front of it and marvel, not daring to begin playing without permission. I reserve the 5th star only because I expect a certain undefinable magic from old theatres, and while there are glimmers, it doesn't shine through. See a show at the Riviera Theatre. Just do it, you won't regret it. Especially if the Wurlitzer is featured.
