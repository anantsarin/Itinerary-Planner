I'll be back. This place is just my style. Small and pleasant. Great atmosphere, food is bat food, but from what I've seen, its good.

If you are in Jamestown, you have to hit this place up before even looking at anything else!!! You pull up to find only street parking.  It doesn't look like much, and I was wondering if this was a Yelp Punked episode.  I parked in one of the lots across from the corner.  No problems.   I was early (3:30PM) and thus was the only one here.  This place is tiny, so if you are planning on going during "prime times", I would call ahead for a reservation.  Yeah....he does reservations.  This place is tiny, but don't let it scare ya off.   Beer selection was good, and there is something for everyone.  The spirit selection houses some interesting selections (bacon flavored liquor).   Menu is concise, but very well planned.  He also has 4-5 specials every day, and they all sound amazing.  BUT make sure to you try the "Wild Fare"!!  Every Friday he switches the selection, and today it was Wild Boar Burger!!  It was delicious, and something that even this adventurous eater has never tried.  While in the bar, I overheard him orderingg Rocky Mountain Oysters for next week!! The place is surprisingly clean, until you talk to the guy who is running it!  He is chef that studied in Pittsburgh!!!   Go Stillers!!!  He has a passion for great food that is only eclipsed by his drive to bound over expectations.   I am a traveling salesman, and this was a treat.  If I only had one of these in every city I visit, I would be a happy guy!!   Well Done!!

My friend and I were traveling through Western New York, and discovered this restaurant through Yelp.  We were a little concerned because of the location and parking, but we went inside and were greeted warmly.  I had an Asiago Chicken Pizza, and my friend had the Beef Dip Sandwich with homemade potato chips.  Both were very good.  We really enjoyed our meals and speaking to the owner and his family.  A lot of fun.

We are not from the Jamestown area and were only looking for a quick bite to eat while on the road. This place was awesome. Don't judge it on its decor because it's a typical sports bar but the food was excellent. The loaded homemade potato chips were delicious and the house "Bigg Burger" was huge and very tasty. My friends had the elk burger and they all reported very positive reviews. I'm not in this area very often but I wish I was. Great place and friendly service!

Don't miss this place! Stellar and unique food (bacon wings, venison burgers) and an excellent beer selection. Great atmosphere, amazingly clean. The owner and chef (yes, he is a fantastically trained chef) really cares about your experience and it shows! This is so much more than your average neighborhood sports bar. Stay ahead of the curve and get to this place before it shows up on the Food Network!
