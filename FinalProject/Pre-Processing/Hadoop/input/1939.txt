Spring is finally here. Walked over the walkway today. The fresh wind from Hudson washed away the long winter blue.
Fantastic. Even post-foliage, the views are amazing, and the bridge is fascinating. There's just enough info posted to keep you intrigued as you walk along. Free parking on adjacent streets was easy to find. The signage pointing you to the entry in Poughkeepsie is not sufficient, so we wound up going up the stairs next to the restaurants on Washington Street. There are picnic tables there, some of them designed to accommodate wheelchairs. Nice. No vendors, no tourists (except us). Just the locals and their kids, dogs, bikes. Track teams from Marist kept things interesting. An older man took the time to regale us with stories about the bridge and its history. If you like the High Line in New York, you'll like the Walkway. Gives you faith in our ability to repurpose "eyesores" into public treasures.
This is so special an experience to be suspended over the magnificent Hudson river and take in the  views. One of the highlights of our too short trip to the lovely Hudson River Valley was ambling over and back on the walkway on a beautiful October morning. I say morning noting that it was remarkably serene when we arrived about 9:15-ish and got substantially more crowded by the time we left. So were we to do this again, we'd choose morning again. A tip we pass along. We started at the Poughkeepsie side and parking was plentiful. Monitors were checking too, to be sure folks paid their fee at the pay kiosk. The parking fee is only $5 in the lot. (Street parking free.) All kind of locals and tourists were  enjoying the morning together on the walkway. Note the photo of the guy on the unicycle who we hear, from the volunteers there, is a morning regular. What a fun show he was to watch! "Housekeeping items:" 1) Bathroom facilities are located on both the Poughkeepsie and Highlands side of the walkway - friends who used them said they were well maintained. 2) One food cart on the Pkeepsie side and several on the Highlands side for those who need a nosh or beverage.  3) Walking distance roughly one and a quarter miles each way. Our other highlights you ask? The FDR Site, Top Cottage, dinner at Red Devon in Bangall (thanks to Lydia L's "heads up"), a vist to the CIA, driving through the beautiful countryside that separates the charming small towns of the Hudson River Valley and the Rhinebeck Sunday morning Farmer's Market.
The Walkway Over the Hudson is a renovated Nineteenth Century railroad bridge, once an eyesore, that Poughkeepsie converted into a major attraction for local residents and tourists alike. It is high over the Hudson and so popular that, although the renovation includes a parking lot, you may have trouble finding a space to park. The walk and the views are very pleasant and, unlike most of the attractions in the Hudson River Valley, they're free. We enjoyed the Walkway so much that, during the two weeks we were in the area, we walked it twice. See also our review of the Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area.
In a way, I have been waiting my entire life for Walkway Over the Hudson to open. As a kid, I looked up at this bridge with a sense of wonder and inquiry. My family told me bits and pieces of history about the bridge. For decades, the decay of the Poughkeepsie Railroad Bridge epitomized a city stuck in a post-industrial decline. Even as a kid I knew people believed the bridge to be an eyesore, a 19th century relic raining down pieces of its infrastructure onto a seemingly powerless city stuck in decay. But even as a kid who enjoyed watching things blow up, I always hoped for something more than demolition. Years passed and various schemes for turning the bridge into something other than a dilapidated structure fell through. My hopes were consistently dashed and I figured the bridge would pay the ultimate price for just plain existing and be sent to the scrap heap. Luckily this did not happen. After a few years of work and $38.2 million dollars, I no longer have to wait on baited breath believing the bridge could be torn down. Now the Hudson Valley has one of the longest pedestrian bridges in the world. That's all it is: a bridge. 6,767 feet of surface to walk on 212 feet above the beautiful Hudson River Valley. But simplicity works wonders here. Sure, there are some kinks to be worked out (the porta potties were a mess and parking is tight), but things like that will likely be taken care of in time. The bridge will not be a cure all for Poughkeepsie's problems. And surely no one really believes this either. Nevertheless, it's heartening to see a suffering area turn a piece of it's aging infrastructure, a piece of it's history, into something useful and beneficial for the Valley.
The Walkway over the Hudson is defiantly something different to do outside. It's about a three mile walk (one end to the other), which overlooks the Hudson River. The view is awesome, they have security on site, and they have a number of vendors selling snacks. Saturday they were selling ice cream, chips, candy, water, and the ultimate best....girl scout cookies. Also, if you don't feel like walking, you can go for a run, rollerblade, or go for a bike ride. It doesn't matter what you do, as long as you have fun doing it!
The Walkway Over the Hudson is an old railway bridge that has now been converted into a walking bridge. It was not in use for many years (since before I was even born), and then it was decided that instead of tearing it down the state would turn it into a walking bridge. The view from the top is stunning. The rolling Catskills, the perfect backdrop for a summer sunset; the glittering Hudson River below (one of the few times I've thought of the Hudson this way; the miles and miles of green shore on either side. It's also magnificent in the fall when the leaves start changing-a rainbow of colors! It's a nice brisk walk to the other side and back, and a windy walk at that! But it's literally like a breathe of fresh air during those hot summer days, especially since there are no shady spots anywhere. Definitely not a spot to be missed in the Hudson Valley!
What can you say beyond: This is awesome! ? It's wheelchair friendly, dog friendly, kid friendly... not so friendly for people with height anxiety, but I walked happily away from the edge. It was a great time ad I look forward to going again!
Beauty-rrrific. Seriously. There isn't another (made-up) word that comes to mind. We did a fun family excursion and traipsed across the expansive and historic bridge. Families biked, some rollerbladed, most people walked, and some true view lovers brought chairs and plopped into place for the afternoon. Open from dusk to dawn, the placards of interesting info, the amazing view, and the ice cream at the end of the road (*woo-hoo!), just have me thinking 'beautiful' and 'terrific;' a word just for the Walkway: Beauty-rrific.'
Come on folks, it's just a walking path.  The views are average, even for the Fall.  Don't get me wrong, I think it's great that they turned a train bridge into something for the general public to enjoy, but I think they still need to "pretty" it up a bit.   If you drive to the Poughkeepsie side, the path to get to the actual walkway is pretty long.  Not to mention the parking area still needs some work.  The ground is uneven, dusty and gravelly.  At first you're accosted by the bathroom facilities.  The 4 or 5 port-a-potties located right after the parking area smell like low tide in a heat wave.  Then the black top pavement, which is about 12 feet wide is lined with trees, but you can still see abandoned, rusted sheds and other sorts of junk and detritus just behind them.   There's only one food vendor with crude signs and it didn't look bright or new, just creepy and unsanitary.   When you finally get to the entrance of the walkway, it is rather nice, clean, if plain and very functional.  I don't know, I guess I was expecting something a little more creative and playful, maybe interactive, as with the Highline in Manhattan. All you do here is walk straight across, chat with your friend, stop to take a look at the bridge and the water below, rest on a bench maybe, start to walk back to your car.  I could have stayed home and worked on my kegel exercises.
An absolutely beautiful way to see the Hudson Valley fall foliage.  DH and I went with my parents on a Saturday afternoon in late October and it was the perfect time to catch the leaves at their most gorgeous!   I was a bit worried because DH has a fear of heights but the bridge was just wide enough that he could walk away from the sides without it bothering his neurosis.  We walked the whole way across and back from the Highland side which has a small lot for parking @ $5 a car otherwise there is free street parking.  They keep it interesting all the way across with little fact plaques concerning the bridge and of course the view!  Be sure to bring a camera. Also on the Poughkeepsie side is a fresh ice pop stand that have the tastiest treats for a break especially on a hot day!
Gotta love going up the stairs and walking on this lovely walkway!  You can take cute pics, see the bridge, water, etc.  Everyone's walking/running on here, even in 25 degree weather!
Such a gr8 feeling, this bridge walkway. I have had many lovely experiences walking here with friends and my new husband...wouldn't it be a gr8 venue for a wedding? Occasionally wyou might run into some people who think this is their personal trek site, or pretentios dog walkers without respect for the public...but I am such a fan anyway. I love seeing the kids awe over the gr8ness of the height...the river below or about the stores they read about the Great Railway. I am saddened about the parking...but it will remain a 5 in my heart. And...lets NEVER change the name...it says everything!
The Walkway is very impressive. It's basically a much higher, taller version of the High Line in NYC. The views of the Hudson Valley are breathe taking. Be warned that it's very windy up here. Also, you should enter through the Highland side, the Poughkeepsie side starts more inland and therefore, you need to walk a while to get to the river. Also less people enter through Highland so plenty of parking!
This is an awesome feat of engineering originally built as a train bridge is now a Walkway Over the Hudson! It is amazing. Another reviewer mentioned it as a version of the Highline and it certainly is, except the view from up here is even more amazing! We parked on the Poughkeepsie side. The parking lot has a $5 dollar parking fee. Make sure to remember your spot number as you will need it for the parking machine. After paying you will proceed on the path to the Walkway. Don't forget to use the bathroom and throw out your garbage before proceeding. They don't have any garbage cans and bathrooms on the bridge. The bridge is a slow incline and decline so it is not physically taxing. It is pretty windy near the middle of the bridge but the view is incredible.  Make sure to wear comfy walking shoes. They are dog friendly, so don't forget to bring Scooby. I can't wait to return to the Walkway!

The view is awesome, especially when the leaves change. The only thing more I can say is: Come walk across the bridge.

Do you want to run or walk,but feel like you are flying?? This is what this Walkway is all about!  An old rail road bridge converted into a walkway to take a romantic stroll,or a calm jog or a mad hatter run! At 30 F,we went for a jog over this bridge. The scenery is absolutely breath taking that we didn't notice our fingers swell and freeze due to the climate.  The whole train is around 3.5 miles,it starts at the new walkway and you return  to the start by crossing the Mid-hudson bridge which has two stops to listen to some automatic music;this was kind of weird but hey!! if you want to propose to your girl on top of a river and forgot about the soundtrack,then this is the place.Just the hit button and complete the moment! :)  Can't wait to go again for biking or another calm jog!! I would call it my Nirvana walk :) -Smriti

Worlds Longest Pedestrian Bridge...  New York's newest State Park..  all adds up to a day of fun and exercise with the family.  Throw in some frozen treats on each side of the bridge and your family can bond like ours did while strolling 3 or so miles across the Hudson River and back.  We started in Po-Town where we found parking on the street (parking in the lot will cost you $5)  Awesome views of the Hudson both North and South, be sure to bring a hat and some sunblock if your there on a Sunny Day.   Our DD made it about 1/3rd of the way across and got a ride on Daddy's shoulders the rest of the way.  One of the food \ drink stands on the Lloyd side of the river had a gentleman who had a beautiful parrot (named Simon) who he let people hold and kids pet.  After a shoulder ride back across the river, Daddy, Mommy and Daughter were all too pooped to pop and headed home for the day.  All in all a great day out. I'd definitely add this to anyone's itinerary looking for local attractions to visit in the Hudson Valley.  One of the cooler things we've done in a long time!!

Having not been back to Poughkeepsie since this opened, I knew this was pretty much the only thing I HAD to do while in town. Nevermind the fact that it was in the middle of December and utterly freezing. We parked in Poughkeepsie on a side street. If you aren't sure exactly which way to go, head up towards Marist, and take a right by Palace Diner/St. Francis--you will see signs. It's a beautiful and interesting view unlike anything else you can find. The Hudson was icy and eerie, you could see the rooftops of all the houses, and take a peek through the spyglass thingy-ma-bob to check out the Mid-Hudson Bridge (sorry, FDR, whatevs). Definitely a place to go back time and again throughout the whole year. I really hope it brings new life to Poughkeepsie.

This is so amazing!!! I loved doing this.  I wish it was later in the year so we could of rented bikes but the walk was still awesome!  I wish we lived up here this is truly a great place!!! KUDOS!!!!! You can use your phone to get a "tour" which was fun and informative, but my phones service SUCKS which is not their fault its all my companies.  but the idea that you can call a number and press a number from plagues along the bridge and hear about the history of the bridge, the animals, and history of the area is just so cool.  AND ITS ALLLL FREEEE!!!!!

Really neat walkway over the Hudson. Although there is no road traffic there was tons of bike traffic this weekend during my visit with my family.  It would seem that they had some kind of bike marathon crossing the bridge but no signs indicating such. Had the bikes not been permitted on the bridge during the weekend when they have maximum tourists visits, then my visit would have been even more pleasant.  A few people nearly got mowed down by a few bikes. They also have interactive signs along the bridge that I thought was really neat.  You phone a number located on sign to hear more about the walkway and other historic facts.  A pleasant walk but I wouldn't go out of my way to see it.  If you are in the area it certainly is worth the visit but not worth a drive more than 40 mins in my opinion.  Parking is limited at each end & cost money.  On a Saturday afternoon I found street parking with no problem adjacent to walkway for free.

While visiting friends up in Newburgh, NY, my buddy had planned a visit to this scenic tourist spot as a part of my itinerary.  I was not argueing since I had interest in this since first learning of it last year. Simply put, this is an old freight rail line that has been painstakingly reworked into a pedestrian thoroughfare and it spans from Highland Mills to Poughkeepsie NY over the Hudson River.  There are beautiful views all around this structure.  There is some paid parking available but depending on how far you end up away from the entrance you can also do that for free.  There is no charge to walk the span but you can make a donation as there is a drop box that allows you to do that.   There are signs at various points and you can listen to what they are all about by using your cell phone.  I didn't do this, as I was busy trying to get some nice photos.  Perhaps I will go back sometime.  Either way, if you can find some images online I hope they inspire you to take the ride up to it.  You must bring a camera and of course take a lot of photos of this massive span.  However, you should bring a couple of bottles of water and some sunscreen depending on the time of year you go.  This was a hot day and I was melting.  This is especially a must bring water thing if you are bringing a dog with you.  That is not fair to your animal and I was annoyed seeing some folks with no other accessories for their pet other than the leash.   I did not find any of the maps that I saw some people holding and that much disappointed me but oh well.  Perhaps they will mail me one if I ask.  I will just try to win them over with my high rated Yelp post :) - It will take you a little over thirty minutes to cross this if you are in shape and walk fast.  Its 1.3 miles long across, and remember that you need to go back to your car at some point.  Let that be the guide on how far you go.  I walked the whole thing.

This is a 1.5 mile bridge over the Hudson, 200 feet in the air, spanning between Poughkeepsie and Highland.  I'm not sure I'd come here from another state to visit - there are far more interesting things to do in life - but for a New Yorker desperate to get outside and breath clean air with a baby, it hit the spot.

Great experience- I'm glad I took the trip.  We entered from the Poughkeepsie side and I was nervous about that but it was absolutely fine.  The parking lot on Parker Ave. was very easy to get to.  We parked in a lot right off the road that was free although unpaved and a bit bumpy.  There was a pay lot right next to it, but we didn't see it until we walked up to the walkway path.  Our lot was just fine though. It is right next to the path and super convenient.   It takes a bit of time to on the walkway to get to the river, but it was really nice.  There were concession stands and bathrooms on our side which was nice for the way back. There are lots of families and we felt very safe and comfortable.  It is really beautiful up there-  you'll get great pictures.

This is such a beautiful beach, that anyone in the hudson river valley can walk across, if they have lots of energy.  it only took 45 minutes to cross in one direction.   Not backed by popularity, if crossing from the Dutchess Co. side to the Ulster Co. side, you end up crossing an area with all trees.  This area is not too breezy.  Then, a few moments later, you see several houses in the area.  YOu see below Route 9, and later the Poughkeepsie Amtrak/metro North train station.  By this time, on a decent day, the breeze should pick up.  A few moments later, you cross the river.  Today, it was so nice and breezy, I had to do this.  After taht, you cross into Ulster County and over to Highland.  By the time you reach highland, this is the only place that actually has Port-o-pottys set up(about 6 of them).  There are several rocks on this side of the river. I'd advised people to not bring their dog.  It's 95 degrees for people's feet.  Think about it this way: the dog does NOT have shoes on, that absorbs some of the heat.  DO NOT bring your dog to this bridge. Also on the Ulster Co. side, there are some benches and some concession stands.  Use these to freshen up.   I enjoyed my trip across this bridge.  if everyone can stop by the tent that is is marked "Walkway Over the Hudson" and sign the logbook(no matter where you live) you'll be astounded at where other people come from, and helps them decide too what areas the Parks Service needs to promote. The bridge is run primarily by trained volunteers(non-profit), however, there are a few staff members who are paid.These people sit underneath the tents on either side, and are wearing red vests. When crossing the bridge, realize that you are not the only one crossing the same bridge, and that you are all in it together.  if you do get heatstroke, there are others on the bridge who can relay the message and get some assistance to you.  The bridge is more than a mile and a half long, and so, this is a good place to absorb most of peoples' energy. I forgot to mention, while crossing the bridge, there are several benches set up, at popular places(for picture-taking), as well as several colllection boxes for money for the organization.   I liked seeing out the one side of the bridge, a view of the Mid Hudson Bridge(Franklin D. Roosevelt Mid Hudson Bridge), and would come again someday, just to see this bridge once more. Also on the bridge, there are several signs in place, that hold phone numbers to call, that give people additional info on the building and restoring of this bridge.  It was primarily a former railroad bridge.  On sign number "30#"(which you can dial on you phone while on the bridge), it states that over 1,000,000 rivets were removed and several million steel bolts replaced these rivets.  On several others, there are several other facts, but I don't want to spoil all the fun with reading these all to you.  You need to do some of this yourself. Supposedly, the bridge is open every day of the year(with the bridge only being closed when lightning is nearby.)  The volunteers are trained on how to remove people from the bridge, as quickly as possible, when the fear is around. Make sure to bring at least $5 if you plan on walking.  And also make sure to wear proper footwear(along with wearing socks during the summer.  Sneakers as well as socks are both essential parts of the walking experience. Another big plus: wear sunscreen.  Take this point, so you don't end up with skin cancer. And even on the Poughkeepsie side, there are a second pair of steps on Washington Ave that you can get out of the car and, after parking on-street, park your car, and walk.  I didn't happen to see parking meters there. Oh, there are no water fountains, at this time, on either side of the bridge.
This is such a beautiful beach, that anyone in the hudson river valley can walk across, if they have lots of energy.  it only took 45 minutes to cross in one direction.   Not backed by popularity, if crossing from the Dutchess Co. side to the Ulster Co. side, you end up crossing an area with all trees.  This area is not too breezy.  Then, a few moments later, you see several houses in the area.  YOu see below Route 9, and later the Poughkeepsie Amtrak/metro North train station.  By this time, on a decent day, the breeze should pick up.  A few moments later, you cross the river.  Today, it was so nice and breezy, I had to do this.  After taht, you cross into Ulster County and over to Highland.  By the time you reach highland, this is the only place that actually has Port-o-pottys set up(about 6 of them).  There are several rocks on this side of the river. I'd advised people to not bring their dog.  It's 95 degrees for people's feet.  Think about it this way: the dog does NOT have shoes on, that absorbs some of the heat.  DO NOT bring your dog to this bridge. Also on the Ulster Co. side, there are some benches and some concession stands.  Use these to freshen up.   I enjoyed my trip across this bridge.  if everyone can stop by the tent that is is marked "Walkway Over the Hudson" and sign the logbook(no matter where you live) you'll be astounded at where other people come from, and helps them decide too what areas the Parks Service needs to promote. The bridge is run primarily by trained volunteers(non-profit), however, there are a few staff members who are paid.These people sit underneath the tents on either side, and are wearing red vests. When crossing the bridge, realize that you are not the only one crossing the same bridge, and that you are all in it together.  if you do get heatstroke, there are others on the bridge who can relay the message and get some assistance to you.  The bridge is more than a mile and a half long, and so, this is a good place to absorb most of peoples' energy. I forgot to mention, while crossing the bridge, there are several benches set up, at popular places(for picture-taking), as well as several colllection boxes for money for the organization.   I liked seeing out the one side of the bridge, a view of the Mid Hudson Bridge(Franklin D. Roosevelt Mid Hudson Bridge), and would come again someday, just to see this bridge once more. Also on the bridge, there are several signs in place, that hold phone numbers to call, that give people additional info on the building and restoring of this bridge.  It was primarily a former railroad bridge.  On sign number "30#"(which you can dial on you phone while on the bridge), it states that over 1,000,000 rivets were removed and several million steel bolts replaced these rivets.  On several others, there are several other facts, but I don't want to spoil all the fun with reading these all to you.  You need to do some of this yourself. Supposedly, the bridge is open every day of the year(with the bridge only being closed when lightning is nearby.)  The volunteers are trained on how to remove people from the bridge, as quickly as possible, when the fear is around. Make sure to bring at least $5 if you plan on walking.  And also make sure to wear proper footwear(along with wearing socks during the summer.  Sneakers as well as socks are both essential parts of the walking experience. Another big plus: wear sunscreen.  Take this point, so you don't end up with skin cancer. And even on the Poughkeepsie side, there are a second pair of steps on Washington Ave that you can get out of the car and, after parking on-street, park your car, and walk.  I didn't happen to see parking meters there.

Great for a leisurely stroll or a vigorous run/walk. The views are amazing and there are rewards (popcorn, drinks, snacks and bathrooms at either end).

No need to tell the history when it has been told three times already. Let's get straight to the point, my experience! Well, I picked the worst day to walk the bridge, 30mph gust below freezing level, but it was worth all of that! I would come back again to take pictures since I didn't get a chance before. Great place to replace the usual walk in the park. You can jog and enjoy a different view without it costing you anything. Lights are being set up on the walkway the last time I was there. I don't think they are still open at night but I could be wrong. Otherwise, it is a landmark worth visiting, like the statue of liberty!
Honestly I don't think this can get any less than 5 stars! Amazing views, comfortable strolls with your family and/or your dog You just need to check it out for yourself!

Definitely a must-experience if you are living or visiting the Poughkeepsie area.  Much more pleasant than the Mid-Hudson Bridge because there is no traffic roaring past you. I love the Walkway and have resolved to enjoy this amazing gift on a regular basis in the coming year.
We absolutely LOVE the walkway.  It's been one of the best things to happen to the Hudson Valley and we come here at least once a month, even through the winter.  They just added some vendors, most of which look like basic carts, but Zora Nora's ice cream stands out as the best. We've had the coconut lime & banana something flavors and they were awesome =) It's going to be even better when they connect all the regional rail trails together in a couple of years but even in it's current state it's great! Come walk it already!

Great spot for a walk. Pros: No car traffic. Free ($5 to park in the lot).  Good for couples, kids, bikes, runners.  Excellent views.  Signs along the walk have fun history facts about Poughkeepsie & the Hudson River.  Bathrooms, lemonade stands & sandwich vendors are on each end of the bridge, as are dog watering bowls. Cons: no shade over the river

YES. Great, natural place to see the valley, get some exercise and get some fresh air. Beautiful addition to the community. Ride you bike there and save on parking!

I try to convince everyone in the city that it's worth the trip up to Po-town to experience this. The few times I've gone, it's been incredibly windy (to be expected, regardless of time of year.) The views are stunning and the idea that you're walking across an old piece of local history is just too cool. There are great photo opportunities both up on the walkway as well as on both the Poughkeepsie and Highland sides. Be careful if you go on a weekend, as it gets busy and there tend to be a lot of cyclists, skate boarders, roller bladers, etc. who often don't have any consideration for the pedestrians!

I love the walkway. I'm very happy that they did this! I live very close to the walkway,and I think its an great form of exercise to jog over with my dogs. The only thing I hate is when people don't pick up after their dogs. It ruins it for everybody that does (like myself) Maybe to have trash cans on the walkway

After walking the Highline ,I figured it was time to do this walk over the Hudson.It's free and well worth it.I think it's about 1.2 miles each way and I recommend going in on the Highland side.We were originally going to go in on the Poughkeepsie  side until we saw the entrance to the walkway blocked by a really strange couple having an argument.The neighborhood is seriously run down and has a questionable feel to it.We did pay $5 to park.By the way , I advise going on a relatively cool day .

Look, it's a nice view from the bridge up and down the Hudson, but it is hard hot concrete for a mile.  Not a good place to take the dogs.  If you do, be sure to take a scooper and some bags because they were out of bags when I went and the concrete can be a bit abrasive on the bag when you're doing the pickup.  :-( Definitely not taking the dogs there again, ever.

So happy to finally check this out. It was the Friday of Memorial Day weekend and thankfully it wasn't too crowded and the weather was perfect.  Indeed a very nice spot for a walk or jog or just taking in the view.  I'm surprised there aren't any benches on the bridge but I guess it's to keep folks moving along.  There are small food vendors on both ends of the bridge with picnic tables to sit down and rest before you make the walk back to your car - it's roughly 2.5 miles from one end to the other.  There are signs throughout the bridge sharing the history of the bridge and the river which doesn't hurt to check out.  Looking forward to more visits.

Sure, it's nice and all that, but certainly not worth the hype.
Pretty sweet historical bridge. I gave it a three because the park area surrounding the bridge needs a lot of work. The bridge is awesome piece of history that anyone should experience. But I think it could use a few minor clean up details to make this an American classic.

what beautiful views! my boyfriend and i made the trip up over the weekend; we parked on the poughkeepsie side. there is a $5 parking fee and only one machine where you can pay, so there could be a long line if it's really crowded.  we only had to wait a few minutes. i will echo a previous yelper who said there are no garbage cans, which i thought was kind of weird.  also, maybe my opinion is skewed because i'm from the city, but there were no bike lanes which i thought was odd considering the amount of bikers there were.   we stopped halfway across the bridge and enjoyed the views and breeze from the benches there.  there was one refreshment stand on the poughkeepsie side.  that's it!  if you make the walk, especially on a hot day, make sure you are properly hydrated! there are posters along the bridge, with phone numbers you can dial for your own audio tour, which were very informative.  they have images from past and present. we plan to go back in the fall to see the fall foliage - it must be beautiful from there!

My friend and I had the PERFECT day to explore this walkway. It was about 80 degrees and very sunny. We saw so many friendly people who smiled as they walked by us. The amazing views were everywhere. Two downsides are that some people do not clean up after their dogs and the stench from the bathrooms on the Highland side where we parked our car. It is quite a stunning experience and very exhilarating. We will be back in the fall so that we can experience the lovely leaves turning their magnificent colors.

Lovely walk on a beautiful day in June. It gets really hot on the Walkway, as there is no shade. We took my 9-year-old Norwich Terrier. She did fine, but probably would have preferred a walk in the woods. There's water at each end for dogs, but carry some for people & pooches.

there's no better feeling than taking a leisurely walk over the hudson, what a great thing to do on a sunny day, beautiful, this is new york at it's best wear comfy shoes, sunglasses or hat, pack water and a sandwich and you're good to go

Some cool LED lighting was just installed on the walkway, turned on last night (May 16, 2010)
This place is great for the views - it really is one of a kind. How could you not love it? Well, here are a couple annoyances that prevent me from giving 5 stars - 1.) Parking is really deplorable. It's either that you're lucky enough to get one of the 30 spaces in the immediate lot (at the beginning of the trail) or you have to park 5 blocks down the street which is a nightmare if you anyone in a scooter or a wheelchair. Also, did I mention you have to pay for parking now? Not unheard of in a state park but seriously.... it's such a terribly small parking lot that it really is a mockery (especially when you see all the rocky, flat space around it and wonder why they can't expand it...) It's a great place to take your dog but unfortunately, a lot of other people have the same idea so if you have a dog that doesn't get along with other dogs or if you have a small dog, be aware because some of the other people with huge dogs don't really pay attention and let their big dogs have their way with your tiny dog (sniffin' all up in their biz). I also wish there was a garbage can - even a tiny one - on the walkway itself because I hate holding a bag of dog poop the entire way with my pup. But it's a great place - the foundation that supports the walkway is run by some awesome people. All in all, a great place. One unique usage of the walkway? A lot of people use it to take wedding photos! Great any time of year..... definitely not to be missed.

Short 'n' Sweet!  This is a fantastic place to exercise... if it's not cold or rainy!  1.28 miles for the bridge.  Take the "loop" and you can do both bridges for a total of 3.6 miles.  Check out the old train station while on the loop.  Stop for a beer at Mahoney's Irish Pub.

I should have listened to my mother-in-law three years ago!  Yes, thats right, my mother-in-law told me about the Walkway Over the Hudson when it opened three years ago but I did not visit the walkway until my last trip to NY in July.  I made it a routine to walk it each and every morning.  It is a great way to start the day by walking across the Hudson...everyone walking, cycling, running and skating seems to have a positive vibe.  I love this bridge and plan on taking advantage of it each morning when I visit NY!

Make some time in your schedule for an enjoyable walk over the Hudson. The views are lovely in the evening. A perfect spot for a stroll with a loved one (even if that loved one is a pet).  I cannot believe this place wasn't more packed than it was.

This pedestrian bridge is an awesome piece of local flavor.  I have to recommend it strongly to anyone who's not terrified of heights (it felt extremely safe, however).  The views are, as mentioned, spectacular.  Pack a picnic or grab a bite from a vendor while you're there; my suggestion is to grab a something at Rossi's Rosticceria Deli first, it's only a short drive away.  Obviously dress for the weather, there's no protection from the elements.

Awsome transformation of the old rail bridge into a pedestrian walkway.  The views up and down the Hudson from it are spectacular and the connection of the two rail trails on either side extends an already great trail network.

Great walk and beautifully scenic views looking in all four directions. I walked this a couple of days ago around 3 pm and the temp was great- the foliage walking toward Bear Mtn. was Gorgeous. Locals jogging w/ their dogs and tourists, but not overcrowded at all. Just remember to leave earlier in the afternoon if you plan on going into the trail recently opened in the mountain's park so you don't have to leave via an exit on the other side of the bridge- you can walk over from the State Park or from stairs on Park Ave in Poughkeepsie. Also, bathrooms and concession food just beyond the park gates are convenient and helpful.

It was a really great idea, it was done in a great way, the design is excellent and the experience is great!
We stopped off from a long drive to get some excercise. The bridge was beautiful, the scenery even better.

An awesome civic monument. Wonderful views of the river and surrounding landscape, happy families everywhere, a feeling of pride and adventure. A fabulous renewal of a rail bridge to pedestrian walkway. A mile of wonderment far above the mighty Hudson.

LOVE this place!  Great place to take a leisurely stroll in the fresh air, incredible spot to catch a sunset.  Careful when bringing your dog--the pavement gets very hot and can singe his paws.  Loads of activity: biking, jogging, wheelchairs, and wee children.  The other night I even saw a woman with a parrot on her shoulder....

I took my 2 teenage girls out on a nice day to the Walkway over the Hudson. We parked in on the west side in Highland and walked over the bridge to Poughkeepsie. That is when we decided to continue on the 3.6 mile loop recommended on the map at the end of the bridge. Big mistake. The next 1.5 miles was scary. There were no other hikers/walkers on the route, only drug addicts and people hanging outside their Section 8 housing units. The streets were littered with garbage and the sidewalks were broken and uneven. My daughters made me promise I would never take them there again. My advice is the walk over the Walkway and turn around and walk back the way you came. Why the NYS Parks would recommend this loop, I don't know. Not good, seriously.

What an excellent walk!  Breathtaking views, benches to stop and rest and bathrooms at the end...what more could you want?

this is definitely worth checking out. the bridge itself, while immaculate and painstakingly clean, isn't all that interesting. a wide stretch of grey concrete, without much character. but if you're looing down at the bridge, you're missing the point. look up, look left, look right. look over the side. you will see the hudson valley and catskill mountains in 360 panorama in all of its glory. you're suspended over the hudson in a natural setting that evokes art. great all year round, but especially amazing during autumn and foliage season. in summer it can be warm at first, but near the center, you catch a breeze from the river.

Wow! Amazing! And it's actually exercise too! Bring all your friends.

You have to do this at least once, I swear. This renovated railroad bridge sits over 200 feet above the waters of the Hudson, in a clear sunny spot amidst rolling verdant hills. In this Yelper's humble opinion, this is ten thousand times better than the Highline. No expensive vendors, no snotty Meatpackers, no drooling tourists, and no views obstructed by luxury condos. Just you and nature, and a few diverse families and exercise enthusiasts. My suggestion is to not just walk the bridge, but keep traveling along the Rail Trail. You'll find some gorgeous scenery and  the quaint town of Highland along the way. I have a few Brotips: 1. Wear comfortable shoes. Even a round trip walk over the bridge is about two miles, more if you want to continue. The stairs on the Poughkeepsie side are designed with grates, so anything with a heel could possibly get stuck in the grates (though I have no idea why you'd walk this in heels). 2. Wear sunblock. Even as the sun is going down, it's still bright. 3. Wear bug spray. On the trails, the woods are damp and moist. 4. Bring water. The vendors kinda marked up the price of water, at least from what I saw ($1.50 instead of $1.00). 5. Bring a garbage bag. There are no trashcans on the bridge. By the way, don't pay any mind to the reviews of the jaded NYC residents complaining that the view is not that interesting. In my opinion, I'd rather see a contoured hilly landscape than lame Manhattan or Jersey any time.
Beautiful views and a great place to get some fresh air on a beautiful day.   The ride up and down the elevator was great, can't beat the views.  Don't forget your comfi shoes and some sunblock.
Gorgeous view of the Hudson river in the middle of Hudson Valley area. Even better for everyone without a car too since Poushkeepie is reachable by Train and you can make a whole day trip out of the visit coming here is a must! The view here makes walking across George Washington Bridge very different, instead of Manhattan skyline you get an awesome view of the valley its quite breath taking during the time when I visited in Autumn when leaves are turning color. Its a very popular walk reminded me of the Highlines, actually its just an Hudson Valley version of Highlines over the river :) From end to back took us about 1.5 hours to walk through on a slow stroll with plenty of picture time. We were coming from Mohonks that day so parked on the western side of the river where they had a free parking lot. I think there's an even closer parking lot but there's a fee so its definitely worth it just park little further since you'll be doing bunch of walking anyway :P It makes the view more spectacular as you start walking on the bridge until slowly the river comes into view. Oh since you'll be walking over the river it does get quite windy if you're not visiting during Summer months so definitely be prepare for the weather, an extra jacket or layer I would definitely recommend. Lastly there's also an elevator that takes you to ground level to check out the park and view right by the river bank, Unfortunately I didn't get a chance to ride it since they close at 5:30. But the bridge itself is open until sunset everyday. On my visit I saw a lot of workers there so they definitely do their best to keep the place nice and clean for everyone to enjoy. It can get bit crowded especially around the two ends of the bridges but its definitely worth the walk. Highly recommend you visit if you're up here in the Hudson Valley enjoying nature.
Did the WALK over the Hudson last year - VERY Nice.   Tried the Bike trail that runs across the the Walkway Over the Hudson AND Mid-Hudson Bridge yesterday with mixed reviews.   Especially troublesome are the bike path going form Highland Hamlet to the Mid-Hudson Bridge.   Overall, this is a nice ride, be prepared for the steep uphill and lack of signage in some places. Here is the summary.   - Parked in Poughkeepsie, Walkway East parking lot  (easy, lots of signs) - Rode our bikes across the Walkway and in the Highland Hamlet (easy, good directional arrows) - Ride from Highland Hamlet to the Hudson River (no signs, but a nice downhill ride) - Ride on Oakes Road, next to the train tracks to Mid-Hudson Bridge (easy) - Try to find the path from Oakes Road to the Mid-Hudson Bridge (painful).  There are no signs here.  To get to the Bridge, you need go UP a steep path (before the bridge) that looks like someone's driveway and walk past the wooden gates.  Took about 20 minutes for us to find this path.  We need a sign here. - Need to carry your bike up the steep stairs to the Mid-Hudson Bridge (Nice cardio here) - Parking lot by the Mid-Hudson Bridge (nice view) - Riding across the Mid-Hudson (nice ride) - Riding to the Poughkeepsie water front.  Once again, there are no signs here, but you can find the waterfront easily. - Nice place to take a break and have dinner here. - Riding back to the parking lot (PAINFUL).  Steep Uphill, no signs what so ever. - Wish the elevators were running (didn't they open the elevators last week??)
A nice day trip to check out the changing of seasons and get some serious steps in. There is lots of free parking around and bathrooms/sani-cans. The only thing to watch out for the is all the dog "droppings" on the bridge. The view is nice and you can try and be creative with your photos between the hills and water and some boats. If your really ambitous you can check out the shops in hyland but we never made it there. Combining the bridge and some another activity makes for a nice day trip. there are other things to do around the area (winery! or brewery) so not much effort to make a nice fall trip.
There is a 4.2 mile hike that will take you across both the Walkway and the Mid-Hudson bridge and through Poughkeepsie.   Definitely something to try at least once if you visit the area often, however, I wouldn't include a visit here for my first two or three day trips to the area. This seems like a walkway/park to be enjoyed by those that live in the area as opposed to a tourist attraction.
This place is a must for every New Yorker who wants to enjoy the greatness of Hudson River. It is a spectacular footbridge. It took me about 1.5 hours to walk down the whole bridge. Highly recommend you to try it in autumn. The weather wasn't that nice today. It is cloudy and super windy. Remember to bring a trench coat, a scarf or a hat, sometimes umbrella.
Good weekend activity to get your blood pumping. The walkway is clean and the view is amazing. Instead of sitting at home, why not take a stroll across the Hudson. The aerobic activity is light; nothing to strenuous. This would be a cute date activity.
having been spoiled by Oregon's mighty Columbia River, the Hudson just doesn't compare.  BUT this walkway is pretty impressive, on an old railroad bridge.  tons of locals exercising.  wasn't very busy though on a weekday afternoon.  perfect weather, just a tad overcast.  if you're afraid of heights, ummm, stay away...you're pretty high up.  across and back, it's about 2 miles.
One of few things that makes me miss living in Poughkeepsie.
What's better then a gorgeous walk/bike ride/run/stroll/dog walk on a sunny day. I think if you're looking to be active, this is an amazing place to do it. I cannot wait to bring my bike up here and doing the bike paths that are all around on either side. I wouldn't come here JUST to do the walk...but if you're in the area I think this is a fantastic way to spend a few hours. FYI: next month (July) they're opening an elevator that goes to the top which is so awesome. If you're looking to grab a bite afterwards - head to Crave
Worlds longest elevated pedestrian walkway! Keep supporting this awesome attraction. This walk way bridge is must see when visiting the area. It's about 1.28 miles one way. Scenic view of the mountains and the the vehicle bridge nearby it. At the one end of the bridge they have restrooms and food stands to purchase and even tshirt's!  While walking on the bridge they have signs posted about history and different facts along the bridge. Be sure to catch a free ride up or down the glass elevator near the Washington Ave end of the bridge. You can see what the bridge looks like underneath and more excellent views. Another tip is if you want to avoid the $5 parking lot you can find free parking on the streets or find the free lots.
I came here with my wife on the hottest day possible (90 + degrees).  The walk was not so enjoyable in that kind of weather, but the view was nice.  Definitely wasn't worth the 1 and a half hour travel to here, especially since the Brooklyn bridge is so much closer to me and has a much better view, but worth checking out if you're around the area.
We were visiting the area for a wedding.  The next day we took a walk on this bridge.  Beautiful views of the changing leaf colors.  Take the elevator ride down and walk along the river bank then take the elevator back up.  Be prepared for strong winds out on the bridge.
Cute tourist thing to do outside of the city. Looks like you can take Metro North Hudson Line to Poughkeepsie and walk to the entrance, which seemed like only five blocks. The entrance is free but nothing really on either side of the bridge, except for a couple of food trucks. The view of from the bridge was ok, we went during the changing of leaves so it makes it a little more interesting, but if it wasn't fall I can only imagine it being a little boring. If you have a dog, bring sparky along, there are so many owners with their dogs. Overall, it's cute to do, I can see my parents wanting to do this, but really it's walking over a bridge, kinda like walking over the Brooklyn Bridge, but more nature like with the fresh NY air.
Took one of my dogs to the Walkway during the Labor Day weekend.   First - parking.  There are many write ups about the parking, but you can park free just outside the pay parking lot.   It was not as crowded as I had expected.  Things were fairly organized, there was a patrol vehicle going back and forth.  Bikes were fine.  But the problem was a group of kids on the scooter.  They were weaving through people very fast without warning. As I had the dog with me, I did not go into the elevator, but there was absolutely no line, and it is free! I am sure it will be more crowded during the fall, but that will be the great time to revisit! This attraction is free, but please do donate at the information center at both end of the bridge!
Nevermind the setting of Poughkeepsie, which is like a factory ghost town with only select gritty, depressing, and depressed organs still functioning. Thanks to the Metro-North, you can get in and out of here for a few bucks, so it's not like you'll be stuck here. The Walkway Over the Hudson basically a world class bridge of cool steel and white hot concrete 2082 meters long (that's 1.3 miles) offering 360-degree views of river scenery that looks like a 19th century oil painting. The only difference between this walkway an amazing bridge that lets the little people walk over it is that here, NO CARS ARE ALLOWED. This is a walkway through and through; pedestrians only (though there was one d'bag trying to rip past people on a bike). Access is as free as can be. There's no gate, no checkpoint, no bullshit. No bathroom, either, from what I could tell, so be forewarned. At sunset, a truck driven by two park-uniformed men in their early twenties gently tell you that the bridge is closed, and drive behind you and all the other lingerers at a firm but non-threatening 3 miles an hour to ensure that everyone leaves so that the structure can be closed securely for the night. People gather here to get a bird's eye view of the Hudson, watch hot air balloons lift into the sky, and gaze out at sailboats and steamboats painting wakes into the blue-brown water. On the 4th of July, they sell tickets so that people can file onto the walkway to enjoy unobstructed views of fireworks for all. Even on a regular day, it's worth the train tickets and walk from the station (though some businesses in the area such as the River Station Restaurant - separate review - offer free shuttles during select hours) to get above it all.
You have to do this at least once, I swear. This renovated railroad bridge sits over 200 feet above the waters of the Hudson, in a clear sunny spot amidst rolling verdant hills. In this Yelper's humble opinion, this is ten thousand times better than the Highline. No expensive vendors, no snotty Meatpackers, no drooling tourists, and no views obstructed by luxury condos. Just you and nature, and a few diverse families and exercise enthusiasts. My suggestion is to not just walk the bridge, but keep traveling along the Rail Trail. You'll find some gorgeous scenery and  the quaint town of Highland along the way. I have a few Brotips: 1. Wear comfortable shoes. Even a round trip walk over the bridge is about two miles, more if you want to continue. The stairs on the Poughkeepsie side are designed with grates, so anything with a heel could possibly get stuck in the grates (though I have no idea why you'd walk this in heels). 2. Wear sunblock. Even as the sun is going down, it's still bright. 3. Wear bug spray. On the trails, the woods are damp and moist. 4. Bring water. The vendors kinda marked up the price of water, at least from what I saw ($1.50 instead of $1.00). 5. Bring a garbage bag. There are no trashcans on the bridge. By the way, don't pay any mind to the reviews of the jaded NYC residents complaining that the view is not that interesting. In my opinion, I'd rather see a contoured hilly landscape than lame Manhattan or Jersey any time.
Two words: pedestrian bridge.... That's it....I don't know what I expected when it was thrown out as an idea to do on Saturday.  I expected a view....there was none.  It goes over the Hudson River and there is a view of the Mid Hudson Bridge (that's right....I said the world famous Mid Hudson Bridge!). There isn't much to do on either side of the bridge (there are bathrooms and food vendors, but nothing worthwhile). The majority of the people on the bridge were jogging, cycling back and forth, or just walking their dogs. There is free parking available on the northside of Haviland Road (or you can park in the parking lot for $5 for 4 hours).
Beautiful views and a great place to get some fresh air on a beautiful day.   The ride up and down the elevator was great, can't beat the views.  Don't forget your comfi shoes and some sunblock.
Beautiful 1.25 mile pedestrian & bicycle bridge across the Hudson River with great views on either side.  Fun activity on a nice day.  Very kid-friendly!

Walkway Over the Hudson State Historic Park is a breathtaking 1 1/4 mile walkway across the Hudson river from Poughkeepsie to Highland NY. It is perfect for those days you just want to take in the fresh air and enjoy the awesome views of the Hudson. We took the old former railroad bridge from the Poughkeepsie side.. you get a to see all of the the amazing views in the city, which over looks the far off Beacon Mt. to the south and up the Hudson river north towards Albany. It is suppose to be the longest elevated pedestrian bridge in the world. And I enjoyed every minute of it over  looking  the city 212 feet high. The walk is a must if you're in Poughkeepsie. The walk was fun and easy watching the boats sail across the river and having the sun shining over the beautiful autumn foliage.
Get out on the walkway on a clear sunny day in the spring time or autumn and enjoy the panoramic views of the spectacular mid-Hudson river valley.  If you live in Poughkeepsie, the walkway makes for a nice cool jog, just be wary of trying to run over it on weekends when it's typically chock full of tourists, hounds, lovers, and children. Also a decent (if not stereotypical) activity for students to do with visiting relatives. A pretty impressive public works project by Dutchess county and the state (I believe), converting an old burnt out train trestle into a New York attraction. Kudos.
There is a 4.2 mile hike that will take you across both the Walkway and the Mid-Hudson bridge and through Poughkeepsie.   Definitely something to try at least once if you visit the area often, however, I wouldn't include a visit here for my first two or three day trips to the area.

Don't get me wrong, it's a fun thing to do once. For a New Yorker desperate for some fresh air, it gets the job done. But would I ever do it again? Not likely.  It does give you those sweeping views as promised - if you like seeing a dirty, muddy brown river, desolate neighborhood landscape (Poughkeepsie) and rolling green hills (at least those are nice). It's also possible I went on the wrong day. The sun was out, but gusting, chilly winds made that walk positively teeth-chattering. Brrrrr. I'm sure if I lived in the area, this would be a welcome respite. But for a two hour train ride from NYC? There are better places to go to get peace and quiet. And it's not like Poughkeepsie is exactly a picturesque quaint New England town. You go there without a car, the Walkway is pretty much the only thing to do.
Good weekend activity to get your blood pumping. The walkway is clean and the view is amazing. Instead of sitting at home, why not take a stroll across the Hudson. The aerobic activity is light; nothing to strenuous. This would be a cute date activity.
Walkway Over the Hudson...one of the most Un-Poughkeepsie things about Poughkeepsie. Though looked over by many due to its Poughkeepsie location this State Park is one of my favorite escapes. Straddling the Dutchess and Ulster County line the Walkway offers a scenic getaway for locals and city-folk alike. The Walkway Over the Hudson offers a round trip hike just shy of 3 miles with 360 degree views of the Hudson River, foothills and surrounding area. With pedestrian only access one can enjoy the surrounding area with peace and tranquility knowing that no motorized vehicle will get in the way. With convenient parking on each side of the walkway (I prefer taking the FDR Bridge to the Ulster side and parking at the State Park entrance) there is little excuse for missing this upstate treasure. If you're coming up from the city via mass transit the Metro North will bring you very close to the site and is a great option for getting here. If possible I recommend taking a car so you may enjoy the surrounding towns and not be limited to the Walkway alone.

a beautiful walk on a nice sunny day .. if you are looking for neat things to do, why not walk on a bridge over a river? parking wasnt too bad once we found it, look for signs. it wasnt too crowded on the nice fall day we were here. it would be nice at sunrise or sunset. bring a camera.
I came here with my wife on the hottest day possible (90 + degrees).  The walk was not so enjoyable in that kind of weather, but the view was nice.  Definitely wasn't worth the 1 and a half hour travel to here, especially since the Brooklyn bridge is so much closer to me and has a much better view, but worth checking out if you're around the area.

Spring is finally here. Walked over the walkway today. The fresh wind from Hudson washed away the long winter blue.

This is so special an experience to be suspended over the magnificent Hudson river and take in the  views. One of the highlights of our too short trip to the lovely Hudson River Valley was ambling over and back on the walkway on a beautiful October morning. I say morning noting that it was remarkably serene when we arrived about 9:15-ish and got substantially more crowded by the time we left. So were we to do this again, we'd choose morning again. A tip we pass along. We started at the Poughkeepsie side and parking was plentiful. Monitors were checking too, to be sure folks paid their fee at the pay kiosk. The parking fee is only $5 in the lot. (Street parking free.) All kind of locals and tourists were  enjoying the morning together on the walkway. Note the photo of the guy on the unicycle who we hear, from the volunteers there, is a morning regular. What a fun show he was to watch! "Housekeeping items:" 1) Bathroom facilities are located on both the Poughkeepsie and Highlands side of the walkway - friends who used them said they were well maintained. 2) One food cart on the Pkeepsie side and several on the Highlands side for those who need a nosh or beverage.  3) Walking distance roughly one and a quarter miles each way. Our other highlights you ask? The FDR Site, Top Cottage, dinner at Red Devon in Bangall (thanks to Lydia L's "heads up"), a vist to the CIA, driving through the beautiful countryside that separates the charming small towns of the Hudson River Valley and the Rhinebeck Sunday morning Farmer's Market.

In a way, I have been waiting my entire life for Walkway Over the Hudson to open. As a kid, I looked up at this bridge with a sense of wonder and inquiry. My family told me bits and pieces of history about the bridge. For decades, the decay of the Poughkeepsie Railroad Bridge epitomized a city stuck in a post-industrial decline. Even as a kid I knew people believed the bridge to be an eyesore, a 19th century relic raining down pieces of its infrastructure onto a seemingly powerless city stuck in decay. But even as a kid who enjoyed watching things blow up, I always hoped for something more than demolition. Years passed and various schemes for turning the bridge into something other than a dilapidated structure fell through. My hopes were consistently dashed and I figured the bridge would pay the ultimate price for just plain existing and be sent to the scrap heap. Luckily this did not happen. After a few years of work and $38.2 million dollars, I no longer have to wait on baited breath believing the bridge could be torn down. Now the Hudson Valley has one of the longest pedestrian bridges in the world. That's all it is: a bridge. 6,767 feet of surface to walk on 212 feet above the beautiful Hudson River Valley. But simplicity works wonders here. Sure, there are some kinks to be worked out (the porta potties were a mess and parking is tight), but things like that will likely be taken care of in time. The bridge will not be a cure all for Poughkeepsie's problems. And surely no one really believes this either. Nevertheless, it's heartening to see a suffering area turn a piece of it's aging infrastructure, a piece of it's history, into something useful and beneficial for the Valley.

The Walkway Over the Hudson is an old railway bridge that has now been converted into a walking bridge. It was not in use for many years (since before I was even born), and then it was decided that instead of tearing it down the state would turn it into a walking bridge. The view from the top is stunning. The rolling Catskills, the perfect backdrop for a summer sunset; the glittering Hudson River below (one of the few times I've thought of the Hudson this way; the miles and miles of green shore on either side. It's also magnificent in the fall when the leaves start changing-a rainbow of colors! It's a nice brisk walk to the other side and back, and a windy walk at that! But it's literally like a breathe of fresh air during those hot summer days, especially since there are no shady spots anywhere. Definitely not a spot to be missed in the Hudson Valley!
Get out on the walkway on a clear sunny day in the spring time or autumn and enjoy the panoramic views of the spectacular mid-Hudson river valley.  If you live in Poughkeepsie, the walkway makes for a nice cool jog, just be wary of trying to run over it on weekends when it's typically chock full of tourists, hounds, lovers, and children.

Beauty-rrrific. Seriously. There isn't another (made-up) word that comes to mind. We did a fun family excursion and traipsed across the expansive and historic bridge. Families biked, some rollerbladed, most people walked, and some true view lovers brought chairs and plopped into place for the afternoon. Open from dusk to dawn, the placards of interesting info, the amazing view, and the ice cream at the end of the road (*woo-hoo!), just have me thinking 'beautiful' and 'terrific;' a word just for the Walkway: Beauty-rrific.'
Don't get me wrong, it's a fun thing to do once. For a New Yorker desperate for some fresh air, it gets the job done. But would I ever do it again?

An absolutely beautiful way to see the Hudson Valley fall foliage.  DH and I went with my parents on a Saturday afternoon in late October and it was the perfect time to catch the leaves at their most gorgeous!   I was a bit worried because DH has a fear of heights but the bridge was just wide enough that he could walk away from the sides without it bothering his neurosis.  We walked the whole way across and back from the Highland side which has a small lot for parking @ $5 a car otherwise there is free street parking.  They keep it interesting all the way across with little fact plaques concerning the bridge and of course the view!  Be sure to bring a camera. Also on the Poughkeepsie side is a fresh ice pop stand that have the tastiest treats for a break especially on a hot day!

Such a gr8 feeling, this bridge walkway. I have had many lovely experiences walking here with friends and my new husband...wouldn't it be a gr8 venue for a wedding? Occasionally wyou might run into some people who think this is their personal trek site, or pretentios dog walkers without respect for the public...but I am such a fan anyway. I love seeing the kids awe over the gr8ness of the height...the river below or about the stores they read about the Great Railway. I am saddened about the parking...but it will remain a 5 in my heart. And...lets NEVER change the name...it says everything!
Windy but great views. Bring a scarf, camera, comfy shoes and hot cocoa.   Minus one star for lazy dog owners who left poop and didn't clean up!!
The Walkway is very impressive. It's basically a much higher, taller version of the High Line in NYC. The views of the Hudson Valley are breathe taking. Be warned that it's very windy up here. Also, you should enter through the Highland side, the Poughkeepsie side starts more inland and therefore, you need to walk a while to get to the river. Also less people enter through Highland so plenty of parking!
a beautiful walk on a nice sunny day .. if you are looking for neat things to do, why not walk on a bridge over a river? parking wasnt too bad once we found it, look for signs. it wasnt too crowded on the nice fall day we were here. it would be nice at sunrise or sunset. bring a camera.
This is an awesome feat of engineering originally built as a train bridge is now a Walkway Over the Hudson! It is amazing. Another reviewer mentioned it as a version of the Highline and it certainly is, except the view from up here is even more amazing! We parked on the Poughkeepsie side. The parking lot has a $5 dollar parking fee. Make sure to remember your spot number as you will need it for the parking machine. After paying you will proceed on the path to the Walkway. Don't forget to use the bathroom and throw out your garbage before proceeding. They don't have any garbage cans and bathrooms on the bridge. The bridge is a slow incline and decline so it is not physically taxing. It is pretty windy near the middle of the bridge but the view is incredible.  Make sure to wear comfy walking shoes. They are dog friendly, so don't forget to bring Scooby. I can't wait to return to the Walkway!
