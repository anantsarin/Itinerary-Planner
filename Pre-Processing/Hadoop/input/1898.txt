I love to order red fox delivery to Marist library when I'm holed up in there all day studying. Unfortunately the delivery minimum is $20, even for just across the road, but all that means is I order a second sandwich for the next day. Great, fresh, quick food.
I absolutely love their wraps! Great place with very speedy service, they have all sorts of sandwiches, wraps, and even a small Korean menu. Tons of chips and drinks to accompany your deli menu pick. I really enjoy the staff as well as the always fast service. A tad pricey, but you also get a lot in your wrap/sandwich. Try the spicy bbq chicken and onion sandwich!
So originally my sweetheart and I came to Poughkeepsie because we were in the mood for Japanese food and when we arrived at the location we came to find out the Jap spot had relocated so we went ahead and yelped this place and judging by the reviews we went for it. My oh my we were pleased as soon as we walked in, we were expected just to take out but when we walked in we were stoked that there were booths to enjoy our lovely meals. We ordered Paninis, fries and 2 smoothies because we could NOT just have one with the deliciousness in a cup he provided us! I've never in my 21 years of living have ever tasted such a fresh tasting smoothie, my boyfriend says it reminds him of back home in the Philippians and that warms my heart to hear him say. We were also amazed by the variety of the menu, and even more it was price friendly for such great quality food! This place is wonderful, the owner is a spectacular, intelligent, and personable man.  I loved speaking with him and hearing him say he's more worried about the quality of the good than making a profit, that was the cherry on top! Were looking forward to an opening in the village of New Paltz !
Fresh-brewed Green Mountain coffee paired with Soft-baked choco chip cookie. Satisfying panini sandwich: generous, high-quality layers of ham with pesto, balsamic, marinated red peppers, lettuce, fresh mozarella and oh-so-good toasted panini bread. Alright, I'm sold.
First time here. Nice size menu. A good variety. Food looks great and tastes even better. Fresh. It's cool like a regular deli, but has Korean food as well. Nice people. Quick service. Right across from Marist College.
3 1/2* They let us create a vegetarian sandwich which wasn't on the menu which was nice. They toasted the sandwich without asking, wish they hadn't.   The service was friendly and quick and this is an easy place to grab a quick bite before taking a walk on the Walkway Over the Hudson.
I wouldn't exactly call it a Korean restaurant. It's owned by Koreans, but they mostly serve the deli type wraps, sandwiches, and lunch plates with the occasional Korean side. It's located right across the street from Marist College, home of the red foxes! My friend ordered a beef and rice combo that came with a side order of kimchee. It's not often you come across good kimchee in Poughkeepsie. I'm originally from Hawaii where it's a pretty commonplace dish and I had to order myself a separate side to fulfill a long standing craving. It was delicious. Homemade kimchee...I'll be back for more. I had the avocado chicken wrap, side of kimchee, a drink, and a bag of chips all for around $10. Good deal! The owner and workers are extremely friendly and welcoming. And it's a newly opened place, so I only expect it to improve.
Super low-key sandwich place with good food and the sweetest owners ever.  No, you're not going to find house-cured pastrami on artisan bread here, but it's obviously a place for students. I had a tuna wrap, my partner the Cajun chicken hot sandwich -- completely perfect for our road trip up the Hudson.
Great Sandwiches, Best in Poughkeepsie.  So many choices, so I started at number 1 and will work my way through!.

Some of the rudest service I've ever experienced in my life. The food is mediocre at best- if you're looking for a good deli go to K and D or Rossi's; you will be much more satisfied. The owner has zero understanding of customer service and is blatantly disrespectful. Please take this as a clear warning- do not eat at red fox.

Love the Philly cheese steaks here. Fast service.
Just went to the place for lunch with a few friends. I had trouble deciding between a wrap or a chicken parm sandwich so the owner ripped off a piece of chicken from the wrap and handed it to me! Definitely not korean food but run by very friendly koreans. The food itself is great and priced appropriately, wraps and sandwiches sit around 6.75 and the food tastes so real. I will be going back for lunch for sure.
