Small, awesome shoe store. Quality over quantity! Came here to buy a pair of TOMS one day. The staff is very attentive and the owner is super nice! Def come by and get a pair of shoes here :)
So I met a "friend" of mine where she's a nurse at Columbia and I wanted to get her out Saturday night but she wouldnt go because she had no shoes to wear.  Enter:  Yelp!  Closest shoe store still open?  Boom, Vamps is open til 8, lets check it out...   I'm clueless about womens shoes, but I do know we got there at 7, she got shoes for like $80 (I actually picked up a pair of Timbs too. I hate shopping so I figured as long as I'm waiting for her...), ran them back to her locker at the hospital by 7:30 and we were on our way to dinner by 8.  Painless shoe shopping can be done!
Great service. The 2 men that were working were super nice ans very attentive. They didn't force anything and helped me find a nice cute flat.
