Any time I visit Buffalo I make it a point to go to Jasmine at least once. If I'm there for more than a few days I'll enjoy a lunch and dinner. I have been to many Thai restaurants but none better than Jasmine. The waitstaff is friendly and helpful. The food is made fresh with flavors that pop and blend magnificently.
I've been frequenting Jasmine for about 5 years now. And somehow I find myself always coming back every now and then. I've been coming here even when they had the entrance on the other side of the dining hall. Alas, it seems I am less impressed with them than before, that given the current scenario, I am only willing to give them 3 stars. Take our latest visit, for example. It was a Friday evening, and yet it was not crowded at all. There were several staff present, more than enough to handle the amount of diners. And yet, there was the unnecessary wait. Tables weren't cleaned as fast as it should have. We asked for chopsticks, but the request was forgotten that I had to call the attention of another staff for it. Signs of sloppiness were present: when our order of Thai Iced Tea was delivered, together with the waters, the cream used in the iced tea was drizzled on the sides of the water glasses. The food was okay, if not for the less-than-desirable service, I would have given this place 4 stars. But I was not content with the way they handle people, so I removed one star. I am not crossing this off my list, but I would definitely be willing to try some other Thai restaurant and compare.
Definitely not the best thai food ever. Maybe coming from Portland where there is a Thai restaurant on every corner, I'm a little spoiled - but for the prices that this place charges, the quality of Thai food isn't all that great. I've been here three times, once ordering curry, once ordering pad thai, and once ordering pad see ew. The time I ordered curry, it was nothing spectacular, the rice was a little dry/old though - but the price for curry was pretty premium as far as curries go in my opinion. The pad thai and the pad see ew both had rather soggy noodles. The plus side of this place is that if you like spicy foods, they will not hesitate to make it as spicy as you like it. The service is nice. All in all though, it's an OKAY Thai place, but I will probably not be a regular.
Shared spring rolls with my girlfriend who got Bangkok Pasta (if you don't know what you want, definitely try this) and got Shu-shi shrimp myself. The Shu-shi shrimp was definitely up to par, the coconut curry sauce reminded me of my Singaporean neighbor who used to always make similar dishes. I got the mango ice cream for dessert and loved it. It tasted like they just mixed mango and ice together without the sour taste it sometimes accompanies. In terms of the ambiance, it's a nice place for a casual dinner or date.
Great food, great atmosphere, great service!  Whenever I crave thai food, I go here.  You won't be disappointed! I recommend the red curry duck and the tom yum soup.  Mmmmmm....
I went to this place because of enthused Thai-seekers on Yelp having battling opinions on this place versus Taste of Thai.  I ordered take-out for just myself and I usually do a comparison of foods when I try a new place with ethnic cuisine.  I just have to say that the chicken pad thai was many many levels below some of my favorite places both in Buffalo and on Long Island.  I still stick by my word that if you want the best Thai food in Buffalo go to Taste of Thai and not really waste (ok a little harsh) your time with this place.  Noodles were dry,  but more for the cost of the dish but I rather have a sauce that can please than more food in my belly.  Your choice!! But as I trekked a little bit further for take-out I won't be returning!
Been here twice in the last 10 days.  Probably been here a dozen times total, and all I can really talk about is one dish: the panang curry.  I go with chicken, my friends get it with tofu.  I'm not sure what they put in it, maybe crack, it's that addictive.  I don't usually overeat when I go out (sometimes I take half my entree home), but it's like I'm a rat in some experiment where my sense of fullness has been suppressed, and I eat until my stomach bursts and I die (happy).   What i'm trying to say is: get the panang curry.   Service is fine, the price is right (though it's an extra buck for more rice), and rarely a long wait to be seated in my experience.  I enjoy the other Thai places around Buffalo, though I can't claim to know what is more authentic.  I do know that Jasmine has my favorite Asian dish.
Positives: Tons of vegetarian options and the food is really good. The portion sizes are huge, so it always ends up as 2 meals for me. They have a small menu, but every time that I've ever gone here every member of our party has enjoyed what they ordered. They have tons more items on the dinner/take-out menu that I'd like to try. Negatives: The cooks won't customize your meal to your desired level of spiciness. They point you to a canister on the table, which does work but takes a little more effort since the plate is small and they fill it to the brim with food, so it's tough to stir in the additional sauce. We sat right next to a fish tank with a giant eel in it that kept opening it's mouth and making faces at me. Normally, I like fish but this one was just creepy looking... Having just moved here from Cleveland, one of my biggest regrets is leaving behind my favorite Thai place of all time. When my mom came to visit me in CLE last year, I managed to get her hooked on Thai food. Since then, she and I have been on a mission to find the best Thai in Buffalo. We are always taking suggestions on new places to try!
Mediocre Thai food on the main drag in Buffalo. My expectations weren't very high, and they weren't disappointed on two trips here. Which is to say I'd prefer not to have to eat here again if possible. Bland food, even when you ask for it hot. The fantastic chicken, apparently, was not, but they did accomodate my dining partner's weird requests for a totally off-menu item and he was satisfied. He is, however, a sort of human garbage can, and his recommendations cannot be trusted.. They charged for soda refills, which raised my hackles.
Consistent good food. Love the Tom yum shrimp soup, chicken cashew and pad gapow, yum beef. Service is minimal but efficient.
Went there early haloween night after having a LONG and very bad day.  The food was some of the best I can remember!  Had Pad Thai & some appatizer... WOW!  good food!
Ohhhhhh what to do what to do.  Jasmine or Saigon bangkok?  both are on Niagara falls blvd and both are asian of the non WOK-# variety.   I would say Jasmine is more of a Thai / 'chinese' restaurant and Saigon bangkok is more of a Thai / vietnamese restaurant.  both are good, both get 3 stars IMO.   However, when you throw Red Pepper into the mix (just around the corner on Maple, Vietnamese / Chinese), I often choose Red Pepper because I find their prices to be most fair, service is rapid yet warm and food is always fresh.
Jasmine's made me fall in love with panang curry. I had no idea what this was until I ordered it for lunch special here. It was delicious. I like their atmosphere here because it's not a noisy restaurant and on the quiet side, which I like so you're able to hear each other while having a conversation. Their crispy calamari is really good, especially their sauce that comes with it! Lunch special is a reasonable price, on the cheaper side, with pretty good portions.
Up till now, I can't find a restaurant that offers better Thai food than Jasmine Thai. I'm a big fan of their Pad Thai and Bangkok Pasta. I'm from California where the selection of ethnic food, particularly Asian food, is far more diverse than Buffalo, and still I miss their Pad Thai when I go home. So, why didn't I give them a 5 star? Well, the service here is on and off. Some waitresses are ruder than others, but the owner (she seems like it), a Thai lady, is very nice. My resolution for it? Order take-out every time. Their portion is huge, and for a small Asian girl like me, their Pad Thai lasts me three days no joke. I also didn't like the time when I ordered their Thai coffee and asked for it to be less sweet, and the waitress told me that it was "already pre-made" so the sugar level couldn't be changed. When she brought it out, it was clear that the coffee was made by, well, mixing black coffee (still on the bottom) with milk, and clearly the less milk added, the less sweet it would have been. My coffee that day was basically a sweet soup fest. I do blame myself for ordering coffee at a food place, but come on!
Tasty food, good service.
Chicken panang was amazing. FYI - When you say spicy on the Tom Yum soup you get SPICY!!
Pretty good food. Close to horrible service, rude and unorganized. Fried tofu appetizer is up to par, dumpling are kind of dry and the curry is tasty. Food is quite inconsistent. Overall a bit above average 3 starts
"Jasmine and Gatorade is the best solution for a hangover." Well, at least according to my friend. Jasmine is one the only, or one of the only, Thai styled restaurants that I know of in the area. The place has dishes that you can find in any other Thai restaurant, but it holds up against those that you may find, even in the city. The prices are extremely fair, as the dishes come in a generous proportion and size. There doesn't seem to be a lot of MSG in the food, but that could be attributed to the longer cooking time (as in the food can take a while to come). The place is rather small, and seating can get cramped. During peak times, the place can get crowded and you could wait for a while as well. That's probably attributed to how this place is, popular and good tasting.
It's my first year here at UB and my asian friends were obsessing over Jasmine's pad Thai. That's literally all I heard. "Hey let's go to jasmine's today!" "Lets go grab some pad Thai from jasmine's" "Why did you go to jasmine's without me!" So since all I heard that the pad Thai is really good, I decided to go with two friends. My friend and I both ordered Pad Thai. He ordered the beef pad Thai and I ordered the shrimp and chicken pad Thai. My other friend ordered the Tom yum soup (he ordered it "extra spicy" which he later regretted). For appetizers, I ordered the vegetable tempura and the shrimp tempura. The shrimp tempura was okay. The shrimp was extremely thin and I think about 4 came with it. The vegetable tempura? It was greasy. It was okay, but every time I took a bite of the broccoli, oil dripped down which was pretty disappointing because tempura isn't suppose to be like that. Well anyways, onto our pad Thai. It looked pretty appetizing, however it wasn't the best authentic pad Thai I've ever had. Yes it was good. The portion was insane! However it was super greasy and it wasn't very pleasant. I'm giving this place 3 stars because my friend enjoyed his Tom yum soup and my other friend enjoyed his pad Thai (considering it was his first time eating it). I would definitely come by this place next time but try something else besides the pad Thai. I guess I was being too bias.
This place has been a grad school staple, regular lunch place for our lab. I've been here countless times and I always order the same thing: tom yum soup seafood and bangkok pasta vegetables, both without cilantro. I really hate cilantro and most of the time they do a good job of leaving it out, but sometimes they forget. Whenever I have ordered anything else, I've been disappointed, not a fan of any meat dishes here either. The chicken is really tough for me. My friend thinks the spring rolls here are amazing though. And the mango ice cream is homemade, super tasty!
Just came back here after a long time away. It's great for the price and good for large groups.
I had never had Thai food before and was a little nervous but I had the Pad Thai and it was fantastic.  Large portion and very tasty. I have some back several times and its always the same, perfect! The service is quick and very nice and always helpful in every way. I love Thai food because of Jasmine!!! THANK YOU!!
JT is starting to grow on me and I think it has better Pad Thai than King & I and Saigon Bangkok.  It's consistent and they give you more food than at the other two.  However, the other two are clearly nicer and fancier looking places to dine.  But for takeout, Jasmine Thai just might be the best in Buffalo.
Poor service waited 10-15 minutes and no one came to take our drink or food order.  Three staff people standing at the cash register talking.  :( never will go back I love being ignored.
Great first experience AND it was take-out! I ordered the chicken Pad Thai with a side of peanut sauce, egg rolls, fried pork dumpling, and chicken fried  jasmine rice. I was greeted immediately upon pickup by a super pleasant employee, they checked EVERY box before I leafy to make sure my order was correct- I love that! I was a little surprised by the price at first but when I lifted the bag I knew why. I returned home with enough food for myself a pond my husband for three meals! The food was great and they even included some extra spice if I wanted to fire it up up a little. I will certainly be back and am guessing will turn into a Jasmine junky.
I was back in Buffalo this past weekend for a reunion and made a trip back to Jasmine with my friends.  It's been 5 years since we've been back and still delicious.  I  have eaten at a lot of thai places before and overall, Jasmine is still the best.  Like most people I judge thai restaurants based on their pad thai.  Not too sweet, not too saucy, enough noodles... perfection.  Their panang curry is so unique and deliciou I haven't found it anywhere else.  The amazing beef... amazing.  Their sauces make this place so great.  I wished I came back to Buffalo more often!
Pad Thai is excellent, as are the fresh spring rolls and peanut sauce. Pad kee-mow is HOT be warned. Service is complacent.
The food here was so, so bad.  I had the red curry with tofu and the jasmine fried rice.  My brother had the chicken teriyaki. (Which I wasn't expecting to be that good, actually.  I mean, it's teriyaki at a thai place, I saw that one coming.) The red curry came out on a plate with a spoon that made it impossible to ladle onto my rice.  It was barely warm and you could tell they fried the tofu and slapped it on top - it didn't have a lick of flavor.  The fried rice wasn't too bad, but the seasonings were like something I would put together at home.  I could taste the oils they had fried it in. I was just so disappointed, because a lot of people like this place and while the service was ok (they were attentive to what we needed, despite the fact that I only ate five bites of the dish and they were aware I disliked both of them) it's like they didn't put an ounce of love into a single dish they brought out.  I won't be going here again.
This place serves great food in good quantities. The beef gupow fried rice is awesome. Good ambience and decently priced.
I've been here quite a few times and finally decided to write a Yelp review.  I've eaten there with a bunch of different people--some of them were familiar with Thai food, and some were not-- and all of them have loved it.  It's a go to place.  Delicious!!
Please people, don't hate me for the 2 stars. Barry got there before me and had some Tom Yum.  I flew through the doors and was freezing, so I got the Coconut hot & sour soup. Chicken in said soup was wierd..sort of dry and had an odd flavor. The Broth was the same as usual, very good. This has always been one of our favorite restaurants to dine at, but today Barry and I met up for lunch, and it was not as good as it has been at previous meals.  :( The sampler platter that we always order has plummeted from being super yummy and fun to blah.  They have replaced the tempura shrimp with tempura vegetables (we've already known this from the last time we visited, but I didn't know about Yelp! then...) WHO wants to eat a half cooked battered and deep fried carrot medallion?  The tempura veggies were loaded on the platter.  The pork dumplings are half the original size and you only get 2 now.  Same for the spring roll.  The FRESH Spring roll hasn't changed, still monster sized, BUTTT, they added chicken strips to it. Hehhhhh...me no likey that chicken.  We picked thru the rice wrap and just ate the halved shrimps -dipping them into the various sauces.  (Those things are enormous and kill your appetite. ) The flavors of the spring roll and dumplings were still delicious, as were the 3 sauces, but they cheaped out.  We'd rather pay 2 bucks or whatever   more for the original version. We then ordered the Panang chicken to share. Again, the chicken, blehhhkk....  The peanut/coconut sauce was great, lots of cilantro and green onions, but I couldn't eat it 'cause of the "chicken."  Maybe if I had some rice with the dish (I'm trying to be good) I could have drenched it in the sauce, and would have been satisfied. I hate to write this.  The place is special to us and we love Boi/Boy? the host.  Hopefully they will see the picked apart tempura and the huge amount that was left over on our plates and go back to the drawing board.
The Amazing chicken/beef is AMAZING, I'm no custee but. its so amazing that i just don't want to order anything else or I have (ordered something else) and I usually have regrets. the panang curry is also amazing although it doesn't have amazing in its title.
I know their curries aren't that great and that their tom yum isn't the best. I know that the atmosphere is a bit disappointing and sometimes service is slow. But the Siam Squid is still the absolute best Thai dish I have EVER eaten. I was just craving it right now, hence the yelp, but seriously, it is so good. No matter how many other Thai restaurants I try, nothing will ever compare to this dish.
I was in the Niagara Falls area last weekend with my family, and was dismayed with the food options, until a friend pointed me to Jasmine. Awesome food. Jasmine's food satiates my spice palate and my family's as well. For appetizers, the Chicken in Cream of coconut soup was delicious. The Tom Yum was a little too sour for my taste. I recommend trying the Hot Pepper Chicken and Pad Kee Mow chicken noodles (again if you can withstand Thai spice, try this, if not, let them know that you want the spice level to be mild). For dessert, definitely try the Banana Coins.(fried banana pieces). If you don't like the sound of it, try their homemade Coconut or Mango ice cream. It is just heavenly. The service is excellent, and the price is fabulous. A meal for 4 including dessert came upto $60.
Bomb thai
This is by far one of my favorite restaurants.  I spent 12 years in Buffalo and I have enjoyed Jasmine's from the very first time I tried it.  I took my husband here on one of our very first dates and at that time he had no interest in trying Thai food and after his first experience here he fell in love with Jasmine's and Thai food.  When our families came to visit and we took them here, they always wanted to come back just for Jasmine's and not to necessarily visit us :) The Tamarind fish is to die for, everyone I have ever brought here loved it.  The Pad Thai is great and the Jasmine Fried Rice is amazing.  Now that I have left Buffalo, I truly miss this place and hope to one day visit and enjoy this amazing food again.  My husband and I have been searching everywhere to find a Thai restaurant that can compare and we have yet to accomplish that task.  Jasmine's is definitely one of the many gems that I treasure from my experience in Buffalo.
Love the Penang Curry at Jasmine Thai. It's done very well - not to bland, not overly spicy - lots of flavor. Great ambiance and quick yet courteous service. Good stuff.
Great food!  Not good. Great!  Easily the best thai in town. Beef dishes are more flavorful than chicken entrees.
Not the end all of Thai restaurants, but does a decent job.  The Drunken Noodles are good and the price point is reasonable.
Well, I'm a huge fan of Thai food and this place is one of my favourite so far! My friend and I went on a very busy Wednesday night so yes, the waitstaff was a bit slow but not terribly slow.  that being said I usally get it as take away because I like to be by myself when I mow down on pad thai :P I reccomend this place because eveytime I get food there, it's AMAZING!!
I used to go here once or twice a year when I went to college in Buffalo. The food was pretty good and we always had great service when the manager/owner (?) was there. The waitresses, on the other hand, 97% of the time, service sucked! I even had one waitress who pointedly refilled everyone's water glass but mine. It's the service that ultimately made me stop going to Jasmine and reading other yelpers' reviews, I'm not the only one who had a problem with it. I really wish management would do something about this.
I like it here, but I like Saigon/Bangkok a bit more.  I usually get the jasmine fried rice here...I like that more than its pad thai.  The thai ice tea is good here. But the jasmine fried rice was the only thing memorable for me. The pad thai chicken was a bit dry.
"Jasmine and Gatorade is the best solution for a hangover." Well, at least according to my friend. Jasmine is one the only, or one of the only, Thai styled restaurants that I know of in the area.

That's probably attributed to how this place is, popular and good tasting.
It's not as bad as everyone says. I like it! I have been here many times on many occasions. I suggest not having chicken though =x it's quite dry. Beef Bangkok pasta is my favorite. And I lovee the fried calamari. The older guy (I'm not sure if he's the owner) is reallly nice!
It's my first year here at UB and my asian friends were obsessing over Jasmine's pad Thai. That's literally all I heard. "Hey let's go to jasmine's today!"

I would definitely come by this place next time but try something else besides the pad Thai. I guess I was being too bias.
The staff was so nice.  I was in a party of 6 and we got seated right away and loved the chicken pad thai.  My friend got the duck and it was worth a second trip.  I'm only in town for another week and I'm going again.

And the mango ice cream is homemade, super tasty!
From the outside this place doesn't look like much but the food is great!  The dining room is a little cramped and the place is often quite busy so it can feel a little uncomfortable.  Other than that, everything is pretty much great.  The menu offers a wide variety and the waitstaff is very helpful if you don't know much about Thai food.  Definitely a great place to try!
Just came back here after a long time away. It's great for the price and good for large groups.
The curry dishes are perfect for cold weather! I stick with the green curry with chicken.
I had never had Thai food before and was a little nervous but I had the Pad Thai and it was fantastic.  Large portion and very tasty. I have some back several times and its always the same, perfect! The service is quick and very nice and always helpful in every way. I love Thai food because of Jasmine!!! THANK YOU!!
Okay, Buffalo doesn't have a whole lot of Thai restaurants to begin with, I'll accept. But Jasmine is the BEST of the Thai places I've eaten at, in at least 5 other cities !! The food is awesome, and they have a really nice selection of vegetarian options. Plus, when they say spicy they really mean it. Excellent panang curry, Pad kee mow (warning- this is hot!) and pad thai. And the best part of Jasmine is the service- super friendly people, who remember you and your preferences. The decor isn't particularly outstanding, but the large portions of excellent food, and happy service more than make up for it :)
JT is starting to grow on me and I think it has better Pad Thai than King & I and Saigon Bangkok.  It's consistent and they give you more food than at the other two.  However, the other two are clearly nicer and fancier looking places to dine.  But for takeout, Jasmine Thai just might be the best in Buffalo.
Poor service waited 10-15 minutes and no one came to take our drink or food order.  Three staff people standing at the cash register talking.  :( never will go back I love being ignored.
Good food, good atmosphere. The amount of time we had to wait to get our food was the only drawback. But it tasted excellent so we didn't care. Plus my GF and I were there for like two hours and they never rushed us out...just politely re-filled my water glass like 10 times haha.
Great first experience AND it was take-out! I ordered the chicken Pad Thai with a side of peanut sauce, egg rolls, fried pork dumpling, and chicken fried  jasmine rice. I was greeted immediately upon pickup by a super pleasant employee, they checked EVERY box before I leafy to make sure my order was correct- I love that!

Bankok pasta is house made and to die for! Ambience could use a bit of an upgrade, but service was great.
I was back in Buffalo this past weekend for a reunion and made a trip back to Jasmine with my friends.  It's been 5 years since we've been back and still delicious.  I  have eaten at a lot of thai places before and overall, Jasmine is still the best.  Like most people I judge thai restaurants based on their pad thai.  Not too sweet, not too saucy, enough noodles... perfection.  Their panang curry is so unique and deliciou I haven't found it anywhere else.  The amazing beef... amazing.  Their sauces make this place so great.  I wished I came back to Buffalo more often!
We went on a Saturday around 1pm.  Many of the tables were finishing up when we arrived yet we had to wait a good 10 minutes before anyone seated us, strange.  For an appetizer we ordered the fried curry rolls, not so good.  They tasted like curry powder and were poorly paired with a very sweet sauce.  For the main dishes we ordered green curry, pad thai, and pho.  The green curry was by far the best of the mix. Decent pieces of chicken and a healthy amount of vegetables.    Though we are fans of fish sauce the pad thai was soaked it and not enjoyable.  The pho was mixed cuts of beef, all over cooked in my book, and the soup stock lacked all flavor.
I LOVE THEIR PAD THAI with chicken and shrimp (even though the chicken is dried most of the time). Best pad thai I've tasted so far, none comparable. Some places would make it too sweet or sourish but this place hits the spot.  What's also good is the Bangkok pasta, (my girlfriend usually gets that) it has more veggies than the pad thai and has a sweet taste, which she likes. Another  dish we usually get is the jasmine fried rice. That's the 3rd option we might get if we get tired of the 2 above but that's rarely. waitt No I lied, the pengnan chicken is also good.. If you like curry this is a good dish. Sometimes it can be dried tho. We've been eating here for 5 years and now that we left school, we missed it soo muchh.. Thai ice tea is what we order to wash down our food with. veryy good, Must try**.. We asked the server a few time to recommend  something and they seem to always recommend the "amazing chicken". We found that very bad, so try to avoid it, even though we only tried it once that's how bad it was. We didn't want to try it again because we already had our favorites. So out of the 5/6 years we were in school, we must've ate there 2-4 times a month. So for now Jasmines, we still hope to see you soon if we ever stop by Buffalo again. One more thing if you like your noodles hot.. the Peekamao I think it's call is comparable to the Bankok pasta but with heat, So if you like it hot, that's what I suggest.
Pad Thai is excellent, as are the fresh spring rolls and peanut sauce. Pad kee-mow is HOT be warned. Service is complacent.

I hate to write this.  The place is special to us and we love Boi/Boy? the host.  Hopefully they will see the picked apart tempura and the huge amount that was left over on our plates and go back to the drawing board.
The Amazing chicken/beef is AMAZING, I'm no custee but. its so amazing that i just don't want to order anything else or I have (ordered something else) and I usually have regrets. the panang curry is also amazing although it doesn't have amazing in its title.
I know their curries aren't that great and that their tom yum isn't the best. I know that the atmosphere is a bit disappointing and sometimes service is slow. But the Siam Squid is still the absolute best Thai dish I have EVER eaten. I was just craving it right now, hence the yelp, but seriously, it is so good. No matter how many other Thai restaurants I try, nothing will ever compare to this dish.
I was in the Niagara Falls area last weekend with my family, and was dismayed with the food options, until a friend pointed me to Jasmine. Awesome food. Jasmine's food satiates my spice palate and my family's as well. For appetizers, the Chicken in Cream of coconut soup was delicious. The Tom Yum was a little too sour for my taste. I recommend trying the Hot Pepper Chicken and Pad Kee Mow chicken noodles (again if you can withstand Thai spice, try this, if not, let them know that you want the spice level to be mild). For dessert, definitely try the Banana Coins.(fried banana pieces). If you don't like the sound of it, try their homemade Coconut or Mango ice cream. It is just heavenly. The service is excellent, and the price is fabulous. A meal for 4 including dessert came upto $60.
Bomb thai
This is by far one of my favorite restaurants.  I spent 12 years in Buffalo and I have enjoyed Jasmine's from the very first time I tried it.  I took my husband here on one of our very first dates and at that time he had no interest in trying Thai food and after his first experience here he fell in love with Jasmine's and Thai food.  When our families came to visit and we took them here, they always wanted to come back just for Jasmine's and not to necessarily visit us :) The Tamarind fish is to die for, everyone I have ever brought here loved it.  The Pad Thai is great and the Jasmine Fried Rice is amazing.  Now that I have left Buffalo, I truly miss this place and hope to one day visit and enjoy this amazing food again.  My husband and I have been searching everywhere to find a Thai restaurant that can compare and we have yet to accomplish that task.  Jasmine's is definitely one of the many gems that I treasure from my experience in Buffalo.
Love the Penang Curry at Jasmine Thai. It's done very well - not to bland, not overly spicy - lots of flavor. Great ambiance and quick yet courteous service. Good stuff.
Great food!  Not good. Great!  Easily the best thai in town. Beef dishes are more flavorful than chicken entrees.
Not the end all of Thai restaurants, but does a decent job.  The Drunken Noodles are good and the price point is reasonable.
Well, I'm a huge fan of Thai food and this place is one of my favourite so far! My friend and I went on a very busy Wednesday night so yes, the waitstaff was a bit slow but not terribly slow.  that being said I usally get it as take away because I like to be by myself when I mow down on pad thai :P I reccomend this place because eveytime I get food there, it's AMAZING!!
I used to go here once or twice a year when I went to college in Buffalo. The food was pretty good and we always had great service when the manager/owner (?) was there. The waitresses, on the other hand, 97% of the time, service sucked! I even had one waitress who pointedly refilled everyone's water glass but mine. It's the service that ultimately made me stop going to Jasmine and reading other yelpers' reviews, I'm not the only one who had a problem with it. I really wish management would do something about this.
I like it here, but I like Saigon/Bangkok a bit more.  I usually get the jasmine fried rice here...I like that more than its pad thai.  The thai ice tea is good here. But the jasmine fried rice was the only thing memorable for me. The pad thai chicken was a bit dry.
It's not as bad as everyone says. I like it! I have been here many times on many occasions. I suggest not having chicken though =x it's quite dry. Beef Bangkok pasta is my favorite. And I lovee the fried calamari. The older guy (I'm not sure if he's the owner) is reallly nice!
The staff was so nice.  I was in a party of 6 and we got seated right away and loved the chicken pad thai.  My friend got the duck and it was worth a second trip.  I'm only in town for another week and I'm going again.
From the outside this place doesn't look like much but the food is great!  The dining room is a little cramped and the place is often quite busy so it can feel a little uncomfortable.  Other than that, everything is pretty much great.  The menu offers a wide variety and the waitstaff is very helpful if you don't know much about Thai food.  Definitely a great place to try!
The curry dishes are perfect for cold weather! I stick with the green curry with chicken.
Okay, Buffalo doesn't have a whole lot of Thai restaurants to begin with, I'll accept. But Jasmine is the BEST of the Thai places I've eaten at, in at least 5 other cities !! The food is awesome, and they have a really nice selection of vegetarian options. Plus, when they say spicy they really mean it. Excellent panang curry, Pad kee mow (warning- this is hot!) and pad thai. And the best part of Jasmine is the service- super friendly people, who remember you and your preferences. The decor isn't particularly outstanding, but the large portions of excellent food, and happy service more than make up for it :)
Good food, good atmosphere. The amount of time we had to wait to get our food was the only drawback. But it tasted excellent so we didn't care. Plus my GF and I were there for like two hours and they never rushed us out...just politely re-filled my water glass like 10 times haha.
Bankok pasta is house made and to die for! Ambience could use a bit of an upgrade, but service was great.
We went on a Saturday around 1pm.  Many of the tables were finishing up when we arrived yet we had to wait a good 10 minutes before anyone seated us, strange.  For an appetizer we ordered the fried curry rolls, not so good.  They tasted like curry powder and were poorly paired with a very sweet sauce.  For the main dishes we ordered green curry, pad thai, and pho.  The green curry was by far the best of the mix. Decent pieces of chicken and a healthy amount of vegetables.    Though we are fans of fish sauce the pad thai was soaked it and not enjoyable.  The pho was mixed cuts of beef, all over cooked in my book, and the soup stock lacked all flavor.
I LOVE THEIR PAD THAI with chicken and shrimp (even though the chicken is dried most of the time). Best pad thai I've tasted so far, none comparable. Some places would make it too sweet or sourish but this place hits the spot.  What's also good is the Bangkok pasta, (my girlfriend usually gets that) it has more veggies than the pad thai and has a sweet taste, which she likes. Another  dish we usually get is the jasmine fried rice. That's the 3rd option we might get if we get tired of the 2 above but that's rarely. waitt No I lied, the pengnan chicken is also good.. If you like curry this is a good dish. Sometimes it can be dried tho. We've been eating here for 5 years and now that we left school, we missed it soo muchh.. Thai ice tea is what we order to wash down our food with. veryy good, Must try**.. We asked the server a few time to recommend  something and they seem to always recommend the "amazing chicken". We found that very bad, so try to avoid it, even though we only tried it once that's how bad it was. We didn't want to try it again because we already had our favorites. So out of the 5/6 years we were in school, we must've ate there 2-4 times a month. So for now Jasmines, we still hope to see you soon if we ever stop by Buffalo again. One more thing if you like your noodles hot.. the Peekamao I think it's call is comparable to the Bankok pasta but with heat, So if you like it hot, that's what I suggest.
We stopped by for some take out pad Thai chicken & shrimp, Bangkok pasta, & red curry chicken. Lunch entrees are around 9.00, dinner entrees are 13.97. Each entree comes with a side of rice. Ours sadly did not, they must have forgotten to put them in the bag. We also were a little disappointed that the shrimp we ordered and paid extra for allowed for count'em 3 little shrimp in that entree! All in all, I didn't have to cook. The flavors as usual were delicious. Everyone including the 10yr old fussy eater was satisfied. If you want fresh, great tasting Thai food, this is your place!
First time having Thai so I wasn't sure what to expect,but it was really good ! I got spring rolls and wonton soup for an appetizer and the bangkok pasta for lunch. my friend got some coconut soup and the egg roll for an appetizer and the special of the day for lunch. My soup was good and refreshing-but I wasn't crazy about it. Both lunches were really good,loved it ! Very unique, yummy tastes. The bangkok pasta comes w both chicken and shrimp,but they only give you like 4 shrimps and a lot of chicken-not a huge deal. 3 stars because the service was horrible !! We literally had 3 different waiters. Brought out two spring rolls when I only ordered one, brought out two wonton soups when only one was ordered ( they took it away but it still appeared on our bill ), the one waiter had no idea what the special was or what came w it. I didn't have a napkin so I took one from the Table behind me (I saw the one waitress watching me the whole time),then immediately after she replaced that napkin - ummm hello you could have brought me one in the first place !!  None of the 3 servers came back to check on us and after our food was taken it took 15 mins to bring the bill; the bill was incorrect so the server went went to fix it brought it back again,and it was still incorrect!!  The third time was finally correct. I don't know if they were new or having a bad day. I would go back again; I would just hope that the service was a lot better!
We made reservations for six people. We immediately were greeted and ushered to our table after entering. One of our party uses a walker and this posed no problem at all. I ordered a Vietnamese beer and we decided to place our order for appetizers while we waited for one of our party to arrive. Spring roll, egg roll, Bangkok shrimp, calamari and the pork dumplings. Underwhelming to say the least. We then ordered our main entrees and were able to ascertain from the waitress that we would be able to share dishes. Pad Thai Chicken, Pad Thai Shrimp, Chicken Teriyaki, Jasmine Fried Rice, Mixed Vegetables, a beef and noodle dish, and a fish (haddock) dish. It was difficult maneuvering all the plates as we tried to sample everything. General consensus was the Pad Thai Chicken, Chicken Teriyaki, and the fish were outstanding. Only regret by some of our party was that we did not order it spicier. The Pad Thai Shrimp, and the Mixed Vegetables were good but not as good as the entrees mentioned in the prior paragraph. The beef and noodle dish was fair. We were all stuffed and had quite a bit leftover to take home for rounds 2, 3, and 4. The bill came to $138 including tax and an 18% gratuity. Now I consider that a reasonably affordable bill, but am always a bit disgruntled by a mandatory gratuity. I had intended to leave a $40 tip when my son pointed out that the bill already included the tip. I have read reviews of Jasmines that were unflattering of the service. Our waitresses were very complaisant and helpful. We plan to return soon but I think we will order individually to account for heat (spice) tolerance. We will skip the appetizers for the most part, perhaps try the soups.
This is the best thai restaurant I have come across so far. Fast service and good food. I ordered papaya salad and Panang beef. The papaya was 7/10 and the beef was 6/10. I wish the portions were bigger and they had other authentic thai dishes but in the end I left satisfied. Nothing beats good thai food on a rainy weekend in buffalo.
My favorite Thai restaurant in WNY.  I wish it was closer to the city, but at least I know there is a decent restaurant in the 'burbs when I'm forced to be out that direction. I usually go with my usual, chicken pad thai, but on the few occasions that I ventured out of my comfort zone, I've never been disappointed.  Everything on the menu is delicious.  They recently revamped their menu to include better descriptions and pictures.  It's perfect for those of us who need an extra push to try new items. Staff is wonderful.  Although you rarely see the same server twice during your meal, they somehow have the system worked out so that you aren't neglected at any point. Great for take-out as well.
Good tasting food! Pad Thai always delicious.  Place could smell a bit better though.  Smells like musty feet.  Prices increased since last visit.
One of the most excellent thai restaurants ever. This was the first restaurant I went to in US and it has the most fond memories ever. I have now been around US to many thai places but absolutely none match the quality, taste, freshness, quantity, ambience and aura of this place. Whether it's the pad thai, pad kee-mow, fried rice, lychee drink....the food is to die for!!! Highly recommended for excellent thai food. Love this place!!!!! :) :)
Of course, i found out this place via the Yelp app when I was craving some Thai Food. I visited this place twice. Once for takeout and once for dine in. I was kinda turned off when I asked if they can make my Pad Thai, Thai hot, They said they do not, but we can give you crushed peppers to make it hotter. It's the first time I have herd of a Thai restaurant that didn't make their pad thai a certain level of spiciness. The second time I went I had the Som Tum aka papaya salad. I asked for Thai hot and the server was like, are you sure.  My Dinner friend was like, no lets get it one step back so we did. We got it Hot. We ordered a few other things, like summer rolls, and this other dish. I forgot what it was but it had green beans, chicken in a curry. That dish came out luke warm and I was kind of disappointed in that because the dish it self looked really good. The papaya salad though was on point. I wish the papaya it self had a little more crunch but over all it was really really good. Spring rolls were your standard fare. I wish they didn't skimp out on them and made them a little more thicker and had more filling. I always feel so ripped off on the price paid to what we actually get. Over all, this thai restaurant is pretty good for the Buffalo area. I would for sure come back and try a few other items, and more papaya salad for sure!!
I have job that sometimes doesn't turn Me loose until 7PM.  By that hour I am hungry. Luckily Jasmine was close by.     The hostess quickly got Me seated and in short order My waitress greeted Me.  I drove right into the Thai grove and ordered the Tai Beer.  It was a nice blond beer but had plenty of flavor.     The two spring rolls were very tasty.  The dipping sauce was a perfect accompaniment.  My main course was rice noodles with shrimp. Excellent.     It was only My second try at Tai, I have much to learn. This was a great lesson.
This place is perhaps one of my guilty pleasures.  The food here is very good. Best dish there is the Amazing Beef.  I have tried to replicate the peanut sauce they use and have not been able to do so at home.  The pad thai is also very good there.  I highly recommend the curry spring rolls.  They are small and not really meant to share as an appetizer but they are damn tasty!!!!  Finally, the Thai iced tea is a very sweet and delicious beverage.  Absolutely love this place.  Do yourself a favor and give this restaurant a try.
I'm just going to say mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!!!! Spicy yes! Flavor galore! Cannot wait to go back.
I have had the duck which was amazing and the teriyaki chicken.  The duck was the best I had ever had!  This place is more upscale than other take-out Asian cuisine but it will show in the bill.
Only 4 stars because sometimes the waitresses have been short/rude or it's taken a long time to get our food even though it was not busy. Other than that, the food is fantastic. We went here for one of our first dates and it's a nice, casual environment and good for talking(because they take awhile lol). That was my first Thai food experience and i ordered the chicken pad Thai, so good. I've since gotten that with every meat they offer haha, and also the pho, which is my what I'm used to but so far of the three pho places I've tried in WNY since moving here, the best as of yet. Now that I'm reviewing it, I need to go soon. The portions are large for the pad Thai, can't speak for other dishes though.
3 star for food 1 star for the service I've been here many times and almost everytime I'm disappointed with their service. The food is good and I don't mind coming here more often if the service is good. The waitresses are always talking at the back of the counter. One of them was even dancing there. We have to try so hard to get their attention. I don't need them to check on us a lot, but at least come by after we put down our silverware. I think it all comes down to the management. I have such such bad experience there and it can go on and on. I only go back when my friends suggested to go there and I don't want to be difficult.
This is, hands down, our favorite Thai restaurant in Buffalo, and when we had to move, I shed a tear - not for the friends we were leaving behind...but for Jasmine Thai.  Located in a little strip mall, it's nothing fancy, but actually, I think that makes it better.  We've never ordered anything that we regretted, but our favorites are:  pad kee mow (for the mild version, go with the bankok pasta), pad gapow fried rice, panang curry, and the pad thai is good, too!  And only order spicy or extra spicy if you can really handle the heat.  These folks don't play around when it comes to spice.   The prices are great and the portions are huge - what more can you want?  For dessert, try the mango and coconut ice cream - it's perfect for cooling down your mouth after it goes numb from the pad kee mow! It seems to be a pretty popular place, so if you're wanting to go with a group, especially on a weekend night, I'd play it safe and call ahead to make reservations.   I had a first date with someone at Jasmine's several years ago, and now we're getting married this July.  Love? Fate?  Or just the power of Jasmine Thai? Go check it out and decide.
Not to be confused with a bondage fantasy involving you and a girl named Jasmine, this place is in Amherst across from the beautiful, classical Boulevard Mall complex, which was designed in the image of the great Gare Du Nord in Paris, and of the majestic Houses Of Parliament and Big Ben in London. Right. I've only ever tried the Thai Tea at this place, too, unfortunately, because it was cheaper than the other places, and possibly the tastiest Thai Tea in town (say that 10 times fast). I've had it probably 3 or 4 times since then because I like it so much. It's at least as good as the Taste Of Thai Thai Tea (say that 20 times fast) which is my other fave. I'll definitely come back here for more Thai Tea now that I gave it the Thai Tea taste test (say that 30 times fast), and I'll also have to try taste testing Thai curry too (say that 40 times fast) next time I come in :) I'll adjust this rating once I actually try the food... but based only on the Thai Tea. It has to be a 5.
Come here fairly often for their Bangkok pasta or Amazing chicken. Their dishes are always fresh and cooked to perfection. I only wish their dinner portions were as large as they used to be; it felt like a better deal to be able to take a bunch of food home. Check out the drink menu, too! Great Thai iced tea!
I've been here many times and even with that fact I give this place 3 stars only because I've thrown up after eating their classic Pad Thai (Chicken) two times, out of the four times I've eaten it. I can't explain it but I feel like that's important... Regarding the taste of their Pad Thai, it's really not good as ppl say it is. I've tasted a lot of other Pad Thai's (in Buffalo, NYC, Queens, CA) and none of them tasted as heavy as Jasmine's. Idk what it is, but just not my preferred Pad Thai. But my stomach doesn't react harshly when I eat the other dishes, like my favorite, Pad Kee Mow (Beef, Hot spicy lvl). Also their Bangkok Pasta is pretty good - similar to the Pad Kee Mow with small differences. I would give them an extra 0.5 stars for their decor and ambience. It can be casual lunches/dinners, casual romantic dinner style, can be peaceful enough to come and have a meal by yourself. But don't. That's unnecessary.. Overall, I would come back to eat here from time to time.
So good!! I ordered the pad Thai during lunch. First time coming here and it was a good experience. Friendly staff!
I have met my match on the perfect spiciness. I didn't even need to add anything extra.  I ordered the Pad Kee Mow extra spicy with chicken and shrimp. The dish was fresh and delicious. I also had a fresh spring roll (summer roll) which was up to pair with most I've had at other Thai establishments as well as the Thai iced coffee. The service prompt and efficient.  I definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a reasonably priced authentic Thai restaurant. Well done.
Love this restaurant since I started going to school in buffalo, l like the Jasmine fried rice and pad thai here, they are different from what I tasted in California, I prefer thai food here!!
Long overdue review. Been coming to this place for ~4 years now and it has yet to let me down. The fresh spring rolls is the only item I order for appetizer. Ingredients are simple and light but works well together with the salty/sweet sauce. It's slightly overpriced but I would gladly pay for the convenience when the craving surfaces. The entrees here is consistent and flavorful. There may have been a handful of times where the protein was slightly over cooked but it happens when you go to a restaurant for nearly 4 years. You see their ups and downs. So if I'm in the mood for lots of noodles then I order the Pad Thai w/ beef. Mix the bean sprouts and coriander into the heaping mound of rice noodles. Don't forget the spritz of a lime! Flavor is yummy with your tongue registering salty, sweet, and tangy tones. The crushed roasted peanuts and bean sprouts add a nice crunch and compliments the rest of the dish well. A very safe dish for people who are new to Thai food. Want something more savory but can't pass up the noodles? Then go for the Bangkok Pasta w/ beef (aka Pad See-ew). These are broad noodles. Take that fish sauce that comes with your dish and just drizzle it all over. You'll know why when you take your first bite. A good ratio of protein to veggies (Chinese broccoli in this case). The serving portion is more manageable compared to the Pad Thai. Another safe dish for newcomers. Lastly, if you are simply craving a curry dish then I would hit up the Matsamun Curry w/beef. I like mine medium spice just to enhance the curry taste. The potatoes are cooked to a creamy consistency that just breaks under the pressure of your tongue. Then you are greeted with the sweet and savory coconut curry sauce. Tummy is happy on curry. So do I make it anymore obvious that I love beef? Yes I do love beef but I swear the dishes taste better with beef. It's just more savory than the other proteins served here. It also seems to be more forgiving as an overcooked chicken can really ruin all 3 of these dishes. Lunch time is a bargain, and they do offer take out option that is reliable. My only complaint would be their service during the rush hours. Takes a while to get water refilled, so I would request a water pitcher to be placed on the table so we can help ourselves. Aside from that, the waitresses here are polite, serving time is quick (10-25 minutes) and decor is standard. Definitely one of the better Thai restaurants in Buffalo.
This is one of my favorite places in Buffalo to eat. I was not necessarily a big Thai food fan, but this place has definitely persuade me to think otherwise. I used to go here pretty regularly, but it has become occasionally just because of availability issues. The staff is always very friendly; they are, also, very proficient and quick at what they do, which is always appreciated by someone who doesn't have the luxury of time. My favorite dish here is the pad kee mao (drunken noodles). It's honestly the best version of the drunken noodles that I have ever had. I have tried Thai duck, curry, and pad thai as well. While these are all good and popular items on the menu, it's the pad kee mao that really has my heart. The dish only comes in hot and extra hot. I always get the extra spicy. I must admit, the first few times I struggled to finish the meal because it was just too hot. I have since then mastered it and began to really enjoy it more. Give this place a try, you won't regret it.
Went here for the 2nd time last night. I got the seafood combo, jasmine fried rice. My husband got the seafood combo bean noodle dish (pad wesoon?). I really enjoyed both dishes. It reminded me of what real Asian home cooking would be like. That's all there is to it. The wait is kinda annoying so I wouldn't go there starving. The decor and service is nice enough. They brought us the wrong dishes in the first pass, so that raises a whole issue of hygiene, what did they do with the wrong dishes? The bathroom was clean, no issues there. Overall I would come here again.
I have always been a fan of this place, but recently I went back and found it had slipped down in quality considerably. The service was horrendous. Not rude, but negligent. Nobody seemed to know who was covering our table. Very difficult to get anyone's attention for things we needed. The Tom Yum soup arrived with blobs of hot (spicy) oil floating on top, not integrated. It was not very edible. The shrimp spring rolls were much better. A sauteed shrimp dish (Shu-Shi) was disappointingly dry. The beef pho however was the one bright spot; very tasty with lots of accompaniments. I hope that the management gets its act together again to put this place back near the top of WNY Asian eateries.
My favorite pad Thai in all the land! Okay, in all of Buffalo - definitely will be returning !
The girlfriend and I adore this place. For her, the vegetarian pad thai, and for me...well, anything I find interesting enough to ingest. In addition to being overly eager to eat food, I also do not learn my lesson on taking the Jasmines fried rice as only MILD as opposed to spicy. I like spicy food, I can handle this. A mistake that I've made  more than once. Cause I'm stubborn like that. And my tongue burning is only part of the immediate worry, the bigger worry is...well, pretty self explanatory. I took it down a notch though, I either take pho, or just the MILD fried rice now. Probably the best and most authentic Asian cuisine I've had in Buffalo. Sorry Red Pepper Chinese-Vietnamese.
I really wasn't planning to update this but had to. Went there for dinner for the first time. Busy as expected. Got served a few min later. Ordered the roasted duck, noodles and chicken sateh. The sateh while the sauce was delicious the chicken was overdone. Not tasty. The roasted duck came stone cold. Apparently it got cold waiting for the noodles to cook. They reheated it (aka nuked it). Came back. Was horrible. Dry, tasteless. The noodles were 10% meat, 20% noodles and 70% big ass veggies. It was akin to asking for a coke and getting a glass half filled with ice. An not tasty either. The staff were too busy joking around among themselves to be caring about the customers. Very disappointing experience. Glad this wasn't the first impression, I'd never have gone back!
This was my first visit to this restaurant while in the Buffalo area. Entering the restaurant it was immediately apparent that customer service was lacking a bit because my friend and I had to ask to be seated? Once we were seated the waitress was pretty friendly but clearly did not understand to many english language terms. As a result we ordered an appetizer that was cold when we expected it to be hot. When this was expplained to the waitress she did bring us the substitute that we requested but never removed the first item from the bill in the end. For my entree I chose the jasmine thai fried rice which was served in a large enough portion that I could save half for another meal. I dont remember exactly what my friend ordered but I was also delicious. Overall, the food was delicious but the level of customer service needs improvement.
I ordered Mango Salad and Tod Mun for my meal. The food was ok nothing to crave about. Fried Tuna and Cashews that were in Mango Salad was old, I can't even eat it. I would't go back there.
I love this place! The customer service may not be the greatest but the food makes up for it. Is not that they are mean or anything... it's that sometimes they like to rush you out. Anyway this is not something that will keep me from going back. This is my go-to Thai place. When I go for dinner I like to start with a Thai Iced Tea and a medium Chicken in Cream of Coconut Soup. Is mind blowing how good it is. The entree are served in sharing portions. My typical choices are the the Amazing Chicken (because it really is amazing) and the Shu-Shu Fish, but evertything that I have tried in their menu is very, very good. It's even better as left over the next day. Enjoy!
I love the Chicken Pad Thai and their Thom Yum soup! I always get good service. I've been with small groups and we get seated promptly. My only complaint is that the dining room gets cold in the winter. There are many options on the menu, but I haven't varied yet.
The Red Curry Seafood combo deserves 10 stars.  Love this place.
I was so pissied today! i told them no cilantro on my table because i am allergic to that,but they put cilantro in every dish! the worst of it is that they serve the dishes separatly ,they could have a chance tell the.kitchen that no cilantro in other dishes! overall, it took them over an hour to.cook a soup and some noodles. now, after 10 mins they serve the dishes, they told me they are closed, i need to leave!
Of the Thai restaurants I've tried around Buffalo, I say Jasmine definitely is the better of the rest.  The staff is very friendly.  The food is not in the amazing range but I think it's pretty good given the price.  Not to mention, they give you HUGE portions especially the Pad Thais were I have consistently ordered over and over again each time I'm here.  I recommend dining in because it looks like they give you slightly more than if you were to do take out.  If you can't finish (which most of the time I can't), just take it out then!  I would definitely come back and bring more of my friends here!
Five stars for the food. Service was average, no complaints. Reasonable prices. Did I mention the food? Volcano shrimp was perhaps the best Thai dish I have ever enjoyed. Edit: Oh my, get the bananas for dessert!
Best Green Curry I ever had. Went in for the first time last week and kept thinking I was eating a desert it was so good. Seriously, I have a new favorite Thai place and I've been to many. Why did I wait so long? The location is a nondescript mini plaza, not that it should matter, but... Damn, it was good! And I was in and out in like 20 minutes. The seating is comfy, not over lit, and not too close to others and the wait staff don't get all up in your face and annoying (they're Thai, so I suppose that's normal). Me likey, but for some odd reason they screw up my order EVERY time I go in there. Literally - every time.
Jasmine has been my go-to place for comfort Thai place for when I lived in the suburbs. It's reasonably priced, casual enough for a gathering with friends or a low-pressure first date and the food is pretty good. It's definitely not the best Thai food I've had, but they make up for it with huuuge portions and it being tasty (although it may not blow your mind). I was recently in the area and came back here for dinner and was impressed...again! What stood out to me about the experience: - An aquarium with what Bethany M dubbed: grumpy fish. Definitely pay attention to this funny looking fish! - The kitschy menu names: "AMAZING CHICKEN CURRY," "THAI PASTA" (pad see ei). - Huge portions: I ordered the amazing chicken curry w/brown rice: lots of chicken, curry and I asked for it to be very spicy..and IT WAS. Tons of pepper and kick to it. Had a lot to take home with me and I usually never have left overs. I thought the broccoli and carrots that were served with the dish weren't cooked. I'd have preferred they sauteed them; I think they were going for decoration, but it just didn't work for me. The vegetable spring rolls we had were tasty as well -- loved the sauce they were served with! Yum :) The Thai iced coffee was OK, would have liked it to be a bit smoother. Service was REALLY fast, this was at 8:30p on a Friday night. Our meals were out in like 5-10minutes!
I just wanted to update my review with the incredible customer service I received on Sunday. It was a beautiful day outside and after polishing off a whole bottle of wine the night before, I needed some Pad Thai. It is so easy to call in and place an order. The lady that was working at the counter (I wish I had looked at her name) was so nice and pleasant! Made me wish I would have stayed to have a longer conversation with her. As always, the food was perfect, and a huge portion for just $10. I ate about 1/4 of it for lunch, and then another 1/4 for my dinner. And Brad finished it when he got home. I would definitely recommend this, again. I never have a bad experience!
I have eaten at Jasmine and used their catering several times.  The food is excellent but I have words of caution for vegetarians and vegans. The bad: there are no vegetarian dishes.  The entire vegetarian section has fish sauce or other seafood in it.  To be fair, this is true of nearly every Thai restaurant.  what makes Jasmine worse is even when I ordered whole trays of food for catering, I had to fight very hard with the owner to have the food made without fish sauce.  He whined that it would ruin the taste and leave a bad impression.  I explained that EVERYONE who would be eating it was vegetarian and does not eat fish sauce and he still resisted. The good: Their tofu is amazing. It's gotta almost a cheesy quality to it...like pressed ricotta if there was such a thing.  The panang curry is delicious but alas, not vegetarian.  The catering is unbelievably cheap. For just under $9 per person, you get two main dishes and about three appetizers.  I've gotten pad Thai, panang tofu, crispy eggplant, summer rolls, etc. and everything was enjoyed by all.  You can get satay or tons of other dishes. If you are veg*n, Saigon Bangkok is the only confirmed safe place for Thai food.  I've hear Taste of Thai is as well but haven't asked myself.
For Thai food in Buffalo, I'd say that this place is the best. It used to be a hidden gem in Amherst, but 65 Yelp reviews say otherwise. The only thing that stinks is waiting for a table in a restaurant that doesn't have any standing room.....awkward. I also have a big tolerance for spicy food and their "hot" wasn't hot enough. I'd still go back :)
Late last night we decide to get yet another order of Jasmine's take out.  We share a long time favorite dish, Admiral Shrimp spicy.  Delicious slices of fried eggplant which large tender shrimp, veggies and wonderful sauce (covered in cilantro, YES!). Other favorites include the fried tamarind fish and the ShuShi duck (Duck is a underutilized poultry in the US). Only complaints are that the wait staff isn't very confident and seem flustered especially when they are busy, which they are a lot. We will continue to frequent this place.
Nothing special in terms of Thai food, a lot of my friends rave about it but I did not think much of it. It is pretty expensive compared to the other places you can eat around the area and the food has definitely went down throughout the years. I remember having the Bangkok Pasta(pad see-ew) a few years ago and it was delicious, now it has gotten pretty bland. I am giving it 3 stars because of the pleasant service and the pho here was good. They just can't do Thai food as well as they did before.
I love this place for one reason - my gf introduced me to their pad thai. For a long time I was a really big supporter of Thai Orchid cafe in Williamsville, but this place stole my vote. I think the big difference between the two pad thai's is the sauce. Thai Orchid uses a lighter colored sauce which is very easy on the pallet, but Jasmine's darker more flavorful sauce really brings the dish around full circle. I'm a sucker for pad thai
I ate here as a last meal before boarding a plane to return home, and was a little hesitant as I was afraid the food might be heavy, but it was light and well seasoned! I went there during lunch, and was given the lunch menu. There is an option on the menu which says, "lunch portion" of a dinner dish, so make sure you ask to view the dinner menu as well. I wound up ordering one curry roll and a yum beef salad. The texture of the curry roll was crispy, but the filling could have used more curry spice. The yum beef salad was amazing! There was plenty of cilantro, a large portion of beef and the dressing was delicious. I wish there had been a little more salad because it felt like beef with a side of salad, but it was so good, I can't really complain. My waitress was very attentive, but not overbearing. There is a large parking lot, so driving here is convenient. If I ever visited Buffalo again, I would definitely go to this restaurant!
Came here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon before the boyfriend's flight out of Buffalo. We've been coming here since sophomore (?) year and finally get to review it. This restaurant has a place in our hearts, satisfying our Thai cravings which started at home when we were younger. My go to is always the vegetarian pad thai. It is the standard dish in which we compare all of the new Thai restaurants we try. Jasmine Thai's always comes with fresh raw bean sprouts ("ah-choy" as they say in Cantonese) and ground up peanuts on top. I think that's what puts it a step above others (and why I insist we get it every time.) Also, the rice noodles are usually relatively fresh. This time we also got the Matsuman Curry with steamed tofu. Like others have said, probably not the most "bang for your buck" but it was tasty. The curry sauce is peanuty, salty, and had a kick of spice (ordered it medium) - definitely hit the spot.     The service was good. Our glasses of water were filled promptly and we were asked a couple of times if everything was okay. Just realized, this was most likely our last meal in Buffalo together. (Says something if we chose this restaurant, right?) Until next time, Jasmine Thai (and Buffalo) .. Tear
Best Thai I've ever had...EVER! Service was great and dishes were prepared surprisingly fast for a busy Fri. night. I don't know what these other reviewers are talking about lowered quality, etc. I took my first bite and was floored by the quality and flavors. Just go and see for yourself...
Can't believe I hadn't written a review yet for Jasmine!! I LOVE this restaurant, and I have never been disappointed with the food. The location is a little weird, but I like most of their dishes better than the rest of the thai places around town (I think Papaya has a better pad thai, though). Service isn't 5-star, but you always get exactly what you ordered and after probably close to 40 visits over the last 10 or so years (and lots of take out orders, too), there's never been a mistake. Our stand-bys include the panang chicken, green curry, pad thai, the calamari (soo good) and I love the fresh spring rolls as a quick & cheap lunch. My husbnad also likes the amazing chicken a lot, but it's not for me (a little too rich & heavy on the peanuts!). The thai tea is also SO GOOD! We'll continue to go to jasmine as our stand-by thai fix. If you visit, and you should - say hello to the grumpy fish for me! (You'll know what I mean when you see him.)
I've been to Jasmine several times on separate occasions and have had a good experience. One of the things about ethnic cuisine, is that food is under seasoned for everyone has the ability to enjoy the food. Being Thai, I felt that the noodle dishes could have been more seasoned. The Thai Iced Tea is quite authentic, which I found nice because many places usually water the tea down to save on money. In my experience, the actual thai tea leaves is quite expensive and can only be found in certain thai grocery stores. I would be surprised if the tea was made with a powder instead of the leaves because it tastes (almost) like home. My favorite dish is the duckling, although I've never had "Thai duck" before (Apparently, it's a very popular dish at thai restaurants, but I've never had it while I was in Thailand, nor in my household other than the chinese version) The duckling comes with a side of rice and vegetables with a "black bean sauce". The sauce is quite strong, but I actually love it with the duck. The duck itself is crispy and well seasoned. A few complaints: The homemade icecream (specifically the coconut) could be better. I know it says homemade, and you can definitely taste the coconut cream in it, though you can tell they use some sort of artificial coconut extract. Second: Came here with some friends for my boyfriend's birthday dinner and he had put some of his purchases from the mall on the ground. After the dinner, we walked out of Jasmine and realized that he had forgotten the bag. We walked back in and asked where it was and the waitress had thrown the bag out. This had made no sense to me, especially since there was stuff IN the bag. Why wouldn't you just put it aside in case the customer came back for it? Third: It helps if you speak a little Thai. Many of the staff are Thai/Laos, and I definitely felt a difference in service between myself and my boyfriend's visit vs. my friends and I that are Thai.
I'm from New York City, spent 5 years in Buffalo and a weekend in Phuket, Thailand, and I have to say this is some of the best Thai food I've ever had. Definitely would say its at least one of the best Thai places in Buffalo. I come back everytime I visit Buffalo. I think the taste is right. Thai food is known to be generally really sweet (which I don't like) but Jasmine's isn't and its definintely something that separates them from the competition. The Shu Shi Duck, Tamarind Fish, & Pad Thai (beef) are probably some of my favorites. But theres not too much on the menu that I don't like (I've tried MOST of the food). I think there's definitely something for everyone! Unless your vegetarian...just remember that Fish sauce is a big ingredient in Thai cuisine. So be mindful about what you order. Definitely should try this place out
I've seen the green Jasmine sign a bajillion times driving down the boulevard, and despite even working in an office above the restaurant for a summer when I was 16, I had not found an opportunity to stop in until last night.  I am a newbie to Thai food (gasp?!) and my only other experience was at Taste of Thai on Hertle a few months ago.  I absolutely loved Taste of Thai, so when a friend suggested Jasmine I thought it would be the perfect opportunity to expand my Thai horizons.  :) We ordered the sampler (egg rolls, spring rolls, and tempura veggies with a variety of dipping sauces)--probably wouldn't order again.  nothing wrong with it, but there are other things on the menu I'd like to try.   chicken satay w peanut sauce--the chicken was fried, which was different than other satay I've had.  It was good...the peanut sauce was yummy chicken pad thai--I liked it a lot, especially the over abundance of bean sprouts.  but I remember being more impressed by the pad thai at Taste of Thai.   **...mmm day dreaming about peanut sauce right now...** Ok anyway....One thing I particularly appreciated about Jasmine was the menu.  There were pictures and complete descriptions of everything...whereas during my last Thai food experience I had to rely exclusively on my friends' suggestions because the menu was a little more difficult to read. Next up...King and I (because I see groupons all the time!) ;)
A girl with makeup and the food with MSG is no different. A good makeup attracts attention and MSG gets you addicted to the food you are eating. No wonder the food here will tingle your taste buds but just because a person looks nice doesn't count for being a soulmate. On similar thoughts I would rather be just an admirer to the cuisine here. I still have my better thai favorites that is without MSG, tastes much better and has much better servers !!! Very Important takeaways: 1) KIDS : NOT a kid friendly place at all and i think they are not used to having them at all. No crayons and drawing papers. No kid friendly menu (but you can still share the rice or noodles from your plate ) 2) Large groups: Forget about that....You are excited and you are so involved in your conversations. Slowly when you hear the rumbling sounds from your best friend's tummy , you will realize that people who came after you have been served too !!! Ohh!! yeah don't forget to remind them to serve you too. Also when they get the food , don't forget to remind them that all the main course comes with a small bowl of Rice :)) Well as a first timer we are supposed to know this right????  Best for takeout or smallest group possible !! 3) Not an authentic Thai ! Lets talk Food now: 1) Pad kee mow: rice noodles for vegetarians. Hot is very spicy if you are not a spicy fan. Tastes ok. You can just eat this as a dish 2) Seafood salad: I would say that this was my fav tonight. all seafood medley and nice tangy sauce at bottom. 3) Seafood panag curry: we ordered hot but it was sweet. hmmmm....still tastes fine. 4) Jasmine veg rice: again for spicy pallet, this one hot is good. A simple Veg fried rice . Not so much Thai though.. 5) Tom yum seafood soup:  close to sweet and sour with noodles and seafood medley. Hot did no harm to me as i eat hot spicy food. 6) Hot pepper duck with bamboo shots : Duck has so much fat that if you cook it the fried meat tastes good . This was good with all  the addictive spices 7) Chicken noodles: chicken is not something that you can order here as its not something of their expertise. I rather stick with seafood. SERVICE: For a moment i didn't understand if i was guiding them to serve us or they were my  grumpy neighbors who are not used to kids or were they kids at school making mockery of teachers. Even strangers smile and greet you.
My sister had never tried Thai food before and since I am a Thai food addict, I decided to take her for her first "experience". We arrived to a very friendly staff and were immediately seated and given water. We ordered the spring rolls which were really good (why they even get 2 stars). I decided to order the pad see ew as well (which was called something different there, I think like noddle something) and they had no clue what pad see ew was (bad sign). Then my sister wanted something spicy with chicken so I asked her what she recommended. She couldn't really come up with anything. Then I browsed the menu and saw "Volcano shrimp" which sounded spicy so I asked if we could have the volcano shrimp with chicken instead and she said yes. Well, the food came and the volcano shrimp came with well, shrimp. I told the server that we asked for it with chicken and requested politely  for it to be remade with chicken as my sister does not like shrimp. She got really aggravated and said that I ordered it with shrimp. That makes no sense as I was asking her what is a good chicken dish for my sister to get and then of course ordered the dish and tried to switch it to chicken instead of shrimp. She then told me that they don't do volcano shrimp with chicken. Really?! How hard is it to make a dish with chicken instead of shrimp? Made absolutely no sense. I didn't want to make a scene so I just took my sisters shrimp and gave her half of my chicken. The shrimp was way overcooked and half was burnt. They were inedible. The sauce was okay but pretty bland. My dish was beyond bland. The noodles were sooo sticky and I have had this dish many many times and I really did not enjoy this dish to say the least. I don't know what all the hype is about this restaurant as we dined here specifically because they had good Yelp reviews. I was really disappointed at Jasmine. Maybe I went on an off night? Maybe we went too early? I don't know but I can definitely say that I don't think we will be back.
Their Spicy Fried Rice is so good. I was visiting Buffalo and as soon as I got home, I ordered fried rice from a Thai restaurant and it wasn't good at all. Their Pad Thai was not good at all.
Very consistent and generous portions. I've tried a bunch of thai restaurants and Jasmine has the best pad-thai of them all. Their "special" dishes are a little pricey but all of them are unique and worth a try. They serve BROWN rice! Of all the curries I like the green curry the best, followed by the panang. Their bangkok pasta is also pretty good.
My boyfriend and I come here fairly often.  They have the Thai staples (Pad Thai, Tom Yum Soup, spring rolls etc.) and generally we  try to get something different every time..... but end up always ordering the Bangkok Pasta.  There's this Cantonese phrase that if you translate directly into English it is "wok air", but what it alludes to is the fact that you can taste the heat of the wok.  Which in itself doesn't make sense in English, but the implication is that it is delicious.  So that being said, the Bangkok Pasta is delicious, as are many other dishes. I've had variable experiences with the staff.  Most times they are on point, but other times it takes them awhile to get to the table.  The carpets also look like they haven't been cleaned in a decade and they try to mask it with the dim lighting, but I try to ignore that because the food is good.  Get in there!
I've eaten here a few times and have always enjoyed what I've ordered. Today I ordered take-out for lunch. Got the chicken pad thai, lunch portion. Didn't indicate heat level. And a fresh spring roll. Roll was as good as anywhere. 2 shrimps, noodles, cucumber, cilantro, mint. Peanut sauce on the side for dipping was really robust and had peanuts mixed right in. YUM. The more peanuts the merrier for me!! The pad thai was good. On par with pretty much every other pad thai I've had. Since I didn't indicate heat level, they included a little cup of dried pepper powder that I didn't dare open, since I'm not really a spicy heat person. But I thought that was a nice touch. If you're going to order for take-out over the phone and have a semi difficult name, be prepared to either use an alias or spend many minutes trying to spell your name. "O-I-N..." "No, L, like ELLE, for lollipop..." Eventually there was an f and a g thrown into the spelling but I just gave up at that point. HAHA. Ooof. I didn't think Lindsay was a difficult name to pronounce or spell, but I guess phonetically it's not spoken the way it looks. That damn D. I don't like that their prices aren't on the online menu though. I didn't know what to expect when I showed up. Overall a satisfying meal and a HUGE portion for $11 total.
This is the only Thai restaurant my friends and I have really been to and recommend in Buffalo (or all of WNY for that matter).  They're super busy mostly during dinner times and their dishes are really good overall.  I've had the pad thai and pad kee mao and they're just about as good as anywhere else I've been to on both east and west coasts.  That's saying a lot. I might want to mention that the pad kee mao (drunken noodles) is super hot, so be aware when ordering to specify how hot you want it.  Restaurants have a tendency to avoid making their food as hot as most normal people can handle. I made the mistake of trying the pad kee mao noodle dish, hot (one step below really hot) and OMG it was not as enjoyable as it had been if it was mild, needless to say, I emptied a pitcher of water on myself to keep from exploding in flames. Their spring and summer rolls are excellent too!  A definite must visit if you are here in the area for a weekend and need a suggestion or two.
I don't exactly remember what I ate, so it wasn't an especially memorable experience. The food tasted OK, but don't expect authentic Thai food. They use chile powder in everything when really, they should be using real chiles (you know, the skinny chiles). In Buffalo, I've started to just not expect authentic Asian food. It's weird, because I see Asian owners, but the food just doesn't taste like what I expect. Instead, I just try to accept the Buffalo Asian cuisine as not Asian food, but just a different type of food all in itself.
I used to work around the corner from Jasmine's so I used to frequent there for lunch...a LOT. Anyhow, wish I still did because I don't go as much as I used to & I miss it!  For me, Jasmines, Saigon Cafe & Saigon Bangkok are the best Thai in Buffalo. Hands down!  Our favorites here are: Tom Yum Soup (the best in Buffalo - period), Curry Rolls, Panang Chicken & Green Curry. You can always count on Thai Iced Coffee here (most other places only have Thai Iced Tea). Stop by Jasmines for amazing Thai food, but know ahead of time to not expect wow service, but just what you need. Enough to order, get some drinks and get your bill. Enjoy!
I absolutely hated this place.  The "dumplings" were disgusting.  The duck dish was so over-cooked that before we even tasted it we knew it was well-done to the point of being brown and as hard as a hockey puck! The tastes were not true to Thai food at all.  I've moved here from San Francisco and know what real Asain food should taste like.  This wasn't even a good immitation it was horrific.  I'll never go here again and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone!!!  The spice came from chili powder... let's go back to lesson 101 in Thai cooking people!!! Come on now Buffalo we need some good Thai food!!!
My friends from Buffalo swear that this restaurant serves authentic Thai food but I think it's alright. Been here about three times and I've never really been amazed by what they serve me. The Pad See Eww is always a safe dish but when I came here last time it tasted much more bland than usual. Come here if you really have no other choice..
Finally a place with excellent food and service! Waaaayyyyyy better than any Chinese/Japanese restaurant here! Especially for all the Indians this is just right for us! It's almost like the Indo-Chinese cuisine from back home in India!!! Been there twice and loved it both times!! NO COMPLAINTS!!! The food has different spice levels that one can chose from, from mild to the hottest! Even for the people who love and crave super hot ((Indian level of hotness :P ))food, this is it people!!! All my Indian friends love this place!!! Best part is it's affordable!!! I'm talking student level affordable with a huge quantity that you land up taking some home! Dinner for  two doesnt cost more than $25 and this is including the Entrees!!
Any time I visit Buffalo I make it a point to go to Jasmine at least once. If I'm there for more than a few days I'll enjoy a lunch and dinner. I have been to many Thai restaurants but none better than Jasmine. The waitstaff is friendly and helpful. The food is made fresh with flavors that pop and blend magnificently.
I've been frequenting Jasmine for about 5 years now. And somehow I find myself always coming back every now and then. I've been coming here even when they had the entrance on the other side of the dining hall. Alas, it seems I am less impressed with them than before, that given the current scenario, I am only willing to give them 3 stars. Take our latest visit, for example. It was a Friday evening, and yet it was not crowded at all. There were several staff present, more than enough to handle the amount of diners. And yet, there was the unnecessary wait. Tables weren't cleaned as fast as it should have. We asked for chopsticks, but the request was forgotten that I had to call the attention of another staff for it. Signs of sloppiness were present: when our order of Thai Iced Tea was delivered, together with the waters, the cream used in the iced tea was drizzled on the sides of the water glasses. The food was okay, if not for the less-than-desirable service, I would have given this place 4 stars. But I was not content with the way they handle people, so I removed one star. I am not crossing this off my list, but I would definitely be willing to try some other Thai restaurant and compare.
Definitely not the best thai food ever. Maybe coming from Portland where there is a Thai restaurant on every corner, I'm a little spoiled - but for the prices that this place charges, the quality of Thai food isn't all that great. I've been here three times, once ordering curry, once ordering pad thai, and once ordering pad see ew. The time I ordered curry, it was nothing spectacular, the rice was a little dry/old though - but the price for curry was pretty premium as far as curries go in my opinion. The pad thai and the pad see ew both had rather soggy noodles. The plus side of this place is that if you like spicy foods, they will not hesitate to make it as spicy as you like it. The service is nice. All in all though, it's an OKAY Thai place, but I will probably not be a regular.
Shared spring rolls with my girlfriend who got Bangkok Pasta (if you don't know what you want, definitely try this) and got Shu-shi shrimp myself. The Shu-shi shrimp was definitely up to par, the coconut curry sauce reminded me of my Singaporean neighbor who used to always make similar dishes. I got the mango ice cream for dessert and loved it. It tasted like they just mixed mango and ice together without the sour taste it sometimes accompanies. In terms of the ambiance, it's a nice place for a casual dinner or date.
Great food, great atmosphere, great service!  Whenever I crave thai food, I go here.  You won't be disappointed! I recommend the red curry duck and the tom yum soup.  Mmmmmm....
I went to this place because of enthused Thai-seekers on Yelp having battling opinions on this place versus Taste of Thai.  I ordered take-out for just myself and I usually do a comparison of foods when I try a new place with ethnic cuisine.  I just have to say that the chicken pad thai was many many levels below some of my favorite places both in Buffalo and on Long Island.  I still stick by my word that if you want the best Thai food in Buffalo go to Taste of Thai and not really waste (ok a little harsh) your time with this place.  Noodles were dry,  but more for the cost of the dish but I rather have a sauce that can please than more food in my belly.  Your choice!! But as I trekked a little bit further for take-out I won't be returning!
Been here twice in the last 10 days.  Probably been here a dozen times total, and all I can really talk about is one dish: the panang curry.  I go with chicken, my friends get it with tofu.  I'm not sure what they put in it, maybe crack, it's that addictive.  I don't usually overeat when I go out (sometimes I take half my entree home), but it's like I'm a rat in some experiment where my sense of fullness has been suppressed, and I eat until my stomach bursts and I die (happy).   What i'm trying to say is: get the panang curry.   Service is fine, the price is right (though it's an extra buck for more rice), and rarely a long wait to be seated in my experience.  I enjoy the other Thai places around Buffalo, though I can't claim to know what is more authentic.  I do know that Jasmine has my favorite Asian dish.
Positives: Tons of vegetarian options and the food is really good. The portion sizes are huge, so it always ends up as 2 meals for me. They have a small menu, but every time that I've ever gone here every member of our party has enjoyed what they ordered. They have tons more items on the dinner/take-out menu that I'd like to try. Negatives: The cooks won't customize your meal to your desired level of spiciness. They point you to a canister on the table, which does work but takes a little more effort since the plate is small and they fill it to the brim with food, so it's tough to stir in the additional sauce. We sat right next to a fish tank with a giant eel in it that kept opening it's mouth and making faces at me. Normally, I like fish but this one was just creepy looking... Having just moved here from Cleveland, one of my biggest regrets is leaving behind my favorite Thai place of all time. When my mom came to visit me in CLE last year, I managed to get her hooked on Thai food. Since then, she and I have been on a mission to find the best Thai in Buffalo. We are always taking suggestions on new places to try!
Mediocre Thai food on the main drag in Buffalo. My expectations weren't very high, and they weren't disappointed on two trips here. Which is to say I'd prefer not to have to eat here again if possible. Bland food, even when you ask for it hot. The fantastic chicken, apparently, was not, but they did accomodate my dining partner's weird requests for a totally off-menu item and he was satisfied. He is, however, a sort of human garbage can, and his recommendations cannot be trusted.. They charged for soda refills, which raised my hackles.
Consistent good food. Love the Tom yum shrimp soup, chicken cashew and pad gapow, yum beef. Service is minimal but efficient.
Went there early haloween night after having a LONG and very bad day.  The food was some of the best I can remember!  Had Pad Thai & some appatizer... WOW!  good food!
Ohhhhhh what to do what to do.  Jasmine or Saigon bangkok?  both are on Niagara falls blvd and both are asian of the non WOK-# variety.   I would say Jasmine is more of a Thai / 'chinese' restaurant and Saigon bangkok is more of a Thai / vietnamese restaurant.  both are good, both get 3 stars IMO.   However, when you throw Red Pepper into the mix (just around the corner on Maple, Vietnamese / Chinese), I often choose Red Pepper because I find their prices to be most fair, service is rapid yet warm and food is always fresh.
Jasmine's made me fall in love with panang curry. I had no idea what this was until I ordered it for lunch special here. It was delicious. I like their atmosphere here because it's not a noisy restaurant and on the quiet side, which I like so you're able to hear each other while having a conversation. Their crispy calamari is really good, especially their sauce that comes with it! Lunch special is a reasonable price, on the cheaper side, with pretty good portions.
Up till now, I can't find a restaurant that offers better Thai food than Jasmine Thai. I'm a big fan of their Pad Thai and Bangkok Pasta. I'm from California where the selection of ethnic food, particularly Asian food, is far more diverse than Buffalo, and still I miss their Pad Thai when I go home. So, why didn't I give them a 5 star? Well, the service here is on and off. Some waitresses are ruder than others, but the owner (she seems like it), a Thai lady, is very nice. My resolution for it? Order take-out every time. Their portion is huge, and for a small Asian girl like me, their Pad Thai lasts me three days no joke. I also didn't like the time when I ordered their Thai coffee and asked for it to be less sweet, and the waitress told me that it was "already pre-made" so the sugar level couldn't be changed. When she brought it out, it was clear that the coffee was made by, well, mixing black coffee (still on the bottom) with milk, and clearly the less milk added, the less sweet it would have been. My coffee that day was basically a sweet soup fest. I do blame myself for ordering coffee at a food place, but come on!
Tasty food, good service.
Chicken panang was amazing. FYI - When you say spicy on the Tom Yum soup you get SPICY!!
Pretty good food. Close to horrible service, rude and unorganized. Fried tofu appetizer is up to par, dumpling are kind of dry and the curry is tasty. Food is quite inconsistent. Overall a bit above average 3 starts
For Thai food in Buffalo, I'd say that this place is the best. It used to be a hidden gem in Amherst, but 65 Yelp reviews say otherwise. The only thing that stinks is waiting for a table in a restaurant that doesn't have any standing room.....awkward. I also have a big tolerance for spicy food and their "hot" wasn't hot enough. I'd still go back :)
Late last night we decide to get yet another order of Jasmine's take out.  We share a long time favorite dish, Admiral Shrimp spicy.  Delicious slices of fried eggplant which large tender shrimp, veggies and wonderful sauce (covered in cilantro, YES!). Other favorites include the fried tamarind fish and the ShuShi duck (Duck is a underutilized poultry in the US). Only complaints are that the wait staff isn't very confident and seem flustered especially when they are busy, which they are a lot. We will continue to frequent this place.
Nothing special in terms of Thai food, a lot of my friends rave about it but I did not think much of it. It is pretty expensive compared to the other places you can eat around the area and the food has definitely went down throughout the years. I remember having the Bangkok Pasta(pad see-ew) a few years ago and it was delicious, now it has gotten pretty bland. I am giving it 3 stars because of the pleasant service and the pho here was good. They just can't do Thai food as well as they did before.
I love this place for one reason - my gf introduced me to their pad thai. For a long time I was a really big supporter of Thai Orchid cafe in Williamsville, but this place stole my vote. I think the big difference between the two pad thai's is the sauce. Thai Orchid uses a lighter colored sauce which is very easy on the pallet, but Jasmine's darker more flavorful sauce really brings the dish around full circle. I'm a sucker for pad thai
I ate here as a last meal before boarding a plane to return home, and was a little hesitant as I was afraid the food might be heavy, but it was light and well seasoned! I went there during lunch, and was given the lunch menu. There is an option on the menu which says, "lunch portion" of a dinner dish, so make sure you ask to view the dinner menu as well. I wound up ordering one curry roll and a yum beef salad. The texture of the curry roll was crispy, but the filling could have used more curry spice. The yum beef salad was amazing! There was plenty of cilantro, a large portion of beef and the dressing was delicious. I wish there had been a little more salad because it felt like beef with a side of salad, but it was so good, I can't really complain. My waitress was very attentive, but not overbearing. There is a large parking lot, so driving here is convenient. If I ever visited Buffalo again, I would definitely go to this restaurant!
Came here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon before the boyfriend's flight out of Buffalo. We've been coming here since sophomore (?) year and finally get to review it. This restaurant has a place in our hearts, satisfying our Thai cravings which started at home when we were younger. My go to is always the vegetarian pad thai. It is the standard dish in which we compare all of the new Thai restaurants we try. Jasmine Thai's always comes with fresh raw bean sprouts ("ah-choy" as they say in Cantonese) and ground up peanuts on top. I think that's what puts it a step above others (and why I insist we get it every time.) Also, the rice noodles are usually relatively fresh. This time we also got the Matsuman Curry with steamed tofu. Like others have said, probably not the most "bang for your buck" but it was tasty. The curry sauce is peanuty, salty, and had a kick of spice (ordered it medium) - definitely hit the spot.     The service was good. Our glasses of water were filled promptly and we were asked a couple of times if everything was okay. Just realized, this was most likely our last meal in Buffalo together. (Says something if we chose this restaurant, right?) Until next time, Jasmine Thai (and Buffalo) .. Tear
Best Thai I've ever had...EVER! Service was great and dishes were prepared surprisingly fast for a busy Fri. night. I don't know what these other reviewers are talking about lowered quality, etc. I took my first bite and was floored by the quality and flavors. Just go and see for yourself...
Can't believe I hadn't written a review yet for Jasmine!! I LOVE this restaurant, and I have never been disappointed with the food. The location is a little weird, but I like most of their dishes better than the rest of the thai places around town (I think Papaya has a better pad thai, though). Service isn't 5-star, but you always get exactly what you ordered and after probably close to 40 visits over the last 10 or so years (and lots of take out orders, too), there's never been a mistake. Our stand-bys include the panang chicken, green curry, pad thai, the calamari (soo good) and I love the fresh spring rolls as a quick & cheap lunch. My husbnad also likes the amazing chicken a lot, but it's not for me (a little too rich & heavy on the peanuts!). The thai tea is also SO GOOD! We'll continue to go to jasmine as our stand-by thai fix. If you visit, and you should - say hello to the grumpy fish for me! (You'll know what I mean when you see him.)
I've been to Jasmine several times on separate occasions and have had a good experience. One of the things about ethnic cuisine, is that food is under seasoned for everyone has the ability to enjoy the food. Being Thai, I felt that the noodle dishes could have been more seasoned. The Thai Iced Tea is quite authentic, which I found nice because many places usually water the tea down to save on money. In my experience, the actual thai tea leaves is quite expensive and can only be found in certain thai grocery stores. I would be surprised if the tea was made with a powder instead of the leaves because it tastes (almost) like home. My favorite dish is the duckling, although I've never had "Thai duck" before (Apparently, it's a very popular dish at thai restaurants, but I've never had it while I was in Thailand, nor in my household other than the chinese version) The duckling comes with a side of rice and vegetables with a "black bean sauce". The sauce is quite strong, but I actually love it with the duck. The duck itself is crispy and well seasoned. A few complaints: The homemade icecream (specifically the coconut) could be better. I know it says homemade, and you can definitely taste the coconut cream in it, though you can tell they use some sort of artificial coconut extract. Second: Came here with some friends for my boyfriend's birthday dinner and he had put some of his purchases from the mall on the ground. After the dinner, we walked out of Jasmine and realized that he had forgotten the bag. We walked back in and asked where it was and the waitress had thrown the bag out. This had made no sense to me, especially since there was stuff IN the bag. Why wouldn't you just put it aside in case the customer came back for it? Third: It helps if you speak a little Thai. Many of the staff are Thai/Laos, and I definitely felt a difference in service between myself and my boyfriend's visit vs. my friends and I that are Thai.
I'm from New York City, spent 5 years in Buffalo and a weekend in Phuket, Thailand, and I have to say this is some of the best Thai food I've ever had. Definitely would say its at least one of the best Thai places in Buffalo. I come back everytime I visit Buffalo. I think the taste is right. Thai food is known to be generally really sweet (which I don't like) but Jasmine's isn't and its definintely something that separates them from the competition. The Shu Shi Duck, Tamarind Fish, & Pad Thai (beef) are probably some of my favorites. But theres not too much on the menu that I don't like (I've tried MOST of the food). I think there's definitely something for everyone! Unless your vegetarian...just remember that Fish sauce is a big ingredient in Thai cuisine. So be mindful about what you order. Definitely should try this place out
I've seen the green Jasmine sign a bajillion times driving down the boulevard, and despite even working in an office above the restaurant for a summer when I was 16, I had not found an opportunity to stop in until last night.  I am a newbie to Thai food (gasp?!) and my only other experience was at Taste of Thai on Hertle a few months ago.  I absolutely loved Taste of Thai, so when a friend suggested Jasmine I thought it would be the perfect opportunity to expand my Thai horizons.  :) We ordered the sampler (egg rolls, spring rolls, and tempura veggies with a variety of dipping sauces)--probably wouldn't order again.  nothing wrong with it, but there are other things on the menu I'd like to try.   chicken satay w peanut sauce--the chicken was fried, which was different than other satay I've had.  It was good...the peanut sauce was yummy chicken pad thai--I liked it a lot, especially the over abundance of bean sprouts.  but I remember being more impressed by the pad thai at Taste of Thai.   **...mmm day dreaming about peanut sauce right now...** Ok anyway....One thing I particularly appreciated about Jasmine was the menu.  There were pictures and complete descriptions of everything...whereas during my last Thai food experience I had to rely exclusively on my friends' suggestions because the menu was a little more difficult to read. Next up...King and I (because I see groupons all the time!) ;)
A girl with makeup and the food with MSG is no different. A good makeup attracts attention and MSG gets you addicted to the food you are eating. No wonder the food here will tingle your taste buds but just because a person looks nice doesn't count for being a soulmate. On similar thoughts I would rather be just an admirer to the cuisine here. I still have my better thai favorites that is without MSG, tastes much better and has much better servers !!! Very Important takeaways: 1) KIDS : NOT a kid friendly place at all and i think they are not used to having them at all. No crayons and drawing papers. No kid friendly menu (but you can still share the rice or noodles from your plate ) 2) Large groups: Forget about that....You are excited and you are so involved in your conversations. Slowly when you hear the rumbling sounds from your best friend's tummy , you will realize that people who came after you have been served too !!! Ohh!! yeah don't forget to remind them to serve you too. Also when they get the food , don't forget to remind them that all the main course comes with a small bowl of Rice :)) Well as a first timer we are supposed to know this right????  Best for takeout or smallest group possible !! 3) Not an authentic Thai ! Lets talk Food now: 1) Pad kee mow: rice noodles for vegetarians. Hot is very spicy if you are not a spicy fan. Tastes ok. You can just eat this as a dish 2) Seafood salad: I would say that this was my fav tonight. all seafood medley and nice tangy sauce at bottom. 3) Seafood panag curry: we ordered hot but it was sweet. hmmmm....still tastes fine. 4) Jasmine veg rice: again for spicy pallet, this one hot is good. A simple Veg fried rice . Not so much Thai though.. 5) Tom yum seafood soup:  close to sweet and sour with noodles and seafood medley. Hot did no harm to me as i eat hot spicy food. 6) Hot pepper duck with bamboo shots : Duck has so much fat that if you cook it the fried meat tastes good . This was good with all  the addictive spices 7) Chicken noodles: chicken is not something that you can order here as its not something of their expertise. I rather stick with seafood. SERVICE: For a moment i didn't understand if i was guiding them to serve us or they were my  grumpy neighbors who are not used to kids or were they kids at school making mockery of teachers. Even strangers smile and greet you.
My sister had never tried Thai food before and since I am a Thai food addict, I decided to take her for her first "experience". We arrived to a very friendly staff and were immediately seated and given water. We ordered the spring rolls which were really good (why they even get 2 stars). I decided to order the pad see ew as well (which was called something different there, I think like noddle something) and they had no clue what pad see ew was (bad sign). Then my sister wanted something spicy with chicken so I asked her what she recommended. She couldn't really come up with anything. Then I browsed the menu and saw "Volcano shrimp" which sounded spicy so I asked if we could have the volcano shrimp with chicken instead and she said yes. Well, the food came and the volcano shrimp came with well, shrimp. I told the server that we asked for it with chicken and requested politely  for it to be remade with chicken as my sister does not like shrimp. She got really aggravated and said that I ordered it with shrimp. That makes no sense as I was asking her what is a good chicken dish for my sister to get and then of course ordered the dish and tried to switch it to chicken instead of shrimp. She then told me that they don't do volcano shrimp with chicken. Really?! How hard is it to make a dish with chicken instead of shrimp? Made absolutely no sense. I didn't want to make a scene so I just took my sisters shrimp and gave her half of my chicken. The shrimp was way overcooked and half was burnt. They were inedible. The sauce was okay but pretty bland. My dish was beyond bland. The noodles were sooo sticky and I have had this dish many many times and I really did not enjoy this dish to say the least. I don't know what all the hype is about this restaurant as we dined here specifically because they had good Yelp reviews. I was really disappointed at Jasmine. Maybe I went on an off night? Maybe we went too early? I don't know but I can definitely say that I don't think we will be back.
Their Spicy Fried Rice is so good. I was visiting Buffalo and as soon as I got home, I ordered fried rice from a Thai restaurant and it wasn't good at all. Their Pad Thai was not good at all.
Very consistent and generous portions. I've tried a bunch of thai restaurants and Jasmine has the best pad-thai of them all. Their "special" dishes are a little pricey but all of them are unique and worth a try. They serve BROWN rice! Of all the curries I like the green curry the best, followed by the panang. Their bangkok pasta is also pretty good.
My boyfriend and I come here fairly often.  They have the Thai staples (Pad Thai, Tom Yum Soup, spring rolls etc.) and generally we  try to get something different every time..... but end up always ordering the Bangkok Pasta.  There's this Cantonese phrase that if you translate directly into English it is "wok air", but what it alludes to is the fact that you can taste the heat of the wok.  Which in itself doesn't make sense in English, but the implication is that it is delicious.  So that being said, the Bangkok Pasta is delicious, as are many other dishes. I've had variable experiences with the staff.  Most times they are on point, but other times it takes them awhile to get to the table.  The carpets also look like they haven't been cleaned in a decade and they try to mask it with the dim lighting, but I try to ignore that because the food is good.  Get in there!
I've eaten here a few times and have always enjoyed what I've ordered. Today I ordered take-out for lunch. Got the chicken pad thai, lunch portion. Didn't indicate heat level. And a fresh spring roll. Roll was as good as anywhere. 2 shrimps, noodles, cucumber, cilantro, mint. Peanut sauce on the side for dipping was really robust and had peanuts mixed right in. YUM. The more peanuts the merrier for me!! The pad thai was good. On par with pretty much every other pad thai I've had. Since I didn't indicate heat level, they included a little cup of dried pepper powder that I didn't dare open, since I'm not really a spicy heat person. But I thought that was a nice touch. If you're going to order for take-out over the phone and have a semi difficult name, be prepared to either use an alias or spend many minutes trying to spell your name. "O-I-N..." "No, L, like ELLE, for lollipop..." Eventually there was an f and a g thrown into the spelling but I just gave up at that point. HAHA. Ooof. I didn't think Lindsay was a difficult name to pronounce or spell, but I guess phonetically it's not spoken the way it looks. That damn D. I don't like that their prices aren't on the online menu though. I didn't know what to expect when I showed up. Overall a satisfying meal and a HUGE portion for $11 total.
This is the only Thai restaurant my friends and I have really been to and recommend in Buffalo (or all of WNY for that matter).  They're super busy mostly during dinner times and their dishes are really good overall.  I've had the pad thai and pad kee mao and they're just about as good as anywhere else I've been to on both east and west coasts.  That's saying a lot. I might want to mention that the pad kee mao (drunken noodles) is super hot, so be aware when ordering to specify how hot you want it.  Restaurants have a tendency to avoid making their food as hot as most normal people can handle. I made the mistake of trying the pad kee mao noodle dish, hot (one step below really hot) and OMG it was not as enjoyable as it had been if it was mild, needless to say, I emptied a pitcher of water on myself to keep from exploding in flames. Their spring and summer rolls are excellent too!  A definite must visit if you are here in the area for a weekend and need a suggestion or two.
I don't exactly remember what I ate, so it wasn't an especially memorable experience. The food tasted OK, but don't expect authentic Thai food. They use chile powder in everything when really, they should be using real chiles (you know, the skinny chiles). In Buffalo, I've started to just not expect authentic Asian food. It's weird, because I see Asian owners, but the food just doesn't taste like what I expect. Instead, I just try to accept the Buffalo Asian cuisine as not Asian food, but just a different type of food all in itself.
I used to work around the corner from Jasmine's so I used to frequent there for lunch...a LOT. Anyhow, wish I still did because I don't go as much as I used to & I miss it!  For me, Jasmines, Saigon Cafe & Saigon Bangkok are the best Thai in Buffalo. Hands down!  Our favorites here are: Tom Yum Soup (the best in Buffalo - period), Curry Rolls, Panang Chicken & Green Curry. You can always count on Thai Iced Coffee here (most other places only have Thai Iced Tea). Stop by Jasmines for amazing Thai food, but know ahead of time to not expect wow service, but just what you need. Enough to order, get some drinks and get your bill. Enjoy!
I absolutely hated this place.  The "dumplings" were disgusting.  The duck dish was so over-cooked that before we even tasted it we knew it was well-done to the point of being brown and as hard as a hockey puck! The tastes were not true to Thai food at all.  I've moved here from San Francisco and know what real Asain food should taste like.  This wasn't even a good immitation it was horrific.  I'll never go here again and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone!!!  The spice came from chili powder... let's go back to lesson 101 in Thai cooking people!!! Come on now Buffalo we need some good Thai food!!!
My friends from Buffalo swear that this restaurant serves authentic Thai food but I think it's alright. Been here about three times and I've never really been amazed by what they serve me. The Pad See Eww is always a safe dish but when I came here last time it tasted much more bland than usual. Come here if you really have no other choice..
Finally a place with excellent food and service! Waaaayyyyyy better than any Chinese/Japanese restaurant here! Especially for all the Indians this is just right for us! It's almost like the Indo-Chinese cuisine from back home in India!!! Been there twice and loved it both times!! NO COMPLAINTS!!! The food has different spice levels that one can chose from, from mild to the hottest! Even for the people who love and crave super hot ((Indian level of hotness :P ))food, this is it people!!! All my Indian friends love this place!!! Best part is it's affordable!!! I'm talking student level affordable with a huge quantity that you land up taking some home! Dinner for  two doesnt cost more than $25 and this is including the Entrees!!
