Great bait and tackle shop that meets all your needs for fishing in the Jensen Beach area.  Great service and knowledge of the local area. Webcasts posted on there website gives great insight into the current fishing conditions.
A FIRST CLASS BAIT SHOP One of the best attractions is : n the parking lot :Fredgies Hot Dog Wagon Hours for food: Wed.-Sun. 11 a.m.-4 p.m. (Not there Mon.-Tues.) Entertainment: Watching Fred cook your dog. Dockage: Several hundred feet of dock available adjacent to the parking lot. Atmosphere: Fred and Regina Beauchene have parked their hot-dog wagon at the same spot five days a week for the past 14 years. Their occupational license requires that the hot-dog stand be moved off the premises each day for at least eight hours. Interesting menu items: Sausage and peppers hot dog.
The worst customer service, they are racist and do not welcome children, if you have a family do not go to this place.
A Jensen Beach landmark. This is a required stop before any local fishing trip. You can walk in a tourist and walk out ready to catch the big one.
If your just driving down Indian River drive, stop at this place if you want a feel of old Florida. Overlooking the river just a cool place to get a coke or a new reel.
This place has been the bait shop in the area since the 1949. The guys are great. Very knowledgeable and happy to assist. Whether you need all new gear or fresh bait or just great local advise this is the place.
Super helpful place, much recommended
Henry and his ever changing staff are great.  Without a doubt the BEST place to get fishing tips,  find out what's biting, what's the hot lure and buy your gear...reasonable pricing and will always match the big box stores...
Great bait and tackle store!  Very friendly and professional staff.
best bait and tackle in town
