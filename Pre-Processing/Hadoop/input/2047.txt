This place hands down is my most visited place in WNY. There are great specials throughout the week, especially during trivia/bingo on Wed.  Can anyone say 7.50 well drink pitchers? Also the food here is pretty amazing.  It's your typical bar food, but their buffalo chicken wrap is to die for, and dare I say the best chicken wings in Buffalo. Nina, Jen, and Jill are all great bartenders, and help make the place friendly, and what Buffalo is all about.
"What the F#*K" Burger"!!!  SERIOUSLY!  It's on the menu and we ordered it.  I never would have, but when you're dining with a 15 year old boy (ummmm....man?) you have to be open to such things.  And...WOW!  It was pretty darn good. Last night my son and I joined two friends at "Average Joe's".   The place was hoppin' , the service was great, and the menu was much larger than I anticipated.... lots of salads and wings and sandwiches and wraps and a WHOLE PAGE of burgers.  Now I would have ordered something "dainty" (yeah, right) like a chicken salad or a turkey wrap..... but once my son spied that "What the F#*K Burger" he HAD to have it. Two quarter pound patties, cole slaw, cheese, chicken fingers (!!), mozzarella sticks, onion rings, and lettuce and tomato (for health, I guess).  He asked for no bacon (no pork for us, thanks) and the waitress told us they were out of the macaroni salad that also goes on this creation.  Oh well.... it was hardly missed (well...maybe a little...I love that stuff).  And, it was served with french fries and a pickle. I didn't order anything for me since I thought that there was NO WAY the kid could eat so much.  I figured we'd share. I guess I underestimated the appetite of a fifteen year old guy.  Sure I had a teeny-tiny bite of each layer (he carefully attacked it with a knife and fork as not to risk losing a drip or two).... and each layer tasted better than the previous one.  And, the pickle (my sole possession) was quite tasty.   The kid DEVOURED it.... told me it was DELICIOUS... said next time we're not "sharing".... and proceeded to eat a dozen cookies and a huge glass of milk when we got home (for dessert)!
TRIVIA NIGHT here on Wednesdays are very fun and gets crowded (hosted by DJ Trivia - the same guy that hosts Thirsty Buffalo trivia on Tuesdays?).  The game has an advertised 7 pm start but the fun doesn't really start till 715 or so but either way you will want to go early and secure a table.  The drink specials are $7 well mixed drinks (pitcher) or $7 Blue or Light Blue pitchers during Trivia Night. There is a mixed crowd here otherwise.  UB students and locals.  The place gets packed during game nights.
Amazing food, and the bartenders can pretty much make anything you're in the mood for.
This is by far my most visited bar in Buffalo. The drink specials throughout the week are great! My favorite is probably flip night on Tuesdays but I still have to go out and try the trivia Wednesdays.
Don't let the well worn floors and walls turn you away. This was perhaps my 8th visit to Average Joe's which, time and again, has proved to be a damn fun place to hang with my friends. Music, bands, acoustic guitars, tons of space and creative bar food bring me back again and again.
Giving this "used to be great" place 2 stars breaks my heart. Sigh! I used to love this place, until a really rude guy who's a friend of the owner started hanging out every night and they turn off the jukebox after 10 pm. Yet, there really loud music playing which isn't from the jukebox and upon being requested to turn on the jukebox, this idiot dictates what music is played in the bar. Furthermore, the quality of food has deteriorated considerably since I first started coming here in April of 2014. Please be advised that I've been here more than 8 times, just didn't bother to check in every time. I can tell something is amiss but I love all the bartenders to death, they're awesome people stuck in a workplace that's going downhill FAST! If you see a medium height, chubby douche acting like he's the owner (yet he's not), walk to him and show this review. Maybe he'll come back to his senses.
I came here for the first time in my senior year back in 2007. I think after 3 weeks, I was pretty much a regular. Bartenders were awesome. Each of the 3 owners are great guys and pretty cool. Abbot? Abbin? Whatever his name is, is a really cool guy. I know I'm reviewing this place like 5  years after I've graduated by I've spent a good deal of time here. The college nights are pretty awesome. Their patty melt is the best I've ever had in my life. The bartenders were always on point and fantastic. I remember there was a few nights where my shots were comp'd by owners. Actually, it happened a lot since I used to even do my homework here. Go figure. I had plenty of great nights, bonding time with people and experiences at this bar. 5/5 for everything. Nothing average about this place.
We go every week for trivia, though recently service has been sub par. The loss of our favorite bartender has impacted our experiences there. Some nights the bartenders clearly forget about us; I realize the bar itself is busy, but there is always a crowd on Wed, why don't they have a 3rd bartender working? Hoping they get it together, it is our preferred spot for Wed trivia. Updated menu is decent  - wing sauces are good, mozz sticks are good, some of the burgers are good.
Sorry have to say we were disappointed last night. We had 45 people on a bus for a pub crawl. We stopped there and the kid at the door bounced us. Big mistake, you guys missed out on a lot of cash and fun.
Great Wings and fries but terrible burgers and Irish whiskey selection. I wouldn't go here if I didn't live by it.
The selling point, for me, about Average Joe's is that it's really good at living up to its name. This place is extremely average. If there was an option for 2.5 stars, I'd give it that just to emphasize its average status. Typical townie bar with a college crowd fused with locals. If you like average bars and you're looking for average night out in Amherst, this is your place.
How does this bar only have 3.5 stars?  It's a classic local bar with darts, pool and megatouch; what more could you want?  The owner is frequently there and sets high standards for the food.  They offer a vast selection of liquors, including two of my favorite vodkas: Ruby Red and Purple.  The bartenders are helpful, fast and nice.  Nina is the best!!  There's also a smoking patio out back.   It's one of the few cool bars in the 'burbs.  Weekday nights are the best, as weekends can get crowded with drunk college kids.  They even have a side room great for private parties.
Can't believe I'm the first person to review this place out of all the people who have spent their entire college years at Average Joe's.  If you live off campus, this will be your typical hangout place.  It could be walking distance to campus if you're determined enough, about 45 min.  Average Joe's is your typical townie bar with great prices, great location, great memories, and great patio outside.  Too bad they rarely use it in buffalo.  They have karaoke night, billiards table, and tv's.  If you go to UB, chances are you will come here, no way around it.  You can be an absolute hermit and still find yourself here, sorry, but it's gonna happen
