I really love Thai food. Since I moved to the area, this is the closest place to get some.  Ice been here with friends and we've also done takeout. I wish I could write a better review... Good quality ingredients but inconsistent flavors take away from what would be my favorite restaurant.   Avoid the Pad Thai.
***for the new kenmore ave location*** I was totally perplexed when after driving by the restaurant on kenmore ave i was unable to find it in a search on google or yelp.  until i went the the website for the north tonawanda location i was beginning the think i had imagined it.... ' after confirming that it was there and actually a new second location for the north tonawanda business we checked it out for a late lunch.  it is in fact pretty new; they are still waiting on a liquor license and the food inspector stopped by to take more pictures of the kitchen.  they did allow us to byob which was a plus.  the decor was interesting with floor to ceiling wood paneling and furnishings that kind of made me think of cracker barrel but with embroidered asian things on the wall.  the woman's bathroom also had no hand towels but toilet paper rolls left on the sink counter.  that being said, it's really about the food, right? we ordered the spring rolls, peanut king and street noodles. spring rolls were good but ive had better. the entrees were very good but the street noodles were a bit salty (and i am not a salt sensitive person). as mentioned by another reviewer, the heat levels are mild.  i ordered hot and it was maybe medium. the special thai dishes were also on the pricey side but the stir-fries, rice dishes etc were competetively priced. portion sizes are reasonable. hits and misses but i will definitely be back to try other items on the menu, especially some of the dishes that i havent seen elsewhere in the city at other thai establishments. and they deliver!
Very good food! My boyfriend and I were the only people in the place though. I was surprised! We had the calamari, fresh summer rolls, and the seafood dish in the clay pot. Everything was very good and I'm excited to bring my friends there next time. A hidden gem for sure!!
Please note: the rating is based solely on the taste of the food. My husband and I stopped in last Friday evening for dinner around 7:00 pm. Dinner prime time right? Not at Yummy Thai. We had the restaurant all to ourselves but I wondered how do these people stay in business if we are the only couple in here on a Friday evening? Then I found out how, their food is delicious! Let's just say, the atmosphere leaves much to be desired. The dining room is very small and the staff pretty much all stands around the cash register and stares at you while you are dining. The music is quiet and without other patrons, its safe to say they are also listening in on your conversation, awkward. There was also a leak coming from the ceiling nearby which made for an annoying "drip, drip" sound the entire time. Anyways, we started off the dinner with a calamari appetizer which was delicious. Great portion and came out of the kitchen very quickly after placing the order, this most likely had something to do with us being the only customers at the present time. For my main course, I ordered the shrimp pud thai - medium & my husband ordered the sesame chicken. We were both extremely pleased with our dinners and left with full bellies! Before leaving the restaurant I made sure to grab a take out menu since I think that is the only way Yummy Thai is going to stay in business. They definitely need to do some work on the "dining in" experience!
Really inconsistent place. The spiciness levels change day to day. We then received a cockroach in our food, and management really didn't do too much to remedy the problem. They removed Facebook listings, so I figured I would post here.
All I can say is that I'm extremely disappointed, especially considering the wealth of positive reviews this place has here. My girlfriend and I each ordered the Tom Yum soup, the flavors were underwhelming. While it did have a nice kick to it, there was none of the sourness one would expect from Tom Yum. For the entrees I had the street noodle, while she had the Pad Kee Mow. Again the flavors were largely underdeveloped and synthetic. The street noodle was plain, and had no heat even with ordering it hot. The Pad Kee Mow tasted as if the base of the sauce was made with ketchup, with no heat despite it being "super hot". Think Thai food made in a bad, Chinese take-out style. To be simply put, the prices are cheap, and the flavors/quality reflect it. Very disappointed, with better Thai places nearby, won't be returning to this one.
Meh. This place is ok. Food is good. Could be cleaner. I went day after Fourth of July and they wouldn't honor lunch specials because of holiday? What? It's kind of overpriced, but it's reliable and extra spicy. Lack of stars is due to attitude from owner....she is a tough cookie with no sense of customer service.
This is my new go-to spot for Thai in WNY -- it  used to be Thai Orchid.  This is about as close to eating in Thailand as you're gonna get in the area.  I highly suggest the Street Noodles with Tofu.  This is one of the few places that knows how to do tofu so it's actually flavorful. Thanks for the great service and experience.  We will definitely be back.

I'm catching up with my reviews lately and I always like to make it a point to review a place I have a fond liking for. I have tried a few items on their menu and each time the flavor is tasty and delicious. This is my go to Thai restaurant. I've tried others in the area and although some have been fairly good. I like how tasty the food is here and when I finish eating I'm always left wanting more.  The location itself is very casual and laid back. It's a nice lunch destination as well as dinner.

I hate being "that person" but... we walked in shortly after 8pm and were the only ones in the restaurant. The waited was very nice and attentive. However, I received chicken fried rice instead of beef fried rice. And I was charged for beef fried rice. I brought it to the waiters attention and he adjusted it for us, no problem. The rice was well,  lackluster. It was mushy over cooked and didn't look fried.  My friends dish was street noodles w chicken. I don't care for peanut sauce but he liked it.

WOW. This place is great! Everything looks so healthy and you have different "meat" options: Chicken, Beef, Pork, Tofu. The prices seem a little bit pricey for me, or maybe I'm just cheap. For those extra dollars added on, I expect a little more food on the plate. Otherwise I have no complaints. The service is very friendly and helpful. I believe they have one or two waiters around. (It's a small place) The wait for food isn't very long either. When our food came out, omg it looked so tasty and smelled amazing! My boyfriend got the Healthy Garlic and I got the Panang Curry. Also, you can choose your "Level" of spiceyness. My boyfriend got Extra Hot and I got Medium. I didn't think they were so bad. Medium was like eating normal food. I'll get Extra Hot next time. The food is definitely YUMMAAYY!!! Rice is delicious and cooked perfectly. The curry sauce was very tastey. and didn't overpower the veggies either! My only wish is that they could use "loose leaf" tea instead of bagged tea in their pots. I ordered Jasmine tea and had to wait a while before it steeped. At first it was very light and then got progressively darker through the meal. I definitely need to come back to this place ASAP! It's a great option for vegans & vegetarians because it offers healthy options and alternatives to meat products.

I was very impressed with this casual-yet-chic Thai eatery in the heart of North Tonawanda's surprisingly diverse business district along Webster (also boasting the Riviera Theater and American Skin Art, among a variety of other local businesses). Ambiance - The atmosphere was layed back but with a mild touch of ethnic-inspired sophistication - simple furniture was set off with little embellishments, like brocade curtains. The entire place looked spotless and the space was well laid out to accomodate a maximum number of diners in the medium sized space. Service - Our waitress could only be described as bubbly - super friendly, with a huge, radiant smile, she was even giggly. She was truly a joy - prompt, seemed genuinely interested in our thoughts on the cuisine, but didn't overstay her welcome. Water was always full, food, check and take out containers came out in a timely fashion. Food - I started with an appetizer of "golden triangles" - basically crab rangoons, but with a slightly flakier wrapper than typical of Chinese cuisine and what seemed to be (oh my) real crab mixed in with the delicately spiced cream cheese filling. Served with a mild dipping sauce, they were super tasty and perfectly done (not greasy, burnt or smooshy - because basically everywhere but Chang Garden f++ks up my rangoons!). My friend and I both got an eggplant and mixed vegetable dish, myself with mixed seafood (squid, shrimp, etc) and he with mixed meat (pork, chicken, beef); we requested a spice level between mild and medium. I'm not a huge fan of heat, but I love the flavor that comes with spicier Asian foods (as opposed to the heat sans flavor of ultra hot chicken wings or similar foods in traditional American cuisine). Mild often doesn't give me any of that and medium is too much, particularly with cuisines like Thai and Indian that favor heat in a lot of their dishes. The spice level was dead on - just those few steps before it became too spicy but bursting with flavor. The seafood and eggplant were the perfect textures, the latter showing the bright purple skin typical of Japanese eggplant (versus the darker skinned variety you typically get at the grocery store). All the other veggies in the dish were crisp, without being underdone, and the sauce was zesty and flavorful without being too sweet or too salty. The jasmine rice was hot, plentiful and fluffy. My only complaint is that I forgot my leftovers in the trunk of my car overnight and had to, with a tear in my eye, throw them out. I would definitely drive the distance to this place again from my home in northwest Buffalo, particularly when coupled with the fun shopping I engaged in nearby at Cats Like Us and the surrounding area on Main Street in Tonawanda.

It was good, I can't eat most of what they cook since I am allergic to all things from the sea. But what I ate was good. The service is good but one gross thing bothered me a great deal. Not sure if he's the owner, he was a mature man and had access to the kitchen so I assume he was part of the staff at the very least. I was sitting by the rear of the dining area near the kitchen. This person was about 3-4 feet from me and proceeded to cough endlessly it seemed, in reality it was a few seconds but when your eating a disturbance always seems longer. Ahh ha now I get the theory of relativity..This behavior is unacceptable in the States whilst dining, he should have excused himself outside or to the restroom.  Again the dining experience aside from the man with influenza was very good. I would refer them to others just avoid the hacking man.

Highly recommend Yummy Thai if you are in the Niagara Falls area, as the restaurant choices in NF are pretty slim unless you want Chinese or Indian food every night. My family of 4 includes 2 vegans and a vegetarian, so we searched Yelp for Thai and found this place. It was worth the drive.The food was fresh and delicious, beautifully plated and included tasty Jasmine rice. The Mutsamun Curry, Pineapple Fried Rice and Peanut King entrees were excellent, as was the  Green Garden Stir Fry with Chicken. The wine list was impressive for such a small restaurant, and they also had various beers available. We live in the Philadelphia suburbs and eat Thai food often; Yummy Thai would be at the top of our list of favorites if it were closer to home!

Surprisingly good - I'm fairly new to the area and had tried the "top rated" Thai places from Urban Spoon only to be really disappointed. we tried this on a whim expecting to be disappointed again, but it's really good. Also, there's a good ice cream shop a few doors up the street!

Visiting family that is local to this area. I live on the West Coast that has an abundance of ethnic restaurants and usually when I come back I avoid them at all costs and usually opt for Italian, pizza, or subs which is not well executed where I live. I'm glad my brother suggested that we order take-out from here. I was put in charge and we ordered shrimp summer rolls, Tom Yum soup, apple salad, Pad Thai, & Panang curry. It was all tasty, but the Tom Yum soup didn't have the flavor I expected. It was pricey, but typical for where I'm from.

This is a cute little Thai restaurant in North Tonawanda that has really yummy food.  The pud thai is great, but not the best I've ever had.  It is a little overpriced though.  The service is usually decent, but tonight it was extremely slow, and they were not even busy.  I would really like to try some of their other dishes sometime.  The soup here is healthy and delicious.  They have good deals on glasses of wine too.  The menu is extensive, and there are a lot of choices.

Ate here twice, once for dinner, once for lunch.  Delicious food!  Good service.  Pricey on the downside.  I recommend the "street noodles" and the papaya salad.  Interesting desserts!  They do serve alcohol if that is important to you.  Easy to find.

Went on July 26, 2013. Why aren't more folks finding this jewel? Quiet, good for a meal with conversation. Food is clean, unfettered, nicely balanced. We will return and will suggest to others who like a place to eat where the food is the most important part.

A hidden gem in North Tonawanda.  I tried sake here for the first time and the waiter seemed to be knowledgable about it, as he recommended that I go for the traditional kind and have it warmed up.  The sake was very smooth and I could see this as being a great drink on a cold night.  I ordered the street noodle with tofu and it was amazing.  I went to dinner with a small appetite but ended up finishing the dish because it was so tasty.  I went on a Monday night and was the only customer there.  I hope this wasn't the norm as I would like to see this place stay open.

Took a chance to visit this Thai restaurant as was bored with all the Indian options around the place.  Ordered chicken curry puff which was yummy, thai fried rice which was good and red curry which was ok ( have had better ones back in NJ). Was happy with the quantity offered; in fact could not finish it all. It is about 15 mins away in the Tonawanda downtown area and definitely worth the drive.

Read one review and can't agree more. Haven't had any bad meals in that restaurant! Having a high quality Thai restaurant on the street of walking distance from my house is a true gift in life. The only thing puzzling to me is that each time I go there, it seems I am the only table there. They seem to get better business nowadays.
