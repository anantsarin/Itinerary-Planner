We all know that the bun makes the burger. Here, the bun indeed makes the burger but you can get the same elsewhere. All in all, the burger is good too. Great? Sure. Spectacular? Sorry, it fails to make a lasting impression. My friend raved about this place for the past 3-4 years I have known him. He went to Cornell and I finally managed to visit him as he was being wedded there. So I had to get a burger. The thing that I appreciate about this burger joint was that it does NOT overcook the patties. +1 in addition, the fries are very crispy +1 again. size? It's decent size. Don't worry, you will get full here. I think that's the general consensus amongst my friends who had dinner with me. If you are curious as to what I got, I got the Big Sexy. It was alright.
This is a solid Brew Pub with decent food. Most of the times when you go to a bar all you get is glorified bar food. That means, if you can fry it, they'll serve it. They're counting on you drinking a fair amount which ends up masking your experience of how bad the food usually is. However, IAH was a diamond in the rough. So, we tried IAH again for the 2nd time this past Saturday so we could drink some decent beers, eat some decent food, and watch the UGA / USC game on ESPN. Street parking is dicey and metered at all times, but fortunately we were hoofing it from our hotel. When we arrived there were a fair amount of people waiting in and around the door, so the place was pretty crowded. The service is SLOW here...so just understand that when going here. Have a beer at the bar, because they're certainly not going to rush to get you in a booth or at a table. I'd give them a 2 for service getting you seated, and then maybe a 3 for service once you're seated. Just average service. They changed the t.v.'s for us so we could watch a decent game...come on SU...your football program is terrible and that was the only real football game on in there, besides a blow-out between Alabama and whoever they were playing, accompanied by some tennis (LAME on a Sat. College Football night). Anyways, bellied up to the bar and got a couple of drinks to wait out a table. Finally got seated, and we ordered the pretzels as an appetizer (not on the regular menu) and they were good, but a bit expensive (~$8.00) with mustard. You got 4 of them and they tied us over till we could get our meal, but still a bit pricey. There are better appetizers available. For dinner, I had the Bastard Burger ($11 - Black pepper crusted burger topped with an onion ring and spicy homemade "Arrogant Bastard Brown Ale" mustard - cooked medium) with onion rings, while my wife had the California Chicken Wrap ($9 - Grilled chicken, sun-dried tomatoes, grilled vegetables, spinach, Goat cheese, and avocado cream sauce). They cooked my burger as ordered, which surprisingly, most restaurants screw up, and it was good, but the mustard was super spicy. Think that spicy mustard they serve at Chinese restaurants. The buns that the burgers are served on are excellent. Anyways, burger was good, I just wouldn't get that version again since it was so spicy. My wife enjoyed her California Chicken Wrap, but it wasn't really my thing, so I won't weigh in on it. As a whole, IAH is a solid bar with good food and decent beer prices. I'd definitely come back the next time I'm in Ithaca.
Food is good enough. However, the service is really terrible. When we entered the place, we were not asked where we'd like to be seated- outside or in the restaurant. Since we didn't mind that much, we were tucked in the back. It took maybe half-an-hour or more to get our food ready. It wasn't as if the place is busy either. We didn't get a heads up about the wait. We got different kinds of burger on our table. I found out I still like the classic burger the best. The burger with brie and apple is good though. Onion rings is really good. It is also nice that you are allowed to split the tab.
3.5 Stars. The Ithaca Ale House is stuck in an awkward location in the commons.  It's right on restaurant row, but at the same time is an ale house that doesn't quite attract the typical college crowd like the rest of the bars in that area.  So it's good to avoid the crowd, get some drinks there, and dinner, but for pizza and burgers it's a little pricey, especially with the other options just down the way.  But it's definitely a lot cleaner and cozier than the bar competitors, and often has  live music which is really nice and one of the few places  (if any) left in commons that has bands play. Overall, it's always a good time, a little pricey, but a good selection of beers and good music too!
Solid burger, and a reasonable beer list. Not beer snob worthy, but definitely better than your average bar. Step one in expanding one's beer horizons. I was especially amused by the "beginner's" beer tasting sampler ("Did you know their were different styles of beer??"). I'd come back, but wouldn't go out of the way for it.
Big restaurant, sort of dark, but it has a very cozy/friendly feel to it.  We waited a bit to be seated.  We sidled into our booth and waited to place our orders. The menu is pretty extensive and you can get pretty much anything here. I ordered the Big Sexy burger and it was pretty huge and a bit difficult to eat. The burger patty was cooked extremely well. Also tried the flatbread pizza here, which was really good. As I've graduated and am no longer in Ithaca, I would love to visit again and try some of their ales.
A great burger cooked perfectly med rare as requested.  A little dry but overall a really good burger.
A little pricey but a decent selection of beers and tasty flatbread pizzas.   I'd stop by here again if I was craving a brew and starving from hiking in the state parks all day.

Really had a great experience at the Ithaca Ale House today!  The nachos were delicious with fresh pico de gallo and great guacamole!  We all ordered their burgers--which is what they are known for besides their extraordinary amount of beers on tap--two Perfect Burgers and a build your own (BYOBurger) with blue cheese.  Everyone went away stuffed and happy! The waitress was pleasant, quick to get our order, but a little lax on filling up the water/sodas.   It was early so we didn't get any beers.   Food was excellent.

Burgers were mediocre at best. ithaca must be a burger wasteland for this place to get accolades.  patty was not seasoned, tasted like nothing, and had an unpleasant mushy/pasty texture despite being cooked past my requested medium rare.  appetizer size burgers tasted a little better but were even more overcooked and the rolls they were served on were too hard/bready.  pork belly slider appetizer was also not great, as the pork belly was cooked in such a way that it had a texture more like canadian bacon than the tenderness i typically expect from a pork belly dish. got the onion rings as a side and they were okay, not terrible but not great either. great beer selection and good service though.

This is a nice modern designed pub with quite a few beers to choose from on tap and then several others in bottle form. There is wide range of dinners and your usual array of pub fare. I suggest the burgers. This is a good place in town to get a tasty, juicy hamburger. Also, if you have space left, be sure to leave a little room for deep fried brownie. It's a great dessert to split among a few friends. It's a little much for one person to take on their own (unless they skipped dinner altogether.)

Stopped in on my way back to NYC for a quick bite.   Good burgers (fresh meat, big patties) SLOOOOOWWW service.

This place was recommended by the front desk at the new Fairfield Inn & Suites in Ithaca. I wasn't disappointed at all. Great selection of beers on draught. The bartender was very friendly and helpful with suggestions. I had the buffalo spring rolls which were very tasty as well as filling. Their local ales were excellent. Nice selection.

It's a decent burger place. I got a BLT, which maybe was a mistake, because they made it with 'thick cut bacon' which really means Canadian bacon, which is a thick fatty ham, which wasn't really my thing. I suppose it's my fault for not saying anything or asking about it beforehand. The buffalo chicken dip was great, and the onion rings are really good as well, very crispy.

i don't make as many trips with friends into ithaca as i used to, but back when i did this was usually the place we got food at. good selection beer and it's also known for a very good burger menu. the fries and onion rings are very good as well and this was my first introduction to smoked gouda mac n cheese, which i now incorporate into my own homemade mac n cheese. and if you're not in the mood for burgers they have other options. the only reason i'm not giving this a 5 is because i feel like once or twice my burger was not cooked how i ordered it, i think they put the wrong patty on the wrong bun because there was a group of us ordering 4 or 5 burgers so i guess it could have been easy to mix one up. price wise the burgers are reasonable, not cheap but not really overpriced, but i do feel like i looked at other menu items that i wanted to try and the price kept me from trying them. definitely worth checking out.

Great local bar.  Selections from the best breweries: Stone, Sierra Nevada, and even some local brews :)   They just got in the Sly Fox Odyssey which is one of the best IPA's I've ever had. The hamburgers are to die for.  The surf and turf burger is a salty, epic extravaganza of homemade crab cake and fresh ground beef.  Their buns are from Ithaca Bakery and are phenomenal.   It's not cheap, but I do feel like I got what I paid for.

I LOVE THE ALE HOUSE. I'm an NYC foodie at heart, so finding a fantastic restaurant in upstate NY has proven a challenge for me. Ale House is one of the restaurants I will truly miss when I graduate college and move back to the tri-state area. I always order the Bastard Burger--a pepper-encrusted burger with spicy mustard and a giant onion ring on top! Perfect amount of seasoning. I recently tried their Six-Onion Soup (the sixth onion is an onion ring on top!). My only complaint is that it took the soup twenty minutes before it was able to be consumed; it was scalding hot at first. This restaurant is great for dinners with your best friends or large groups...just be sure to arrive a bit early--the popularity of the restaurant usually causes lines out the door. You must, must, must stop by here. I've eaten outside on a beautiful day and I never felt more relaxed. Ale House and casual dining go hand-in-hand.

A friend and I hit this up for a Saturday lunch. I was turned off by the comments on here about their crap service, so I was glad we sat at the bar -- our bartender was on her game. The atmosphere isn't terrible and they have a nice bunch of HDTVs for bar sitting. The beer list had a great variety-- the usual suspects (Dogfish, Southern Tier) but also some others I haven't tried, like Founders. I also appreciated the pairing suggestion on the menu. But the real home run is the "Perfect Burger," which I had with onions rings. I thought I found Ithaca's burger at NorthStar (which still kills this place in terms of atmosphere), but this one has it beat. The meat was perfectly cooked -- pink and juicy in the middle -- and served with BLT, cheese, onions, and mayo. I think $11 is a lot of money for a burger, but for this quality I am counting the days until I head back.

The buffalo chicken spring rolls are a must have, we also got wings and we all got different burgers everything was cooked properly to If u don't loce their food then somethin is wrong with you period.

Back in town for Reunion weekend, and since my favorite Ithaca bar has sadly closed (sigh - a moment of silence for The Palms), we ended up here instead.  Decent selection of beers on tap with plenty of local & regional choices, and a lively, good-looking crowd of students and locals.  The bartenders were attentive, and the atmosphere overall was good.  They've got a bunch of flat screens up on the walls, so it's kind of got one foot in sports-bar territory.  Worth a stop if you're in the area, but not unique or characterful.

So I am on a personal hunt for the best burger. I've had a lot of burgers and this ranks up there! But alas, my hunt continues as it was not the best I have ever had. So let's start with the bun. I got the honey roll as I like a lighter, sweeter bun. It was warm and definitely fluffy, not too much bread for the burger. The burger was cooked perfectly the two times I went which lately at other places has been an issue with consistency. Anyways the burgers have good flavor, you can tell it's not just beef their serving you but beef with seasoning cause let me tell you, a burger with no seasoning is just grandmas meatloaf again. I had the Kobe burger once and I wasn't impressed by the quality, honestly I preferred their regular burger. The toppings, they give you a good amount, 2 slices of tomatoes, fair amount of lettuce and good size onion pieces, not just the inner small pieces like some places. You can tell that they care about consistency and their burgers. The fries are pretty good as well which every burger connoisseur knows, is a big deal. You need good fries for a good burger. Their chipotle aioli for the burger is pretty fantastic as well and doesn't just taste like mayo, but has great flavor. The service here is always pretty fantastic, energetic staff with a smile who generally seem to care that you are there. Overall this might be my favorite go-to burger place in Ithaca, but like I said, not the best!

Great beer. Decent food. Adequate service. Noisy atmosphere. If we lived here we'd come occasionally. If we visit again, we'll check out someplace else.

The buffalo chicken spring rolls are to die for!   The bar also has a good selection of local and micro brews, and there is often a seasonal flight available for those who can't make up their mind. The service is always friendly, but be ready to wait up to an hour for a table if you come on a Friday or Saturday night (especially if it's a parents weekend for one of the local colleges).

The food here is pretty hit or miss. I've been disappointed the last two times (ordered the veggie flatbread, BYOB burger). But I've also had some other pretty decent sandwiches in the past. The beer selection is definitely the best on the commons, so that's a plus. It's a pretty chill place to hang out if you don't have super high expectations, and if you're willing to shell out $12 or more for mediocre food. Also, wait staff doesn't impress me much... not sure if the bar tenders are any better.

Wait staff is very friendly, and my beer tasted good, but I ordered my burger medium and it came out well done. Come on, this place prides itself on burgers. There's no excuse for that. Their onion soup is decent, their french fries are better than their onion rings. All things considered, I wouldn't recommend this place, but considering it's tough to find good food in Ithaca, I can't say for certain that I won't be back.

They have excellent burgers here. The bartenders are awesome, and the outside seating is great when its warm outside. If you don't want a burger their flat breads taste great and their salads are decent (but nothing special). They also have a weekly karaoke night where the singers are really good ... kind of makes it intimidating if you just want to let loose and sing something god awful...but also makes it more entertaining if your just watching.

I liked this place, though it was hot inside. Air conditioning please. The bartender was nice and let me try a couple of samples before I settled on my choice. I'll try the food another time.

Good burgers and beer with a bit of a local dive feel.  Service was attentive and prompt. There were a lot of kids from the local college and university, so it appears to cater to a younger crowd.

What's not to love? The Faux Nachos. Reaching into a plate of shared nachos, pulling out a large clump of nachos stuck together by toppings and using your other hand to separate them and put back part of the clumped together nachos.  The pretentious Bottle Beer Menu, "Chimay Blue" come on, it is 2012 we are not living in the era of "Stilyagi". Now for the bad news, I tried to use the concept of feng shui, I relocated the Faux Nachos to the east, to banish the unwanted flies at our table, however it was useless. How can anyone screw up grill cheese, ask my fifteen year old daughter; IAH really where was the Rosemary Focaccia Bread?  (Recipe: 2 slices of Wonder Bread White and 2 slice of Land O Lake white American grilled with a little butter,). The Knife and Fork Steak Sandwich  steak and bread tough. Ithaca Ale where is Clemenza Caserta Jr, when you need him. I wanted to like this place, the service was good, hip ambiance, maybe next time lunch and have a burger at the bar.

Very nice beer selection. We enjoyed the outside seating. Decided to try the Alehouse Burger. Ordered it cooked medium but it came out well done and we never did have our waitress stop by to ask how we liked our meals so I ate it as it was. Great toppings (good bleu cheese, caramelized onions & bacon) and the beef seemed fresh but, cooked as it was, I am not sure I would stop back.

IAH has a good draft selection and a lot of unique local beers. Food-wise, the place is best know for their burgers, so I decided on the "Fat Kid", a delectable delight of a burger with two grilled cheese sandwiches as buns!... Sounds better (to me at least) than it was. Not a bad burger by any means though. The grilled cheese was less than steller... the burger had so much potential. The service wasn't great either, though it was busy. Every time I needed the waiter, I had to flag him down, and he didn't seem too enthused to be working. Overall, a good burger and beer spot.

The service wasn't great either, though it was busy. Every time I needed the waiter, I had to flag him down, and he didn't seem too enthused to be working. Overall, a good burger and beer spot.
Benchwarmer's was always my favorite place in Ithaca when I went to college there. Now that it's closed down, the Ale House has assumed that mantle. Their burgers are very good, the beer selection is huge, and the atmosphere is solid. It's not as cheap as other place in the Commons, but it's also not a "grab and go" kind of place, and I'd argue that you get what you pay for.

My family and I have enjoyed this place. Good ol' burgers and a large beer selection. I love sitting at the bar - which is huge. We'll be back!

Any menu with deep fried oreos and buffalo chicken eggrolls is a gem. Great place for anyone looking to satisfy a hearty food craving and wash it down with a craft beer.

Been here about a half-dozen times and it never disappoints. Bar and wait staff are great and they have fantastic burgers. Mostly American pub fare and done well. Try the " Garbage" wings - sounds awful but they're fantastic.

I've always been pretty happy with Ithaca Ale House. The food is usually pleasing, they have a wide selection of beer and a very diverse menu overall. it can be fairly loud inside, and sometimes the service is so-so, but I wouldn't have gone back time and time again if I hadn't enjoyed myself!

I can't believe I haven't written a review of the Ale House until today. I have been going here for the better part of 3 years and I have a great experience every single time I go there. The food, beer, and service are all top notch and conducive to return visits. I take people here when they come to visit. It is a place that I will miss when I finally leave Ithaca! As the name implies, a major attraction is the beer. The taps rotate and they pick up some seasonal releases from some of the better breweries such as Great Lakes, Ithaca, and Dogfish Head. They offer flights of beers and serve them in the appropriate glassware. The thing they do, which I wish other places did, is they list their drink prices. Nothing is more infuriating than paying $6 for a Guinness when you don't expect to. Kudos on the price listing! I do wish they had more unusual or highly rated beers like anything from Russian River, Cigar City, Lost Abbey or Founders. Despite the lack of extreme beer, they have enough of a selection of really good beer that never disappoints. I actually come here for the food instead of the beer. I feel it is reasonably priced and excellently prepared. Most of the dishes are assembled in house from scratch. Some of my favorite dishes I have had there are the chicken and biscuits with gravy and the BBQ plate that had the best fried chicken I have ever had (seriously, it sounded like a car accident when I bit into it. The chicken was that crunchy!). I usually end up getting the flat bread pizzas most of the time. The crust is crispy and chewy and perfectly cooked. I get the 3 meats, summer veggie, and the Thai chicken pizza that is on special sometimes. I do really enjoy margarita pizza because it is true to what it should be; torn basil, sliced tomatoes and fresh mozzarella. It is just perfect in every way. The burgers are also some of the best in the area. They are huge and all of the sandwiches have the right amounts of condiments to make them memorable. I wish they would buy out one of the places adjacent to it so they could expand. It gets a bit crowded during regular dinner hours. Once you get to your seat though, the tables are all quite spacious and comfortable. The service is usually very good and I have never had a jerk server or someone who tries to up-sell or get you to drink fast. They are quick with filling your glass when you ask for another round. I really like sitting outside on the sidewalk in the summer time with a good beer. They have plenty of TVs so you can watch some sports if anything of importance is going on in the world of sports. The Ithaca Ale house is one of those places that just speaks my language when I go out for a casual night of eating and drinking. I simply love this place and cannot wait to go back again soon!

Whenever I return to Ithaca, I hit the ale house.  Why was this place not around when I was at IC?  I think I have been here about 4-5 times and I have ALWAYS had a great experience. Great nachos, burgers, pizza you get the picture! Once of the best beer selections in the city, certainly the best with a full menu.  If you like quality food and beer you will NOT be disappointed!

Nothing to find much faults with. A good place to enjoy local beer and burgers with your bros.

Burgers are decent. I had the Kobe Brie Burger, but I'd choose something else next time. Service was just OK. Waitress never came by to check on us or make sure food came out OK. Fairly small spot compared to most ale houses I've been to. Plenty of TVs to watch games.

This is a great place to sit on the patio and people watch. Good food, good beer, goo people watching... what else can you ask for? Seasoned fries with curry sauce were amazing and Tuscan chicken grinder!! Yumm. Pyramid apricot on draft! You can tell that this place takes care of their lines because the beer was so fresh and crisp.

Amazing atmosphere, was there to watch March Madness and it was as good a time as I could possibly ask for. We arrived around 8 o'clock and were told it would be about a 45 minute wait, which we expected because of the games being on and the live music they had for the night. We went in and were pleasantly surprised by two bar seats opening up immediately so we grabbed them and decided to sit at the bar and watch the games and have dinner. The bartenders were quick, like really quick, on drink orders and refills, they have a fantastic selection of beers on tap and mixed drinks, made right, none of this half a shot of rum and a glass of coke business. Having looked over the menu and asked for recommendations, the bartender, actually a different one, because the other was busy, said the Buffalo Chicken Spring Rolls were their most popular so we got them and HOLY *&^% they are amazing, I mean like crazy stupid amazing. I wasn't crazy about the Sun-dried tomato bleu cheese, however it did not need it. Hands down one of the best apps I have ever had. For a main I had the Surf & Turf burger, which after the spring rolls was a lot of burger to get through. However, it was fantastic down to the last bite. The burger was cooked perfectly and the crab cake was seasoned just right. We were never hassled at the bar even though we ended up sitting there for a few hours to watch Syracuse, and the bartenders each earned a big tip! Great restaurant/bar, great atmosphere, definitely a must if you are in the Ithaca area looking for dinner!

First time in Ithaca. Went here from a suggestion from the car rental guy. Crab cake appetizers were awesome and my daughter loved her burger. At the recommendation of the server I ordered the French dip and was completely disappointed. The restaurant was full and had great atmosphere and a great beer selection but seems hit or miss with the food. $36 for a crab cake appetizer, a burger, a French dip and a soft drink. I'm thinking I won't be back.

Had a decent enough burger that went well with the Ithaca Apricot Wheat. A little faux rock and roll, but what are you gonna do.

Well, the appetizers were great.  The nachos piled high with "stuff" (the best part) and the buffalo chicken spring rolls were delicious. HOWEVER, I ordered a burger (who doesn't when you eat here?) and I definitely pulled more than one hair out of it.  GROSS!  A major turn off.  I am hesitant to go back for that reason.

The Ithaca ale house is truly one of if not the best restaurant in Ithaca New York. I've never had anything bad there. The food is not only spectacular but the beer selection is phenomenal. The burgers are definitely their flagship but everything on the menu is fantastic. location is right in the heart of restaurant Row and during the summer the outdoor seating and atmosphere is Perfect. The only downfall that is barely a downfall is that because it's one of the busiest restaurants in town sometimes it's hard to get seating and it's crowded. A True five out of five

Overpriced HORRIBLE service. OK food.

Basic bar food. The burger was done perfectly and tasted like one you'd make at home. Sierra Nevada kellerweis was $4 which seemed reasonable. The service was a bit slow, but it could have been because we were sitting outside.

Decent food, but I always leave feeling like it is overpriced for what it is. This is upstate NY, and a burger should not cost $11-15. If you do find yourself here though (as I do once every few months, since this seems to be a popular place for groups), the Big Sexy burger is plenty tasty, as are most of the sandwiches. The flatbreads are disappointing, so I make a point to steer clear of that section of the menu, even though they sound good on paper.

Lots of beers on tap, good service, and good food keeps me coming back to the Ithaca Ale House. I particularly like the "French Kiss" which is Brooklyn Chocolate Stout mixed with Framboise Lambic.  Also, they have sliders as an appetizer, and if you are not too hungry they make a nice meal to share.

This place is so tasty! Their menu is awesome. They have a lot of variety, but not so much that the menu doesn't seem connected to itself. They are known for the burgers but the salad and pizzas are just plain awesome!

Good food and friendly, helpful service. Our family of 5 enjoyed nachos, wing dings, chicken Caesar salad, white garlic chicken flatbread pizza, and more. Somehow we found room to share several desserts, and they were all great (and large). Definitely worth another visit.

Good beer. Good food. Good value. Fun, lively college town atmosphere. Meets the road warrior's seal of approval.

Solid selection of rotating beers, and great burgers and salads. The place looks like a regular ol' joint inside but I think they manage to take normal fare and put interesting twists on it to make it worth the price. It is a little expensive but nothing unmanageable. I like to go on Thursdays for a nice dinner before going out to bars.

Consistently good coma-inducing burgers.  I recommend the perfect burger, despite appearing like a very traditional burger it is somehow much better; though the other burgers are good too.   The place gets crowded around dinner, and doesn't take reservations, so have a backup plan ready if you bring a crowd.

Great!  We all loved it. Perfect burger, Sexy Burger and Fat Boy Burger and crab cakes not a bad one in the bunch.

I would describe this place as better than your average bar food.  They had a special called fall fries that can with an apple cilantro mayo and it was phenomenal.  They offer a variety of burger options that all sound inventive and delicious.

Was seated at table and then we waited over 25 minutes for service.  Wait staff walk by repeatedly never even offered water or asked if we needed service. Our table of 5 left. Very disappointed as we heard some good things about place. Was very crowded but still no excuse

I don't want to like this place, but I do. They have a decent beer selection, though a little on the blah side and I have certainly had better service. If you are a serious beer drinker and looking to try something new, you might be a little disappointed. But the selection is seasonal and they have a lot of local stuff, which I like. Though a beer lover, it is not the reason I go here. This is the place for "cheeseburger time", specifically, the mini cheeseburgers. They're listed in the starters, and I usually split them with someone and order another appetizer, like the wings. Their wings are crispy and lean, and they have a lot of good sauces to choose from. I am picky about my hot wings, and they never let me down. The french dip is also really good, and comes with it's own bathtub size bowl of au jus--they also have homemade chips if you don't want to fill up on fries. Great food, but Beware the Frat Boys.

I'm really just giving it three stars because the chocolate chip cookies are to die for.  Eat dinner someplace else, and come here for cookies and milk.

We decided to eat lunch here Friday afternoon at this college campus style bar/restaurant before going on a hike. We ate early so it  was not crowded. They have a fairly decent beer selection  (a lot of locally sourced beers, that's always a plus for me).  I had the 'California Chicken Wrap (grilled chicken, sun-dried tomatoes, grilled vegetables, spinach, Goat cheese, and avocado cream). The sandwich was good but I did not like the 'avocado cream', I think I would of liked  fresh sliced; avocado pieces instead.   Kate had the  'Tuscan Chicken Grinder' (sliced Tuscan marinated chicken, Provolone cheese, roasted red peppers, banana peppers, pesto and arugula). That sandwich was excellent! We both chose the fresh fruit salad special as our side dish.  For beer, we had the 'Ithaca Apricot Wheat'  (local)   and  the  'Wachusett Blueberry Ale' (Massachusetts). Kate liked the beer but I prefer Blue Points blueberry beer......  Our  server was nice/attentive. Our water was constantly  refreshed. We would stop back again if we were in town. Giving it 3.5 stars.
Ate here tonight for the second time. We were visiting my son who is a student at Ithaca. There were six of us. When we arrived at 6:15 we were told to expect a 45-60 minute wait. We were also told to expect it to be closer to 45 min. We were sat.....an hour and a half after we arrived. 45 minutes past the originally quoted time While not what I was looking for, my expectation was that the restaurant would make some kind of adjustments. We started with the nachos, very good. Each of us had a burger and they were all enjoyed. They seemed to be cooked as ordered. The waitress did a good job. When we were sat, she apologized, as she knew we were waiting an exceptionally long time. She actually commented, " you will enjoy desert"  being with 4 college students I thought that would be a nice gesture to acknowledge the terrible job in seating us. I couldn't have been more wrong. As I left I noticed a manager expediting the food items. I went up, asked if he was a manager and told him I wanted to share my experience. Upon telling him what happened I was surprised by 2 interesting facts. 1) he had absolutely NO idea what had happened. How is this possible? 2) he didn't offer as much as an apology. NOTHING He simply said, "okay" I know that quoting a wait is often difficult. But the way this went down was really unacceptable. The manager should have come to us during our extended wait. The food is good and the service was good. The wait and the manager....not a clue! It's important that this part is handled the correct way. Tonight it clearly was handled terribly. I only hope they get it figured out, only time will tell. It could be a real good burger and beer place.....
Had the prime rib sandwich, which was good  (but it was shaved steak, not prime rib).  The food was good, and a step above regular pub fare.
Gourmet bar food.  Ale House hasn't really decided what cultural inspiration they want to have in their food, so it's American with things like "Jerk Burger" or "Spring Rolls" appetizers.  I'm not complaining, it's just a big variety of choices.  The food is good, no doubt about that. The atmosphere is in a strange grey area that cannot decide if it's a fun pub style restaurant, or a hopping bar scene at night.  I've experienced a little of both and both are a little strange. One thing that is NOT unclear is the Prices!  In fact, that's what knocked of at least 1, if not 2 stars for me.  If I felt as though I was getting a true Ithaca experience, eating the best of the best burgers, local or organic food, etc. I wouldn't mind paying $11+ for a burger and fries.  But come ON.  You and a partner can't even have lunch for twenty bucks.  I don't know very many students willing to drop that on food that is not the be-all-end-all of cuisine. The alcohol prices are also quite high.  This is not unusual for Ithaca, but Ale House lacks any kind of specials or happy hour (That I know of, correct me if I'm wrong).  Every time I went it was $6+ for any beer on tap that was not mediocre.  Just saying, I don't go out and order Bud Light.  So expect your alcohol tab to be high if you're going here for that purpose.  But props on the selection, it is indeed one of the best around. The service, like many have said, is often mediocre.  My food experiences have been so-so with service.  The usual scenario is a friendly waiter then a long wait for food.  I've had better service, I've had worse.  As for the night drinking scene, there's always waiters/waitresses scrambling to clean up the final dredges of dinner plates and diners while many come in for drinks.  They always seem intensely irritated by the customers.  I was once here with a very large group (which I know for certain was bringing in a LOT of revenue for the restaurant that evening) and we were met with angry glances, instructions where to move, sit or stand, and overall really poor treatment.  The bartenders, however are usually pleasant and put together.

As you would expect in a college town like Ithaca, the Ale House offers quality beer on tap, well above average bar food, and a friendly, diverse clientele.  During each of the three visits here when in town, I have found the wings to be very good, with a variety of flavors and sauces. House salads have been good, but not outstanding. I had clam chowder once - good flavor, but very salty and extremely short on clams. Burgers are excellent. Bottom line: a definite cut above most with very good food and beverage, friendly and interesting people, and good place to relax, watch people and sports on TV.

The alcohol prices are also quite high.  This is not unusual for Ithaca, but Ale House lacks any kind of specials or happy hour (That I know of, correct me if I'm wrong).  Every time I went it was $6+ for any beer on tap that was not mediocre.  Just saying, I don't go out and order Bud Light.  So expect your alcohol tab to be high if you're going here for that purpose.  But props on the selection, it is indeed one of the best around. The service, like many have said, is often mediocre.  My food experiences have been so-so with service.  The usual scenario is a friendly waiter then a long wait for food.  I've had better service, I've had worse.  As for the night drinking scene, there's always waiters/waitresses scrambling to clean up the final dredges of dinner plates and diners while many come in for drinks.  They always seem intensely irritated by the customers.  I was once here with a very large group (which I know for certain was bringing in a LOT of revenue for the restaurant that evening) and we were met with angry glances, instructions where to move, sit or stand, and overall really poor treatment.  The bartenders, however are usually pleasant and put together.
As you would expect in a college town like Ithaca, the Ale House offers quality beer on tap, well above average bar food, and a friendly, diverse clientele.  During each of the three visits here when in town, I have found the wings to be very good, with a variety of flavors and sauces. House salads have been good, but not outstanding. I had clam chowder once - good flavor, but very salty and extremely short on clams. Burgers are excellent. Bottom line: a definite cut above most with very good food and beverage, friendly and interesting people, and good place to relax, watch people and sports on TV.
We were touring colleges.  We asked folks where to go and they suggested the Ale House.  It was a sunny day in September.  We were seated outside. Great drinks.  The bean soup was great.  We got mini burgers off the appetizer list.  Added fries.  They were wonderful with the rolls fresh.  Bacon, onions and a properly cooked burger! Attentive staff!  We parked in the parking garage.  Loved Ithaca.

My husband and I came here with a local Ithacan who knew we were avid beer drinks.  It was lively for a Sunday afternoon, but were seated right away.   They have a nice beer list with a number of unusual and hard-to-find options including Dogfish Head 120 min on draft - wow that's a killer beer. We ordered a round as well as some burgers.  The build-your-own burger option is a great way to go.  I don't eat cheese and just want the basic toppings (lettuce, onion, tomato and pickle) so the burger with a side is only $9 - that's a bargain for the size of it! The burger was cooked perfectly and the onion rings were awesome, seriously amazing.   I did manage to finish everything (barely) but I was then too full to enjoy another beer.  ::sigh:: Overall, great ale house with a smart beer list and solid food options.  I would come here again in a heartbeat.

The bathrooms here are in serious need of a good cleaning, paint and updating. Yesterday the men's rest room was beyond gross.

Best burgers in town hands down. Great beer suggestions to go with them as well. Gets real busy on weekends for dinner so go early.

First off. The beers. Great selection. Second. The food. My burger was cooked to a perfect medium rare and was delicious. Third. A couple next to me got a fish sandwich. Normally, I'd expect a nubbin of a fillet but this thing was the size of my forearm. TL;DR: good beer, good food

Had the Kobe Burger. Not many times when all of the elements of a burger are all there...this was one of those times. Burger (medium well) was perfectly cooked. Honey bun was toasted not burnt. Cheese and toppings were quality and not taken for granted. Nice atmosphere and a decent amount of beers on tap.

If you're in the market for burgers and beer, the Ale House is the place in Ithaca. They have the best burgers in town, and the service is always friendly. But because they're so good, there's frequently a wait.

Ate here a month ago on a Thursday night. Was really in the mood for a good burger. I ordered the Kobe burger with lettuce, tomatoes and onion. The first few bites were good, then it was all downhill from there. It was dark, but I did a second take on the half of the burger that I hadn't touched, and sure enough, there was a bug crawling in the green leaf lettuce. I immediately brought it to the servers attention, and she took the burger off the tab. I tried to look for an email address or some way to contact the restaurant electronically, but to no avail.....so I have decided to write the review. I sure hope it was a learning experience for the staff as it was obvious the lettuce has not been properly washed. Certainly unsafe food!

When I heard the name, I thought of the Ale House chain of restaurants we have in Florida. This is not a chain.  Glad I gave it a try. The "perfect burger" was great!  Opted for onion rings on the side and they were very good also.  Wrapped it all up with the cookie sundae....all I can say is 'wow'.  All of the food we saw coming out of the kitchen looked great. Wish we had one of these nearby.

When you pay more than $10 for a burger, it better be freakin gigantic when they bring it out to you. And this place does just that. Their burgers have some pretty creative names to go along with their creative components. I got the Ale House Burger, which is one of their more simpler options. Check out their menu on their site to see a list of what they have and what they put into them. My only problem with the burger I chose was that the bread they used for it was pretty thin and absorbed a lot of the juices from the meat, so it fell apart rather easily. Other than that, it was very great and very filling. The burgers come with a side, and you can choose the typical fries or onion rings, or go healthy with some salad. If you don't feel like getting burgers, they also have lots of salads, soups, and flatbreads. I sat at the bar and service was pretty good. The bartender was very friendly, especially to his frequent customers. The rest of the wait staff seemed to be very efficient and friendly throughout the restaurant too.

Very simple menu with good beer selection. Good to try once but don't expect anything great.

I lived in Ithaca for 2 years and the ale house became my go-to place for casual dinner. I never found anything on the menu I didn't like (and I'm pretty critical). The burgers are by far the best in ithaca, and ALWAYS came out cooked perfectly. The salads are great too, especially the steak salad. Blackened haddock po'boy is also nice. Never had a pizza but I hear they're good too. They obviously have a large beer selection. Service is also flawless. Unlike some of the other better places in ithaca, the ale house is extremely consistent, and cheap for the quality.

Was in town over the weekend and got just what I wanted, very solid food and a great draft list.  The buffalo chicken spring rolls live up to the hype.  Hot molten crack might be a better way to describe these delightful treats.  I really enjoyed the steak salad as well.  Everything was fresh and tasty.  I didn't eat one, but the burgers looked great and I heard no complaints from the folks sitting at the table with me who did.   This spot is definitely worth a visit for those that enjoy a solid meal with their beer.

Cool little place with an outdoor area. It is very modern inside which was surprising seeing how this is such a hippie loving area. The beer was decent. I've had better, however, I've had worse ;)

Caveat: I probably wouldn't know a super-premium burger if it hit me in the head. I can't detect various kinds of ground beef (although I know a kobe burger from something cheaper) and I don't know a lot about seasoning and forming patties. That being said, I was very pleased with the burger I had at Ithaca Ale House. It was nice and thick, juicy, tasty, and done exactly to the level I ordered. The jalapenos they use on the Jerk are fresh and spicy! Not for the feint. The toppings were all nice and fresh, and the fries were crispy and delicious. There are doubtless better burgers out there to be had, but maybe not in Ithaca. The selection of beers on tap is very nice as well--lots of local stuff including some things from Ithaca Brewing Company that are hard to come by, like the Excelsior series. As of 12/21/2013, they have Bell's Christmas Ale on tap, which is one of the top 10 Christmas beers in the country.

I consider myself to be a spoiled restaurant patron, so believe me when I tell you you won't be disappointed at Ithaca Ale House! Service was excellent, staff was super friendly and helpful, great menu, food came out fast Buffalo Spring Rolls- Amazing! Exactly as you would expect; hot, cheesy goodness. Alehouse burger- delicious; love the rosemary focaccia bread. Kobe Burger w/Brie & Jalepenos- delicious; Jalepenos were fresh & grilled, beef was cooked perfectly, flavor from the Kobe beef was fresh with a hint of charbroiled goodness. Grilled Cheese- delicious; cheesy, toasty, what more can you ask for!

We had dinner there (2 adults, 3 kids) and Loved the food! The veggie burger is great as well as the blackened haddock sandwich. There is outdoor seating. Highly recommend.

Appauling customer service, what a shame because the food was actually good on our first visit. The service and managment here is seriously lacking. I have never witnessed such rude customer service and lack of organization. Some things I noticed while waiting over an hour only to leave without actually eating~ No one was greeted at the door and most had to wait for the hostess. (The girl standing by the door in uniforn said nothing when we asked her for a table for 2 please nor did she speak to anyone else that came thorough the door. One man had to ask twice to eat outside as he was alone and he was asked twice if he wanted to sit at the bar.  As if it was a problem that one person should take a whole table meant for 2. My dinner was wrong twice,  and a cold shoulder when we asked to speak to the manager. He came over and said "what do you want me to do,what do you want me to do, we gave you the wrong food, what do you want me to do, we didnt charge you for it." Well I certainly hope not!  The waitresses serving the table behind us comped them 2 appetizers because they came out with the food not before. So why the manger was such a jerk to us I have no idea. He acted like he didnt believe that I I didnt get what I order which was a chicken sandwich with no bacon. First I got a lettuce and tomato sandwich. Then I was brought a chicken sandwich with bacon. I dont eat pork and I didnt think asking them to hold the bacon was a major request. The waitress offered to get me another sandwich but it would NOT be on the house. By this time my husband had been done eating for 20 min, what was the point. Then we had to ask the hostess to please take our bill because we never saw our waitress again. Terrible experiance. We will not return.

I'm in Ithaca for work and this place was recommend. Great meal. Lunch was good and filling staff was fun yet professional. I would go back and then go back again.

Some of the most creative bar food I've ever had.  I brought my daughter here on a visit to Cornell.  The balsamic reduction around the edge of the Caesar salad added interesting flavor to a decent salad.  The Guacamole BLT had the thickest cut bacon I've ever had, and was decadent.   Service was prompt and the kitchen got our orders out quickly.  Portions are huge. 5 stars relative to pub food.

Wanted to bring some friends here next Friday night, so I called ahead to ask about the beer flights. The girl on the phone wouldn't answer any questions about how many flights are offered or what the price is. She only told me, "You'll have to come in to get those answers." Well, guess what?! We're not going to.

I've visited Ithaca Ale House twice after writing my initial review, and have been impressed with the quality of the hamburgers - juicy, handformed and flavorful. I think that the "Fat Boy" must be an exception to the menu (or perhaps when I visited the first time, I happened to eat a poorly-made one" Ithaca Ale House also continues to have one of the best selections of beers in Ithaca. Great place to visit with friends for a nice, casual meal.

Really good food and service. The seared tuna salad was AMAZING such a nice combination of flavors. The calamari was good too the only not so great thing was the French onion soup which had really rubbery cheese and was scalding hot and soggy. Fun place to visit in Ithaca!

I love this place. I have been here at least a dozen times, and have ordered different things from the menu each time. The burgers are great. High quality ground beef. Fresh rolls and vegetables. Service staff is attentive. Large portions and the prices are very reasonable. My go to place for a good burger and beer in Ithaca. This and Wegmans are probably the only two things that I will miss about Ithaca.

Fish & chips is one big piece of fish, but plain.  Tuscan chicken was tasty.  Friend liked his Black & Blu sandwich.  Very good beer list - some favorite micros and interesting local selections.  Get the Caesar salad instead of fries.  Service was good.  They will let you taste a beer if you want before you order it. Place is fairly small, so it's tough for them to fit larger groups together.  We were barely able to squeeze the 12 of us at one table.

We had a group of nine and it isn't very big place, but they were able to split us up into two tables pretty quickly. The wait was only about 20 minutes. We had a good time. The beer selection was good. I wish we could have sat as a group, but I understood. Food was great! I got the "Perfect Burger". It was very good and the fries were great too. My friends got the pizza and it was enough to share and very good. My other friend got the "dark chocolate, chipotle pork" that was on special that night and said it was really good too. The service wasn't amazing, but it was good. Our waiter certainly had a lot on his plate but he was still good. All in all if you are looking for a bar and grill to go to in the Commons, I would recommend Ithaca Ale House.

I stopped by here for a quick drink. Had one of their mixed cocktails and it was good, but overpriced. Really wanted to try their Bailey's cheesecake but the kitchen was closed.

I underestimated this place for food. Amazing beer list and great place to watch a game but I figured it was just bar food. Sure they have bar fare, like the nachos, which were really good. But the ahi tuna served over salad was fantastic and perfectly cooked. The burger was sublime. I can't wait to go back for the flatbread pizza. The food at other "fine dining" places in Ithaca isn't as good as the food here. I am impressed!

Nasty. The food was gross. The waitress was an idiot. Clearly didn't want to be there. Not sure why she was. Service sucks. And not cheap either.

Great place. We went on a nice day and sat outside and took in the street scene. Great selection of beer, I really liked the local apricot wheat. Nice and crisp and you could actually taste the apricot. I had the black and blu sandwich which was amazing. Really tender and melt in your mouth good. The bread was perfectly toasted. The only complaint I have is that the fries were average and a place like this I would expect them to be great. Regardless, I will go back next time I'm in the mood for some good food and a causal atmosphere.

Big hearty burgers with lots of fresh toppings filled our bellies on a cold drizzly day. I ordered the Bastard, burger with a crisp onion ring and Bastard Ale Mustard because I like them bad boys. Yes, yes, I do. The burger was huge! The meat was so juicy that my brioche bun eventually disintegrated. I love having a crispy onion in my burger because it gave some texture and contrast to the burger. The lettuce and tomatoes were very fresh. I couldn't taste the mustard because it got drowned out my everything else in the burger (and by the gallon of ketchup that I poured on my burger -- that's how I like my burgers, with lots and lots of ketchup). I love the fries. So crispy because they lightly batter the fries in starch first. My friend ordered the Guinness soaked burger and she loved it. Said that she could definitely taste the Guinness.

Another option on restaurant/bar row in Ithaca. We stopped for lunch on the 4th of July. I got the "Zaaa" flatbread pizza, which was decent. Wifey's order of Fish and Chips was a "I dare you to eat the entire thing" plate of not one, but two fishes, battered and fried. She felt bad being responsible for killing two fish when only one would have done the trick. But hey, with it being the 4th of july and everything, why not do it up the American way? Their beer selection was impressive and once again, we lamented the fact that Binghamton lacks serious brewpub style eateries.

I like going here for lunch since it's a quick shuttle ride from Cornell. The food is consistently good and the menu does get refreshed from time to time. The single item that sticks out for me is the homemade potato chips. Always warm and malt vinegar is available to make them shine. I've had their burgers, flatbread pizza, caesar salads, and a bunch of specials. The regular fare is good, but I prefer to grab the special most of the time. From my experience the special ends up being the best out of the entire menu. The waitstaff are consistently friendly and are very attentive. I have never needed to get their attention for a refill or to get a plate removed. It can get noisy at times during the lunch rush, but even when all the seats are taken there's room to move. All in all a good place to eat.

I've had their burgers, flatbread pizza, caesar salads, and a bunch of specials. The regular fare is good, but I prefer to grab the special most of the time. From my experience the special ends up being the best out of the entire menu. The waitstaff are consistently friendly and are very attentive. I have never needed to get their attention for a refill or to get a plate removed. It can get noisy at times during the lunch rush, but even when all the seats are taken there's room to move. All in all a good place to eat.
It's the Chapter House, if the Chapter House cleaned the place more than once a year and served food.  Actually, I guess it's nothing like the Chapter House, except for the wide selection of beers.  Dozens of beers are on tap for a price that is at least comparable to that dank grad bar up the hill.  The crowd is decent here too with a good mix of townies, grads, and well behaved undergrads. The food is decent, if not unspectacular.  It's bar food, prepared as well as bar food can.

Amazing burgers and good beers. Occasionally they even have some from Oregon on tap :) Try the crab cake burger for the most delicious coronary trauma you can buy on the commons. It can be hard to get a good seat sometimes but if you are looking for a burger and beer you can't go wrong.

Great place! Tell Mosher and Woody I say 'Hi!' Everything is good here. Always has great seasonal beer, awesome food. Very lively place. Burgers are to die for!

Very good...worth the wait we experienced when we first sat down. Turkey Reuben was very tasty and not dry. Burger done perfectly. Onion rings were crispy and just a bit greasy (in a good way) to let you know they were fresh fried. One thing that kept this from 5 stars was that they only have two single-service bathrooms one male,one female and only one at a time....seems unusual and inconvenient for an Ale House.

Had a random craving for a French dip sandwich today for no particular reason and found it here after reading a Yelp review. Hey, it's actually pretty good! Quite the surprised after being disappointed for the longest time with food in Ithaca. Tender meat and a soft bun with solid dip made for a great sandwich. Fries included were also just the right amount of crispiness to bring out their flavor. Also shared a $10 nacho platter appetizer which was way over sized and more then enough for 3 people. Add a few beers from their decent sized draft selection and you have a winner experience. Service was quite slow since we sat outside, more like neglected.

***Based on the vegan burgers*** I love that their burgers can be made vegan and theres so many options too. Plus the portions are great too and they all come with a side. The only problem I have is the burger itself. The buns are nicely toasted, the sauces that make each burger different was good, the salad and dressings are good(good as in it makes you want to eat salad) but the burger is a bit stiff and lacking in many areas of what I consider to be a good veggie burger.

Came here for dinner while in town for the Lindsey Buckingham concert 6/8/12.  We were seated promptly & our waitress was attentive.  We were able to sample a beer before we ordered which was appreciated.   I had the Founder's Dirty Bastard Porter - absolutely delicious.  Friend had the double IPA on draft - not my taste, but she loved it. Special was the NYS Orchard Burger - big, fat & juicy with 3 varieties of apples both chopped up & mixed into the beef AND thinly sliced on top.  Add sharp cheddar cheese & apricot/tomato salsa & you get a scrumptious burger.  I LOVED it.  And everything the servers carried past our table for other parties looked awesome - crab cakes, basket of fries, pizza with big juicy shrimp on it - YUM! I will come back here any time I am in Ithaca
After a decently challenging hike at Lucifer Falls, we were hot, tired, hungry, and thirsty.  Enter Ithaca Ale House... We ordered: Guacamole Brie Melt - pretty dang good Buffalo Chicken Spring Rolls - OMG delicious! The special burger of the day - The 5 Cheese Burger - nothing special and ALOT of cheese (obvi!) The "Jerk" Burger - pretty good Spicy Thai & Lemongrass Chicken - overly spicy, under tasty Philly Cheese Steak - good, solid Maryland Crab Cake Salad - good, HUGE, nice combo of flavors with avocado, crab, citrus-y dressing Ancho Chicken Salad - very similar to the crab cake salad - good, HUGE, nice flavor combo Onion rings were crispy and nicely fried, but not too greasy and the fries looked amazing!  We didn't get any, but I watched enviously as they traveled to other tables.  Overall, a solid meal.  I think going just for apps and drinks would be great - there is a hefty app menu and they were definitely the best part of the meal.

The Ithaca Ale House is one of the most consistently-good casual restaurants in Ithaca, whether you are with your parents when they come to visit (mine loved it!) or a group of friends. And considering that Ithaca is completely lacking in sports bars, it's also a place you could easily come catch a game on one of the TVs hanging over the bar. True to its name, it offers a wide selection of local and imported ales, and even make suggestions on the menu for which kinds of beer will go best with each dish. Ale House covers all the bases when it comes to American grub, including an impressive variety of juicy burgers that satisfy the cravings of even my it's-not-good-unless-I-grill-it-myself husband. There is a decent amount of (undoubtedly delicious) fried food on the menu, but if you cherish your arteries, there are plenty of other less-heart-attack-inducing selections as well. Opt for one of the fully-loaded salads (the Maryland Crab Cake Salad and the Ancho Chicken Salad are my top picks) or my personal favorite, the flatbread pizzas. Ithaca is seriously lacking when it comes to pizza that isn't totally smothered in cheese and grease--ditch that soggy cardboard for one of Ale House's 'zas instead. I highly recommend the Grilled Veggie and the BBQ Chicken, but be prepared to fight off your tablemates who will definitely try to steal a piece.

We were visiting Ithaca for the first time and we stopped in to have a drink and sat inside. The bartender was nice and let us taste a few beers on tap. My BF really like the apricot wheat and another ale. We took a look at the menu to see what they have, we were not exactly hungry for dinner yet and we were just site seeing at this point in the day. We returned to have dinner bc we couldnt get the burgers that we saw on the menu out of our heads. We asked to be seated outside, the night was so nice. We were seated but it look a bit for our waiter to get to us he apologized and took great care of us for the night. We both order burgers- i had a " make your our burger" and i asked for my burger to be cooked medium with bacon and mushrooms- my BF ordered the "jerk burger" with jerk seasoning and jalaponos and bbq sauce with cheddar cheese. Our burgers came and they were DELISH- made just how we asked. We loved the atomsphere of sitting outside and ppl watching and seeing old cars pass by. we will 100 percent stop at the Ale house again!

This is a great place to eat.  It's a small, but well-used space.  Modern, and industrial, yet cozy and inviting.  They also keep it very clean which is a big plus.  There is a really clever tap system the for their multitude of beers.  They have 4 half-kegs sticking out of the wall with like 5 taps each.  It's an attrractive, and eye-catching set-up.  Almost makes me want to get into craft beer...almost. The name ale house suggest another run of the mill pub-style place.  It is however, anything but run of the mill.  They take the food just as seriously as they take the beer, and it shows.  Everything I've ever eaten here has been very high quality, and well executed including the most perfectly seared piece of salmon I've ever enjoyed.  They also make great chicken wings, and flatbread pizzas.The service is fairly middle of the road.  I've never had amazing service here, but I've also never had awful service here either.  This is a place that consistently delivers the goods.

Went in here, hoping to have some decent pub food and we were impressed! This is more than just a pub- the food was great! I had "the Perfect Burger" and it was perfect! The kids ordered from a standard-looking kids' menu, but we requested that the grilled cheese be made with brie (a cheese my son loves and had appeared several times elsewhere in the menu) and they did it with no problems. My daughter's "kids nachos" order was huge and featured a dish or sour cream and a delicious fresh-made salsa. Because it was a pub, we went early (5pm). Wouldn't want to interfere with the vibe later in the evening. If only we had a sitter, we would totally come here for date night!

I went here with a group of friends last week and confirmed yet again that I just don't enjoy it.  There are very few options for vegetarians or those with food allergies.  As someone who is both vegetarian and burdened by a wheat allergy I got the only item on the menu I could eat - nachos.  And they didn't even come with beans.  The restaurant was  so loud that I wasn't able to hear over half the people I was seated with, and the place was only half full. Luckily, at the end of the meal I remembered that they also serve the worst coffee ever and I chose to skip it. The selection of beer is great, and I've heard great things about their burgers, but I can't offer much more than that in their favor.

The Ithaca Ale House is probably my favorite restaurant in Ithaca.  Their menu is basic American food (burgers, pizzas, salads), but they do an outstanding job with it.  I've had something from every section of the menu, and it's always been fantastic.  They have spectacular onion rings and the best grilled cheese I have ever had.  On top of that, the beer selection is terrific and the atmosphere is warm and friendly.   I feel like burger places get looked down on as unsophisticated, greasy food, but I don't think anyone would be disappointed with what they're served here.  Ithaca Ale House reminds us that stereotypical American dishes can be delicious when prepared correctly.

This is definitely some of the best bar food I've ever had. The chef really puts a lot of thought into each dish and the result is hearty, greasy, and delicious American food that has almost a gourmet twist. For example I got a Caesar salad served over a balsamic reduction and a guacamole Blt with uniquely thick bacon. The burgers looked giant and also very good - I saw one with a crab cake in it. The atmosphere is definitely loud and booming and in college town - it is a bar, but the food is really great.
Alright, I've been here about six times now, so I feel ready to review the Ithaca Ale House!  Where to start? I love this place for lunch. Good selection of beers on tap, friendly service, delicious appetizers (the onion soup is amazing and it's made out of six types of onions... I didn't really know there were six kinds), and just the most fulfilling entrées. Some of my favorites? The French Dip sandwich = awesome. The Big Sexy burger = also awesome. They also have a wonderful Philly Cheesesteak, with just the right ratio of cheese and meat, over a textured but not overly tough bread. Yum. I really don't really have anything bad to say about this place for lunch. Why not 5 stars? Well, I HATE going here for dinner. I'd give it a 2 for dinner, but because I liked it so much for lunch, I've giving it 4 stars. Let me explain... For dinner time, it's packed. I got there at around 6:30 pm one night, and the hostess gives me this withering look and says "We're booked for the rest of the night." Then she turns her heel and starts talking to someone else. Look, I know you just told me you're not seating me, but you could still treat me as a potential future customer and not give me that kind of attitude. What happened to the friendly service I've gotten there almost every Thursday at lunch for the last several weeks?! Moreover, I came to try to watch a Lakers game on the TV (the Benchwarmers in town closed down) and the hostess was like "sorry, everyone is watching the Big East." I know that's important to all of you, but can you just put the Lakers game on ONE TV?? I don't think that's so much to ask, especially because everyone can see the main TV on top of the bar. Just sayin'.

If you're into trying new things the Ithaca Ale House has 2 different flight samples. We ordered "What's New"!  4ozs. of 5 distinctly flavored draughts. Delish..... Well, an acquired taste for one of the samplers (for us amateurs)!!  The pizza is gourmet style, crispy flatbreads and a fresh variety of toppings to choose from. My daughter gobbled her personal pizza iin minutes while I enjoyed every mouth~watering slice of mine. I had the Veggie Pizza which include pesto sauce, asparagus, red bells, green bells and many daps of riccotta. I've include several photo shots as proof of delishesness....(not really a word in the real world) The service was just fine, not overwhelming, left us alone to savour the beer and pizza but was on top of filling our water glasses. So,  go there, experience, see for urself and yelp on.

Ithaca Ale House is exactly what you would expect from your typical college town pub - good beer, mediocre food and so-so service. My boyfriend and I had dinner here one night during our week long vacation in the Finger Lakes this past July.  We were really pleased with the solid selection of beers (both local and imported).  The food and service however, left something to be desired.  We ordered the guacamole brie melt app to share, which was unique and tasty.  If only the rest of our meal stood up to the app!  Our main courses (I had the fish & chips and he had a burger) were dull and listless.  Our server seemed distracted most of the time she was attending to us and made herself quite scarce for most of the evening. The crowd here is predictable - 90% under the age of 25, just looking to drink and not at all concerned about quality of food or service.  I'd probably come back here if I just wanted to hang at the bar and enjoy some good dark beers.  For dinner, there are plenty of other, more superior places to choose from right on the same block.

So happy Ithaca Ale House exists! This place has food and beer selections you can't anywhere else in the city. Their flatbread pizzas are delicious and very reasonably priced. I LOVE that I can get Framboise here! It makes the Popeye Pizza that much better. Service can be hit or miss, it generally depends on on how busy the restaurant is which on weeekends can be *very* busy. Lunch is usually the best time to go for superior service. Outdoor seating is great in warm months and the big booths in the middle are super spacious although not too comfortable. The bartenders here are usually very knowledgable about the wide range of beers available on draught. Food service seems to cut off around 9pm or 10pm which is too bad. I really wish they would offer some type of Late Night menu served until 1am even if options were limited. This would definitely make Ithaca Ale House more competitve with Bandwagon Brewpub for late night drinks, food and fun!

Yum! The burgers here are amazing. I like the 'Big Sexy Burger' which comes out with 'BS' written in barbecue sauce on top. The burgers are seasoned really well, tender, juicy, yummy. The toppings are amazing and fresh too. I also recommend the flatbread pizza. Our party shared it as an appetizer and we all agreed that it was fabulous. And of course, it's called Ithaca ALE house, so check out their beers... and ales, haha. Prices aren't too bad, though, you wouldn't be able to eat here every single day on a cheap college student's budget.

Friend and I made the trek up to Ithica to pick up some kegs of freshly brewed beverages from Ithaca Beer Co.  Stopped in here for lunch on a beautiful sunny day.  We sat out on the sidewalk.   At least a dozen good beers on Tap, hence the name Ale House...  I had a couple of Sierra Nevada brews that I hadn't tried before.  Helped my friend with his Racer 5 (he was driving). We shared the Buffalo Chicken Spring Rolls for App.  These were pretty awesome.  A pretty original dish.  For lunch I had a Jerk Burger and my friend had some sort of burger with a ton of toppings.  He went with Onion Rings, I went with Fries, which weren't the best.  Everything else was very tasty, but I'd probably skip the fries next time.  Will definitely go back on our next trip to Ithaca.

A lot of people love this place for their huge selections of solid American cuisine and their broad selection of delicious burgers. I'll break down this review in terms of four criterions. Starting with the most important part, the food. Food is probably definitely impressive especially in Ithaca where there are a gluttony of different types of American restaurants. I'd say skip the appetizers, even though I end up fried calamari every time I go there. As far as entrees go, order a burger. They're the most well-known part of Ale House's menu for a reason. I usually get a "Big Sexy" or when I'm REALLY hungry the "Fat Kid" burger. *Be warned, the Fat Kid is only for the extremely hungry. Just think 2 grilled sandwiches for the buns.* Restaurant atmosphere is also awesome. It's a pretty chill bar environment, but it's definitely a bit more high end. I love being able to watch some football while enjoying some burgers. Too bad I'm not 21 yet... wish I could have some beer with my bar food. Service has been solid every time even with groups of 6+ people. It amazes me when waiters are really able to give so much attention for large parties. I know we definitely make it pretty hard on them. I think the price is the worst part, but really, what is not overpriced in Ithaca. Compared to some crappier places like in collegetown or the commons, I'd definitely say Ale House is reasonable. Make sure you check this place out when you're craving some solid burgers. An alum told me that this is one of those restaurants that you'll always end up craving once you leave.

We all know that the bun makes the burger. Here, the bun indeed makes the burger but you can get the same elsewhere. All in all, the burger is good too. Great? Sure. Spectacular? Sorry, it fails to make a lasting impression. My friend raved about this place for the past 3-4 years I have known him. He went to Cornell and I finally managed to visit him as he was being wedded there. So I had to get a burger. The thing that I appreciate about this burger joint was that it does NOT overcook the patties. +1 in addition, the fries are very crispy +1 again. size? It's decent size. Don't worry, you will get full here. I think that's the general consensus amongst my friends who had dinner with me. If you are curious as to what I got, I got the Big Sexy. It was alright.
Food is good enough. However, the service is really terrible. When we entered the place, we were not asked where we'd like to be seated- outside or in the restaurant. Since we didn't mind that much, we were tucked in the back. It took maybe half-an-hour or more to get our food ready. It wasn't as if the place is busy either. We didn't get a heads up about the wait. We got different kinds of burger on our table. I found out I still like the classic burger the best. The burger with brie and apple is good though. Onion rings is really good. It is also nice that you are allowed to split the tab.
Friend and I made the trek up to Ithica to pick up some kegs of freshly brewed beverages from Ithaca Beer Co.  Stopped in here for lunch on a beautiful sunny day.  We sat out on the sidewalk.   At least a dozen good beers on Tap, hence the name Ale House...  I had a couple of Sierra Nevada brews that I hadn't tried before.  Helped my friend with his Racer 5 (he was driving). We shared the Buffalo Chicken Spring Rolls for App.  These were pretty awesome.  A pretty original dish.  For lunch I had a Jerk Burger and my friend had some sort of burger with a ton of toppings.  He went with Onion Rings, I went with Fries, which weren't the best.  Everything else was very tasty, but I'd probably skip the fries next time.  Will definitely go back on our next trip to Ithaca.
Solid burger, and a reasonable beer list. Not beer snob worthy, but definitely better than your average bar. Step one in expanding one's beer horizons. I was especially amused by the "beginner's" beer tasting sampler ("Did you know their were different styles of beer??"). I'd come back, but wouldn't go out of the way for it.
A lot of people love this place for their huge selections of solid American cuisine and their broad selection of delicious burgers. I'll break down this review in terms of four criterions. Starting with the most important part, the food. Food is probably definitely impressive especially in Ithaca where there are a gluttony of different types of American restaurants. I'd say skip the appetizers, even though I end up fried calamari every time I go there. As far as entrees go, order a burger. They're the most well-known part of Ale House's menu for a reason. I usually get a "Big Sexy" or when I'm REALLY hungry the "Fat Kid" burger. *Be warned, the Fat Kid is only for the extremely hungry. Just think 2 grilled sandwiches for the buns.* Restaurant atmosphere is also awesome. It's a pretty chill bar environment, but it's definitely a bit more high end. I love being able to watch some football while enjoying some burgers. Too bad I'm not 21 yet... wish I could have some beer with my bar food. Service has been solid every time even with groups of 6+ people. It amazes me when waiters are really able to give so much attention for large parties. I know we definitely make it pretty hard on them. I think the price is the worst part, but really, what is not overpriced in Ithaca. Compared to some crappier places like in collegetown or the commons, I'd definitely say Ale House is reasonable. Make sure you check this place out when you're craving some solid burgers. An alum told me that this is one of those restaurants that you'll always end up craving once you leave.
A great burger cooked perfectly med rare as requested.  A little dry but overall a really good burger.
