As a drunk friend at Cornell once said, "This is SO GOOD, and it's just bread, cheese and sauc.....zzzzzz." Nothing beats a late night PMP. Five stars.
Man alive, I get to be the first for Hot Truck!!!!! The best pizza sandwiches in the world.  Even better when fully inebriated and standing outside in a cold Ithaca winter on a Saturday night at 2am.  The best way for an over 30 MBA to feel like a 21 year old college kid. Make mine scooby AND shaggy, please.
Really good place with amazing cookers/cashiers pretty much every thursday it is my ritual to go and get my big willy or a north baker, and they never disappoint.  furthermore their location is really convenient and dont let me start on their schedule lol. I will miss this place once i graduate, but in the meantime i will binge on it.
HAWT Truck is a definite Institution for Cornell students. The Stouffer's French Bread Pizza was apparently copied from its Poor Man's Pizza (PMP). And they have Suicide Pizzas (since Cornell is infamous for suicides, although it actually doesn't have a higher rate than most colleges. We just tend to gather more press because of the gorges that students like to "experience". Personally, while a beautiful view going down, a painful and not guaranteed way to go) . Menu: yelp.com/biz_photos/KPSq… The "ambiance" of eating outside in the snow with sauce dripping on the ground is the key. No, angioplasty is NOT included with purchase but Gannett Health Services is just up the Hill. Get away, you Adkins freaks, vegetarians, and vegans! seriouseats.com/required…
when my child starts on solid foods, the first bite will be Hot Truck's Triple Sui.  It is that good
HOT TRUUUUUCK!! The sorority sisters and I were frequent visitors to this lovely establishment after many a night of haphazardly sliding through ice and snow after a night out... we usually could score standing waiting space in the front cab of the truck, and get just AWESOME 4AM pizza. Get me a Krazy Korean Hot and Heavy please... *drool* After graduating from Cornell, I used to make my own PMP's at home when the craving would hit, but they were never the same...
As a few other people have pointed out, the food is just average when you're sober. I can see how people would find it mindblowing when they're drunk, but I'm the kind of person who believes that you can't call it great food if you have to be inebriated before you can find it amazing. They have an interesting menu and you can see all the definitions for their stuff posted on their window. The guys who work here are pretty helpful with explaining the menu items if you need it. Eat it ASAP. I waited ten minutes after picking it up before I bit into it and the cheese was already cold and hardening.
Why would anyone give Truck anything less than 5 stars? It is absolute *perfection* in its field. For what it's supposed to be, there isn't anything better. I have fond memories of going on cold winter nights and stepping inside the truck for a few minutes to watch Bob in action, and he was always super nice.
Best late night food.
Good for quick, late night drunk meal. Kind of greasy, but delicious. It's the epitome of Saturday night post-party college food. Everything on their menu has the same 3-5 ingredients...
Get the PMP with GB-- or the meatball sub.  Hot Truck Bob is gone, but the meatballs are still made with care and attention-- like mom makes at home.   Just thinking about it makes me homesick for Ithaca....
I really love the French Bread!!!! It's so crunchy and tasty. I am very sad that they don't open for lunch =(((, otherwise I will definitely have their sub more often. I usually get sui with pepperoni. I've got the triple sui once, a french bread sub with pepperoni, meat balls, sausage and a lot of cheese, which was AWESOME. The PMP is good if you don't want any meat. Oh and the Moby Delight looks so good but I really don't want to finish one myself at the middle of the night. Again, I really hope they can open in the day from time to time. Update: Tastes awesome but it's just too many calories.....
MY LAST MEAL ON EARTH: Full Sui GnG BBQ - Toasted to Perfection Pizza Sub made with a half loaf of garlic bread, tomato sauce, homemade sausage, mushrooms, mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, crushed bbq chips (BBQ), lettuce and mayo (GnG = Grease and garden). This place is special. I'd consider naming my kid "the Hot Truck" it's so good. Seriously though, last meal on earth, at first I put down Risotto Ai Frutti De Mare or Hamachi Nigiri, but you know what....this, this would be it. A perfectly toasted Pizza Sub from the Hot Truck. Flaky easily crumbled exterior, warm gooey flavorful interior. SOOOOO INSANELY GGOOOODDD (sigh). Hot Truck 101: Since 1960, this truck has been serving some of the nation's best late night street food. The original owner Bob Petrillose created French bread pizzas, so successful was his original idea that Stouffer's kitchen eventually copied it. It arrives quietly around 11pm each night on Stewart Ave. just below Cornell's West Campus and it remains open till just before day break. All walks of life; hard core studiers, drunken frat boys, engineering professors, area residents, and sometimes even escaped architects  swing by here for late night satisfaction. During my three and half years at Cornell I spent many nights warming up in the truck, talking with Bob as the snow fell gently outside. Something was always  happening by the truck;  fights, screaming matches, impromptu acapella concerts, passed out party goers, streakers (literally butt ugly ones), rampant PDA...but no matter what was going on the food was always mind blowing. We ate here so often that once we even gave up Hot Truck for lent. :) This past October I went back (yelp.com/biz_photos/KPSq…) and was worried that it wouldn't be the same. It'd been over eight years since I'd returned and Bob had retired a few years ago. Well, the place still ROCKS!!!....the menu's the same , the trucks the same, and the pizza subs were even better than I remembered them. ***The only real suggestion I have is to eat it outside....you'll understand.**** The Hot Truck has its own language, I actual still have one of the original dictionaries...here's the basics: ---The Subs--- PMP = Poor Man's Pizza, basically bread sauce and cheese Sui = Suicide, half loaf of garlic bread, tomato sauce, homemade sausage, mushrooms, mozzarella cheese, pepperoni WGC =PMP but on garlic bread w/ less cheese RaRa, ReRe, RoRo = Different roast beef and cheese subs HaHa, HeHe, HoHo = Ham and swiss cheese subs (for both the Rs and Hs  a = pepperoni, e = sausage, o = mushrooms) There's also MOBEY, INDY, KRAZY KOREAN, SCOOBY, SHAGGY, SEP PEP, TUNA SURPRISE, KEN, W.T.F.(whatever they feel like making), GUINEA PIG, LITTLE SICILIAN, "North Baker", "The Firm", .....have fun discovering your favorite. ---A few terms to know--- "Run it through the garden" = add lettuce "Grease and garden" = lettuce and mayonnaise "Liquid Heat" = Cayenne pepper sauce "Hot" =crushed red pepper "Heavy" = garlic Plus "W", "Sunshine", "Death", "Cut", "Mush", "BBQ",.... When the world ends...find me here happily eating my Full Sui GnG BBQ Cut. Doesn't get any better than this, at least not in this life time.
WGC Pep! I remember the PMP's were only $1.95 in 1987...
As a drunk friend at Cornell once said, "This is SO GOOD, and it's just bread, cheese and sauc.....zzzzzz." Nothing beats a late night PMP. Five stars.
There is always a warm spot in my heart for standing outside in 15 degree temperature while the ground is being blanketed with snow. What makes this otherwise miserable situation enjoyable is the reward you get at the end... a delicious Hot Truck sandwich!!!! Ordering food from a truck is fun. These toasty pizza-subs are out of this world on any drunken nights! Once I get it in my hands, there is only one place that CSC could go... right into my belly. And my face can only read pure bliss. All of the subs are great and they all have their special place in the minds of Cornell Alums.... case and point... The Hot Truck moves to the Arts Quad for Reunion Weekend! With all of this writing and thinking about the Hot Truck... I want a PMP right now.

The food is not good But you have been drinking so Get extra kate sauce

A good late night food truck to satisfy your cravings.  Not for when you are sober, but a decent snack on your way home. Try the biggest sandwich with everything. You will eat all you can and make your roommates happy with the leftovers upon your return.
Why would anyone give Truck anything less than 5 stars? It is absolute *perfection* in its field. For what it's supposed to be, there isn't anything better. I have fond memories of going on cold winter nights and stepping inside the truck for a few minutes to watch Bob in action, and he was always super nice.
This came up on a random google search and I just had to write the review for the memories. Still the same place, same food, probably same guys. Half Triple Suicide.   Made my night after many late night lab sessions. Thanks for the memories, guys.

Hot Truck, what can I say...there's nothing else like it in the world. I've spent so many late nights there waiting in huge mobs over the past five years. I've seen about everything you can imagine go on at that place. The quality is uncompromising and the service is first rate. Get to know the employees  and they will take care of you. The hot truck vocabulary seems to have gone out of usage, which is a sad affair, kudos to the poster below who retained the original glossary, only the die hards stick by it these days. Use it to gain some street cred. Negative points to freshmen who come to the truck and ask if they have fries. This year they brought back the WTF, which is a good thing, it had been gone for a few years. The deli meat sandwiches are highly underrated, and the sandwiches combining deli meats with other meat products are great. Only order the Moby D if you are a real man. The portion of the population that can finish it in one sitting is probably outside of three standard deviations. My personal favorite is the Mena, the noblest of the sandwiches, an art piece reserved for the true connoisseur. I like to dress mine up with the topping set that I generally call "extra grossness" or sometimes "extra nastiness" depending on mood and intoxication. This generally consists of G&G, H&H, ONIONS, truck sauce, and pretty much everything else that can be added, all in large proportions. There are a few keys to eating a Hot Truck sandwich. First, take off the brown back as soon as you recieve the sandwich. This is not needed. Roll it up and throw it under the truck for good luck. Then work from the closed end of the white paper, open with teeth, and enjoy. The sandwich must be eaten before you get where you are going, it tastes better outside and the quality drops off exponentially with time. I've seen people eat part of the white paper before, sometimes intentionally, sometimes not, but either way its usually soaked in sauce and they all survived so this can't hurt. Unfortunately, hard times seem to have fallen upon the Hot Truck. Last year they cut back to only being open thurs-sun, and the lines that we used to see there (hourlong waits were commonplace) are no more. Now you can pretty much walk up at any time of any weekend night and have a sandwich in ten minutes. I feel a lot of this has to do with Cornell's recent overregulation of the fraternity system, which has lead to a significant drop in the number of open social events on West Campus. Stepping off the soapbox, just know that every time you visit the Hot Truck, you are doing your part to preserve a campus landmark. Now that's community service. As an addendum, I must say I disagree with some of the factoids about the truck up at the top (you know, the stuff in grey). Not good for kids? Come on!! No outdoor seating? I don't know of any place with more outdoor seating. No alcohol??!! You must be crazy, it's BYOB. I've personally brought the hot truck guy a case myself on more than one occasion.

The inventor of the French bread pizza! Its decent late night greasy food, but nothing particularly special if you eat it while sober.
WGC Pep! I remember the PMP's were only $1.95 in 1987...
I agree with Cat J.'s review that thier business hours are real limited, I just wanted to be a little more specific on thier hours as they are even more limited than Cat noted previously. Hot Truck is open Thursdays thru saturday from 9 pm until 4 am. Personally, I think they're losing business by not being opened around conventional dinner time hours (6-8 pm), not a place i'd bring  my kids to, as the place is mobbed with swearing college age kids at all hours after 9:30 most of whom have all had a little to way too much to drink.

Probably the best pizza that you will ever eat at 2am after a night of bar-hopping.  If you're extremely lucky, they will let you stand inside of the warm truck instead of wait outside in the cold.  And watch your step, there are some slippery stairs in the area.
The food is not good But you have been drinking so Get extra kate sauce
Oh the memories of late night triple sui hot and heavy.  I remember the anticipation waiting in a big group as the small little oven slowly produced these bits of joy.  Somehow the cold snowy night just seemed warm in the glow of the hot truck, knowing that you would be comforting your belly with that crispy goodness soon!

When it is 2am and you are drunk, YES...it is great. But at any other time of the day it is mediocre, at most!

I still have my Hot Truck Dictionary somewhere. Unbelievable food for anytime of the day but at 2 AM it was sublime. The Full Sui ruled.
I miss hot truck more than I miss most of my Cornell friends. French bread pizza doesn't sound like a unique concept and it doesn't seem hard to reproduce, but there's nothing like Hot Truck anywhere else in the country. I usually got the plain old PMP, just make sure to get the special sauce! I am not exaggerating when I say Hot Truck is my favorite "restaurant" of all time - and I consider myself to be a foodie!

As long as you can stomach the ungodly line (call ahead), you will be rewarded.  Play it safe and get a PMP (the classic) or aim for the bleachers and try the Little Sicilian: one third loaf of garlic bread with sauce, meatballs, cheese, sausage and BBQ potato chips.  But, if you are toasted and it is 10 degrees out and it is snowing, somehow you will find the strength to wait in line.
The inventor of the French bread pizza! Its decent late night greasy food, but nothing particularly special if you eat it while sober.
No idea what its rating would be if I had ever eaten it sober. But when you've had a few (or three times that much), a PMP is literally the best thing you will ever eat. Bread, cheese and sauce. What more could you possibly need? AMAZING.

Lunch is not that good but if your hungry late night and starving, then its pretty good. They do offer a lot of variety on their menu, but I'm not a college student so I'm not so into it!

Currently, its probably operating at 4 star level.  When Bob was there, it was easily 6 star level -- truly amazing (people would wait for hours outside in the cold!).  So I average that to 5 stars.
Oh the memories of late night triple sui hot and heavy.  I remember the anticipation waiting in a big group as the small little oven slowly produced these bits of joy.  Somehow the cold snowy night just seemed warm in the glow of the hot truck, knowing that you would be comforting your belly with that crispy goodness soon!
I started with the PMP as a freshman and graduated to the Triple Sui. Now as an alum, it's the Krazy Korean. Collin's right, this is best community service you can do. I was talking to an alum from 1977 and they too recalled the PMP... The toasted french bread crunchy on the outside with the tomato sauce-drenched gooey bread inside and oozing with mozarrella, it's as good as the first time. I look forward to visiting every time I'm there.
FORGET THE PMP, GO FOR THE TRIPLE SUI!  I had the half Triple Sui and loved it!  Nice and crispy on the outside and ooey gooey on the inside.  Meetballs were so tasty!  The guys in the truck were very friendly serving us.  Waited about 5 minutes for the two sandwiches we ordered.  Picked up a t-shirt at the deli in town--woohoo! We will be back! =)
When it is 2am and you are drunk, YES...it is great. But at any other time of the day it is mediocre, at most!
Hot Truck, you are my savior when I don't want to eat on-campus grub. All that grease and meat is worth the wait for the WGC or the KK (Krazy Korean representttt). Of course, one can never forget the much-adored PMP and those huge suis. Hallelujah. How I love you. If only you were open from Mondays to Wednesdays as well...
I still have my Hot Truck Dictionary somewhere. Unbelievable food for anytime of the day but at 2 AM it was sublime. The Full Sui ruled.
I'm sure it's wonderful if you're drunk, too young to cook for yourself (or live in the dorms and have no kitchen), or other factors that lead people to this.  Half the menu needs a decoder ring to translate.  I'm sorry I don't know off the top of my head what a PMP with double Jack Bauer sauce is, but you could possibly write descriptions down.  Anyways, I ordered 2 sandwiches from them, and neither myself or my fiance were impressed.  It seems to be a trend in college town that substandard food passes as the next best thing.  For the money, just not worth it.

Well--it is Reunion Weekend and I'm not on campus, so in honor of graduating from Cornell 20 years ago, Yelp decided to prompt me today to ask for my Hot Truck Review. And, oddly enough, just a few weeks ago when my old comedy improv group, Whistling Shrimp has it's last show of the year, I ate at Hot Truck. In fact, my friends and I were the Hot Truck's last customer for the night, an impressive accomplishment for a 41-year old and similarly aged alumni. But, I digress. My reflections on Hot Truck as an undergraduate at Cornell: 1. I'm drunk and hungry. 2. Hey, there's a truck with food. 3. Mmm...meatballs, pepperoni, roast beef and sausage all in one sandwich--sure I'll have a Moby D. or a Full Sui, or something else in mysterious hot truck code. 4. Eat fast. 5. Run for bathroom as soon as possible. So, now here's my view of Hot Truck as a middle-aged alumni: 1. I'm drunk and hungry. 2. Really? Yep, it's 2 AM and I'm at a party in Collegetown and I'm drunk and hungry, how odd? 3. Hey, is hot truck still there? Still Open? Really, it is? Wow--let's go to hot truck. 4. Why am I at a house party in collegetown and why are the cops here? 5. I sure hope that everybody here is 21. I think we should go to Hot Truck--NOW! 6. How the hell do I order? Was it the Full Sui or the Moby D that I always loved, or should I just be lame and get a PMP-Pep/Mush? 7. Damn, this seems a lot more expensive than when I went here. Wait, that was 20 years ago, damn. 8. I'm glad I got the Moby D. 9. It tastes really, really good. Hot and cheesy and meaty and saucy and yummy. Why is there a can of PBR rolling down the sidewalk? People still drink that? 10. Why did they just give us free cookies? They're closing? We never closed down Hot Truck when we went here? 11. My stomach doesn't hurt? Is that age, experience, or is the food less greasy? A mystery... I'm still not sure if the food is good, but the experience as a whole is excellent. Best, if you attend good comedy improv, drink a lot afterwards, and then go. And come back every 5 or 10 years--a key part of Cornelliana.
