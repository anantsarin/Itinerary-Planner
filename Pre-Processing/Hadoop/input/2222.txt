Pros: Delicious food. Haven't had a dish that disappointed Very affordable (most entrees under $10) Cons: A bit of a walk if you're a student and don't have a car Expect to wait ten minutes or more
WHAT?!? Most authentic & delicious Vietnamese food I've had in a restaurant. EAT HERE.
Walked in at 230 afternoon on a Tuesday. We sat down place smelled good. Looked at menu and we were brought water and that's it. Not one person said hi to us or asked if we ready to order. Several times the same waiter and waitresses walked past us and didn't say a word! A party of 4 people came about 15 mins after us and sat down and orders within 5-10 mins of sitting down.  So as soon as I saw that we walked right out! Horrible Customer service don't go!
good food. courteous owner. waitress just okay. long lines for a small place.
pros: best vietnamese food in Ithaca. As close as you can get to westminster Pho. BYOB!! con:  is a bit pricier than what I'm used to back in Cali.
Went here twice in 3 months, ordered the nearly the same thing. The food is a simply amazing. The pho is godly. Service is excellent & BYOB. Can't wait to do it again.
The pho is consistently good, so is the grilled pork chop and sunny side-up egg over rice. I normally order the pho, while my bf loves the pork chop. Altho, he was pretty sad that recently they only give him 1 piece of pork chop instead of 2 to make more profit. I've been eating pho for almost 20 years of my life (my family lives in Hochiminh city so ofc we've been having Viet food forever) and I'd say Saigon Kichen's pho is pretty decent. Wasn't particularly impressed with the rest of the menu to be honest. Service can be kinda slow, so don't come here being extremely hungry. But hey at least you can fill your stomach while paying less than 10 bucks. :-)
Pretty good pho, excellent coffee! Had a shrimp platter, okay-ish. Good place for a nice little reunion with old friends
Great food.  I eat here regularly and have tried most everything on the menu.  This is definitely one of the best restaurants in town.  They are always very busy but we have never had to wait more Han 10 minutes.

This is hands down the best restaurant in Ithaca. The food is unreal and very reasonably priced. I would highly recommend the spicy wings and pho.

This place is hands down one of the best restaurants in Ithaca.  The price here is reasonable and the food is very delicious.  My tip for getting a table at this place s to go around 5 pm, it's usually not as packed and you won't have to wait 10-20 minutes for a table!

This place was really great. Bunch of good flavors and dishes. Can never go wrong with any of the pho. the noodle dishes are exquisite. Groups more than 12 beware. This restaurant isn't quite cut out for large groups.

For starters the fresh roll or the fried chicken roll are delicious. For the main course, the pho is amazing. I love the food here. I keep going week after week!

This is the best pho place I have been to, in terms of the taste. I think they also give more noodles than other pho restaurants. The owner is very friendly! He speaks Korean greetings when I go there with my mom.

My wife and I love this place.  The pho and the Imperial Rolls are very good, as is the calamari.   The other stuff on the menu looks good, too, we just come with a craving for our favorites. There can be a wait for a table and the service can be somewhat slow, but that shouldn't keep you away.  This is by far the best Vietnamese food outside of Syracuse and definitely worth a shot.  I'm not sure what these 1 and 2 star ratings are about; we love Saigon Kitchen.

Excellent Service! Excellent Food! they even use washable chopsticks--most Asian restaurants with chopsticks have washable silverware, but "throw away" chopsticks, not Saigon! I came in for lunch on 3/8/12 @215pm and it was busy but not full. The server promptly greeted us, menued and watered us, then LEFT US ALONE because she saw we were engaged in a conversation and hadn't even looked at the menus for several minutes. I cannot tell you the number of times I have been to restaurants where the server demands you operate on THEIR time and order exactly when THEY want you to--harassing you by coming back even if you haven't initially opened...or closed the open menu, signifying you are NOT ready to order. No rude server interruptions at Saigon! They observed and noticed when WE were ready. The server was very kind in answering questions and letting me know the vegetarian/vegan options. The food was GREAT! I was not expecting it to be so tasty. The prices were reasonable, service was probably the best in Ithaca, great food, and they show concern for the environment (and the bottom line) with washable chopsticks. So great! --now I'll have to check if they compost....

Delicious! I've been here a few times.  The tofu summer roll was delicious, pretty standard.  I enjoyed the vegetarian menu, which makes eating out easier.  I liked the noodle dishes, but my favorite is the pho.  The broth is phenomenal and the never-ending hoisin sauce is fun to add more flavor.  I highly suggest this place. The beverages are fun. I enjoyed the bobba smoothies with all kinds of exotic flavors: jackfruit, red bean, coconut, avocado, mango... etc. They also let you get food to go which is super convenient!

SOUP!!!!  Saigon Kitchen is great. It is a must do in Ithaca, especially if you are a soup lover like me. The broth is just so complex and fantastic; you can't go wrong with the pho. I've had their crispy squid a few times and sometimes it is amazing, and other times it is just okay.  I really love the coconut water drink!

We're from out of town, and we're delighted that we found Saigon Kitchen. Our bun dishes were a real treat, and the service was friendly, although no one visited our table mid-meal to ask whether we were satisfied with the food or refill our water glasses. Overall, Saigon Kitchen is a new favorite in our second home, Ithaca.

What a great place! Great prices, great food....a must for anyone looking for awesome Vietnamese food.
The other reviews are spot on - the pho here is the best, the prices are great, and the service is terrific - even though they are almost always crazy busy!   We've also enjoyed their other offerings - especially the twice-cooked pork and their fried tofu stir fry.
Pretty good pho.  The soup tasted like it already had hoisin sauce in it so I didn't add additional hoisin to the broth, which I usually do.  However, the slices of beef did not come out rare and was already pretty tough by the time I got my pho, which leads me to believe that my pho was sitting in the kitchen for a while before they brought it out.

We chose this restaurant solely on Yelp reviews and were a little disappointed.  It was my first Pho experience and based on the reviews my husband and I were expecting some mind blowing food.   What we got was good service and decent food.  There was a bit of a wait, but that was to be expected because it was a Saturday at lunchtime.  You put your own name and the number of people in your party on the notebook on the counter inside.  This wasn't really clear, having never been there before, and we didn't realize it until we saw a group that came in after us write their name. We ordered the pot stickers for an appetizer, which were tasty and a decent size serving.  I had the Pho Ga and the first bite of chicken I ate had a piece of cartilage in it, which kind of turned me off and I didn't eat much of the chicken after that.  The broth and noodles were good though.  My husband had the Tai Bo Vien, which he loved, but ended up not agreeing with him about 30 minutes later. Overall, the services was good and the food was ok.  It hit the spot after a chilly morning of hiking.

Pho is top notch, crab rangoon is incredible, and service is great.  Also, BYOB which is always a plus.  Nothing bad to say about Saigon Kitchen. Go glad there is good pho in Ithaca!

We have been missing the vermicelli bowl since we left California, and are so happy to have a delicious version of it here in Ithaca. Food is delicious. Restaurant was very crowded so service was a little slow but the food was everything we wanted. Ingredients are obviously fresh and food is clearly made from scratch.

The reason this restaurant is always busy is it is EXCELLENT. The Yellow Curry is divine. The staff is efficient & there is never a long wait for food. Consistently wonderful. I would highly recommend whether visiting or local.

We got to this small restaurant after we saw it in yelp. The food was amazing! Really fresh, healthy, authentic and  really great prices- the best restaurant I visit in the last days. Value for money! Perfect for lunch and dinner. Wish I could eat there once again.

Outstanding pho - really exceptionally delicious broth, beef, and noodles. Friendly service and pleasant room. There was a line, but it moved fast. The spring rolls were very good also. Highly recommended.

Came here on a Saturday night with a friend. There was a line out the door! We didn't wait long though, since there were bigger parties ahead of us and a table of two was ready. The atmosphere was lively and it felt like I was in the city. I ordered the beef stew with rice noodles. It was amazing - the stew was sweet and the beef tender! The portion was quite large so I had to take it home and I cooked the stew the next day and added vegetables and put it over rice. I also had the vietnamese creamed coffee (hot) and it tasted like caramel. It was too sweet for me. My friend ordered the chicken pho and summer rolls and she ate every last bit! The meal came out to $30 bucks ($15 each), which is a pretty good deal! We're definitely going to be back!
Excellent! The pho was amazing (really flavorful!), the staff was friendly, and the price was good. It's a pretty small restaurant, so there was a bit of a wait, but I'll definitely be going back! Edit: Went back a second time. I got the pho again, and it was wonderful...again. But the people I was with got a simple vermicelli dish with grilled chicken. It was good, but not nearly as great as the pho.

Full Disclosure it was my first time eating Vietnamese food and I was very impressed by this place. It isn't very big so be prepared to wait on busy nights.  I can't begin to tell you how great the service was.  They staff was very friendly and was a big help explaining anything I didn't understand.  They also were constantly checking on our party of six to make sure we had everything we need.   The food We started off with a few appetizers the Vegetables & Tofu Vermicelli which was they made me try I really wasn't interested in trying tofu. It was amazing the flavor was so good, so good I could have ate the whole thing for a meal.  We also had the Pot Stickers which was had great flavor.   For dinner my wife had Spicy Jungle Fried Rice with Chicken which was good nothing out of the ordinary but very good.  I had the Pho Ga which was very good it was cooked well and had great flavor. Value we paid 36 bucks with tip for two meals and an appetizer which is a great value especially with the flavor.  I cant wait to come back to this place and try more things on the menu!

I visited Saigon Kitchen at lunch last week.  This was my first visit to a place that I've heard only good things about, and it didn't dissapoint. I had the lunch special of Lemon Basil Stir Fry with chicken.  The plate I was served was hot, HUGE, and only $6.95!  It was perfectly spiced...not so much heat that it over-powered the food, but enough to make my tastebuds say:  Wow!   I can't wait to have dinner here...I think it is probably a place that is best enjoyed when you have lotsof time. I hestitated to give it five stars because the service was a bit slow, but the quality of food and friendliness made up for that. Enjoy!
Had the pho and absolutely loved it!! Everything was fresh, great broth, and an EXCELLENT meat ratio. Lots of meat compared to other phos I've had. Maybe it's because we went towards the end of the day, but they ran out of vegetables! So it was good that my heart was set on pho because most of the menu wouldn't have worked out. Nice people, good service (it was completely packed at 9 pm when they closed at ten). Vietnamese coffee was a bit too sweet though.

We came here for a lunch date between classes after reading many positive reviews here on Yelp.  We showed up at 11:40 without reservations (we called in advance but noone picked up), and were one of the first parties to arrive for the day.  Not 15 minutes later, the place was fully packed with not a table free. We ordered a vietnamese creamed coffee (iced) and an order of crispy squid and a vietnamese salad as starters.  The coffee was excellent: strong, not too sweet, and smooth.  The squid was coated in a very light and not greasy batter, and wasn't overcooked (not overly chewy or tough).  It was served with a sweet chili sauce.  The salad was mostly comprised of napa cabbage, with a excellent light dressing and roasted peanut and cilantro topping.  Very light and flavorful. As an entree, we split a bowl of the House Special Pho.  It is worth noting just how massive the bowl was, easily enough to split amongst four people.  Some herbs, bean sprouts, and lime are served on the side to be added to taste.  The broth was rich and multidimensional, although the beef and meatballs were slightly bland (their flavors probably ended up in the broth). We wanted to try something new so we ordered the 'Rainbow Drink,' which was unusual and good.  Not something we'd order again but was interesting to try.  The texture of the beans and Tapioca is not for everyone. Overall, service was good (the owner came by to check in with us) and the food was flavorful and varied.  Additionally, prices were very reasonable.  We'll definitely be back to explore the rest of the menu!
Terrific service and great meal. I had the Volcano Stir Fry with chicken for lunch. Sweet and tangy. Choices of chili sauces on the table to spice it up more to your taste. My companion had the Lemongrass Stir Fry with tofu. Judged delicious too. Next time I'll try the eggplant, which looked fabulous at a nearby table.

I went here for lunch with two friends. Saigon is tucked away in a slightly divey-er part of town, without parking (expect to walk a block or two). The inside was clean, the ambiance casual, and the restaurant accommodated large and small groups. A Vietnamese friend of ours who ate here previously described it "not as good as home, but close". We all ordered variants of pho or pho ga, with a pot of green tea. The plate of bean sprouts and basil leaves were a nice touch, we could provide extra flavor as we wished. In my dish, the chicken breast was a little flavorless, but the broth was savory and the portions were substantial. The green tea was piping hot. Service was a bit inconsistent, though the place was only half-full, service was slow and they forgot a creamed coffee that was included in our initial order (the issue was quickly corrected). The price was a cut below the competition, and without a doubt this place is a good value if you'd like to enjoy some decent Vietnamese in the Ithaca area.
Place is delicious!!!! We will definitely be coming back. And our server was very friendly and prompt.

There are two Vietnamese places in Ithaca, and this one is by far the best of them. The pho broth is very good, and the vermicelli dishes are all solid. My only complaint is that pho is usually served with a heaping plate of vegetables (sprouts, herbs, jalapenos etc.) and here it comes with a very small serving. It really makes the pho less satisfying. But other than that, can't complain.
Food is good! Beef stew with rice noodle is my favorite. A little bit crowded, though

Most people from small town go visit big city will be wow by the wide selection of food choice. But we are from big city and visiting small town, and we were worry about the food quality because of the limited choice of Asian food. We find this place base on the review from Yelp, and we are very happy with the food quality here. Consider I had many pho places in the city, the pho here is top quality. The price may be higher than in the city, but the amount of meat they gave you justify the price. This IS the best Vietnamese food in Ithaca.
Steamed dumplings excellent.  Fresh spring rolls very good. Had pho special  with all the meats.  Very good.  Had order to go.  Would have preferred a tad larger portion of basil and sprouts but the portion  was adequate.    Definitely will  go back even  though  only  here on business  for 3 days.  At 2pm on a Sunday  every table was taken with a decent  line waiting  for tables.

I'm tempted to give just about every place with pho 5 stars, but Saigon Kitchen's was on another level. Slightly crowded for Sunday lunch but worth it. Friendly and attentive service. But the real star was the pho. Huge bowl for a good price, and OH the flavor! I was tempted not even to add sauces and spices, and frankly didn't load it down with Sriracha and chili garlic as much as usual. Light spicing just makes the natural flavored that much more noticeable. I don't know when we'll be back in Ithaca but this will be our first stop.
The food was delicious and the portions massive. The dining room is quite small, and the servers were clearly overworked, so there was a bit of a hectic feel to the place. Service was certainly slower and less attentive that I would like, but that didn't really detract from the experience. Loved the place, will definitely go back.

I'm tempted to give just about every place with pho 5 stars, but Saigon Kitchen's was on another level. Slightly crowded for Sunday lunch but worth it. Friendly and attentive service. But the real star was the pho. Huge bowl for a good price, and OH the flavor! I was tempted not even to add sauces and spices, and frankly didn't load it down with Sriracha and chili garlic as much as usual. Light spicing just makes the natural flavored that much more noticeable. I don't know when we'll be back in Ithaca but this will be our first stop.
We ordered the siracha chicken wings to share - big, plump and juicy wings covered in more like a sweet/sour/hot sauce ($6.95). For mains, I ordered the broken rice with grilled pork chop with an extra fried egg ($11.95) - pork was very tasty and not a bad effort to other Com tam dishes I've had before. It would've been nice to have a bowl of soup to accompany the dish. My other half ordered the fried rice with pork ($8.95) - massive serving... Interior is modern and clean and bright. Might check out the pho when I head back there next!
This is a really nice little restaurant not too far from the Ithaca Commons.  Since the college students are on summer break, we didn't experience the waits that other posters have commented on.  The portions were larger than expected, so my husband and I could have gotten away with ordering one appetizer and sharing an entrée. My rating is based on what I ordered, as I didn't like what my husband ordered, although he seemed happy with his food, and enjoyed mine too. We ordered two appetizers: crispy squid and the pork potstickers, and the honey lemongrass vermicelli.  Our bill, including two drinks, was around $30, which seemed really reasonable to us. The grilled chicken had tons of flavor and I liked that the vermicelli came with several types of raw veggies and a good dipping sauce.I don't eat squid but my husband enjoyed it.  I thought the potstickers were a little bland and greasy, but my husband thought they were fine (in all fairness, I am addicted to some potstickers from a place near our home in DC).  There were several other items on the menu that sounded really good that I'd like to try. The service was a little slow, particularly getting our check, but we were very happy to find this place and will definitely return if they are still here on our next trip to Ithaca.

Great food but horrible service. We waited quite some time before they took our order since we were soo excited to find Vietnamese food in Ithaca. By the time we got our food, we had 3 different waitresses. It's a shame the service was that bad, otherwise I would've given them 5 stars...
Great pho! And like most pho joints, your food comes out within minutes of ordering. The only thing keeping this place from earning its fifth star is the fact that my girlfriend's dish, some kind of Buddha Eggplant business, was unimpressive. Essentially a vegetable stir fry doused in some kind of sweet and sour teriyaki. My guess is if you stick to the standard vietnamese options (or, better yet, just the pho) you'll be in good shape.

I was visiting from Hawaii. So this place is good customer service for vegan. The portions are tiny though. Hawaii would have 4-6 piece spring roll instead of 2. Pho would have more vegs & noodles. Taste is ok. I like the Avo/coconut milk smoothie best.
Tasty, fabulous delicious pho and fresh roll appetizer!!! I just moved here from NYC area and have been craving Vietnamese,  I would have given 5 stars but I took my food "to-go" and would have liked it spicier. I cant wait for my next visit...probably next week.

Couldn't believe there is an authentic Vietnamese restaurant in Ithaca! The three of us ate around 80 dollars, cuz the food was just great(and we were hungry). Recommend: meat roll appetizer, hot and sour soup, fried chickem wings, honey lemongrass beef vermecelli.
As someone that once saw Anthony Bourdain go to Vietnam on television, I can say that I am a Vietnamese food expert. That being said, the food here is quite good. The prices are also very good. The pho is always hot, which is a good sign. The noodles, while clearly from a package, are not overcooked (i.e., starchy). The accoutrements (I threw in this word to give my review a sense of gravitas -- WHOOP! Did it again! Big words! I love lamp!) are fresh and tasty. I have not tried a dish here that was not tasty. If you've made it this far, you're thinking: with all your kind words, why is this place only a three star location? Let me tell you why. SERVICE. Let me tell you how reservations are handled at Saigon Kitchen. 1) You call in, naive and doe-eyed, hoping to claim a reservation for 6:30, a reasonable dinner time. 2) You leave at 6:00, get to the location at 6:15, and spend the next 13 minutes finding parking. You enter the restaurant at 6:31. 3) At 6:31, you go into the restaurant to claim your table. The kind old little Asian woman smiles, acknowledges you, and basically makes you feel like you're about to get in on the action. 4) At 6:31:08, you find out that your table is not ready, or was just given away to a one person party. You don't get mad because the little Asian lady is too nice and is always smiling. You smile back, but really it's a fake smile because now you're just hungry and irritated. 5) You wait for the next 20 minutes for the next table to open up. You play words with friends by yourself. 6) You realize that the reservation list is actually just a list of suckers who bothered calling in. Go to this place with an empty schedule and you'll be fine. Go on a time crunch and you might as well go on an empty schedule.

Phenomenal Pho (and other dishes)! However, the wait for a table and for food can be long... I would still recommend to go though. Totally worth the wait!
I'm not positive if it is the location, the staff, the kitchen or what but this place is absolutely the best food in town. Get there early. Long lines are bound to accumulate outside of the door by around 6:30, so like I said, make it early or wait up to an hour or so. I recommend anything on the menu followed by a boba.

After a five hour drive through New York State - this place really hit the spot. So glad they were open and serving food at 3pm. The house special pho was $10 and the summer rolls were pretty sizeable as well. The place looked tidy and clean, with wooden floors and a large lotus on the window, like it could have been a yoga studio in a prior life. I wish I had known to come here during college! The only downside was that I think they use MSG because a couple hours later, my husband and i were super thirsty.
This place is awesome!  Great food, stuff I could never make myself, and really well priced.  SO GOOD!   Get here early, it's always busy, which is a GOOD sign.  But they're usually pretty good at sitting people quickly.

Excellent food, especially the Pho.  The service is great, even when they are packed.  The prices are great considering how much food you get.
this is the best restaurant EVEr.  the servers are wonderful and mrs Lam the owner is the sweetest person ever.  get the calamari!  and then the pho!

We've been here twice. Both times the food was very good. They are usually busy but the servers are friendly and efficient. Now for the food. The chicken sate is tasty, but average. And the vegetable spring rolls were good. I personally liked their peanut sauce but my wife thought it wasn't as good as she's used to. On my most recent visit I had the house Pho, which was outstanding. The meats were cooked just right and the broth had a wonderful lemon taste --- delicious! My daughter ordered the chicken with vermicelli in a honey sauce, which was also delicious. My wife ordered the vermicelli  with meat rolls -- bad idea. The meat rolls were deep fried, almost like cut up egg rolls. However, her noodles were otherwise quite tasty. I've also eaten their tofu dish in the past which was excellent. So overall a very nice experience, but not without a few  hiccups.
The pho is good, especially for Ithaca, NY, and hits the spot when it's cold out. As long as you can tolerate that a bit on the pricier end for pho on the Westminster, CA scale (still dirt cheap in absolute terms), you'll be more than satisfied.

Saw 4.5 stars and over 150 reviews, so I was excited for pho after over 7 months! I read Alex's review after I had ordered, and really hoped that he happened to be there on an off day, but right now it's Friday evening, I'm on my way to NYC, and the restaurant is crowded with patrons, so it looked legit! However, my first sip of the broth was a simply hot water with a hint of beef, boo! Real pho broth should be simmered oxtail for hours upon hours so that all the flavors are captured in the nutrient rich broth. Very disappointed:( I'm taking the noodles and meat to my grandma's in NYC, gonna make my own broth from Trader Joe's instant miso soup mix, so I don't waste the food:P
Saigon Kitchen has a bit of everything to satisfy a craving for good Asian food. The prices are reasonable, food is good to very good but the service can be a bit awkward on occassions. I would actually rate it 3.5 but I have always had consistently good experiences here, though. I almost always get the house special pho every time I go here. The meats are always excellent, which is impressive considering I actually don't like the eye round beef slices that come with traditional pho because I usually find them tough and chewy. Fortunately, this isn't the case at Saigon. I just wish there was more tendon though because its so good. The noodles are always perfect as well. The only aspect of the pho that is inconsistent is the preparation and spicing of the broth. Some days, its bland with very little spices or complexity, other times, its thoroughly satisfying. I like my pho with lots of cinnamon, cardamom, and star anise and Siagon never has the high spice profile that I prefer. However, that doesn't make their version bad or unsatisfying, it just doesn't fit my exacting preferences. The imperial meat rolls and summer rolls are always very well made and tasty so I alternate ordering them every time. I have had the Vietnamese salad but I think its too heavy handed with the fish sauce and the shrimp are likely frozen with the dense texture of the shrimp. Overall, the food is satisfying and I usually clean my plate and overeat almost every time I am there. I have to say, the best part of Saigon's service is the woman who I assume is the matriarch of the establishment. She reminds me of my own grandmothers who always made me feel welcome at their houses, especially when it came time to eat. She seems to know everyone who comes in and makes a really great impression on everyone who walks in the door. She's adorable! However, the most inconsistent aspect of the service is that the servers don't speak loudly enough to hear them, so you may have some awkward moments. The other thing that irritates me about the service is that it usually takes a long time to get my check. Overall, though, I've never been dissatisfied with the service. The interior is ok and acceptable but the bathroom isn't very nice. Its not rundown, but I think the appearance could be improved. I usually go to Saigon on my West End Wednesdays for dinner then to Da Westy for some beers. If you make Saigon and Da Westy part of your Wednesday night, I'm sure you will enjoy yourself!

I liked this place and would come here again. Food - 3.5 Flouder is good, but too salty and i wish it included some vegetables. Sauteed vegetables dish was very good. Vegie rolls were ok and summer rolls were better. Food is pretty simple and the sauce really determines how good it will be. Atmosphere - 3 Pretty average with nothing special about the decor. Wall pictures are nice, but not very impressive. Service - 5. Generally, pretty good. Efficient. Price/Value - 4 Prices are very reasonable and the quality superb. Value is above average.
My new favorite restaurant!  Incredible eggplant, crispy tofu, curries - yaaah!  I am not big on pho, but loved theirs!  Great for lunch; quick, tasty and inexpensive!  The owners are so sweet and the service is excellent.  Never a bad moment in the ten or so times we have dined there!

Loved it! The Pho was outstanding, beef, brisket and meatball. Added an avocado shake to our meal and really enjoyed it.
Great food in there. Waited for 15 min on Friday night and got a table for two (3 ppl) to squeeze. Chicken wings tasted good but more crisper would be better. Delicious pho soup. One of the best vietnamese restaurant in the region (not a big one).

This is probably one of the most authentic Vietnamese places that I have been to. (I'm comparing this to the Houston Viet places, Houston has a large Viet population). Everything here is pretty delicious including the Pho, Vermicelli (Bun), and BBQ grilled meats, and even the stir fry and noodles. Right when you walk in you will immediately notice a picture of a smiling woman in a hat which will welcome you in every time you come in. I've had the Pho here and it definitely really is flavorful. They give you different options for what type of beef you want in your soup. The veggies that they give you with the Pho also look fresh not wilted like some of the other places I've been to. The bun is also very good. I would recommend getting this with the beef because the beef is very delicious. The shrimp and chicken are good to but I definitely think the beef has the most flavor. Vietnamese people are really good at marinating and grilling meat. Recommend any of the steaks and pork grilled meats. The stir fry surprisingly is good here too. During lunch time they have a lot of stirfry rice combo specials which you might want to try if you want to save some money. Usually I don't get the stir fry because I think everything else is too yummy. We will however order this with a large group of people family style. Highly recommend crispy tofu, and the flat rice noodle chow fun. As for appetizers get the chicken wings they are really crispy and cooked perfectly. Summer and spring rolls are good too. Overall I've had great experience coming here throughout college. The only bad thing is that sometimes this place is randomly closed. Maybe call ahead of time to check if they are closed?
We noticed the line going out the door last winter and figured there was something good going on here. We waited for summer to check it out when the students/lines were gone. We both followed the reviews and had the pho. I loved it and found it incredibly flavorful but it was my first experience with pho, so I have nothing to compare it to. The fried potstickers were better than average too. I know I will be longing to come here when it gets cold (it will be worth waiting in line!).

I know this review would be bias. It's only about the pho, but it was some impressive pho we are talking about here. Visiting friend in Ithaca and I told her I needed pho, so she shipped me to this delightful little place. My staying added up to be like 3 days, and we visited this place twice (would've been 3 but Monday the place was closed), I guess that says something. First visit: We had a huge lunch at another great restaurant in Ithaca and was so not ready for a bowl of soup, but since it was on my agenda we dragged our feet to the Saigon Kitchen. It was a little later than usual dinner time (as we intended to digest as much of lunch to maximize our experience with the pho) but the place was still decently full. Not too long of a waiting we were seated. Waitress of that day was kinda grumpy, very slow with stuff so wasn't much of a fan. I ordered the House Special pho with a limeade. The glorious little bowl of soup finally arrived at my table and man, did I not like it. Authentic pho broth with the perfectly prepared rice noodle, and all the classic parts of cow that's in the soup. I was hating my stomach while shuffle the whole thing down, I was happy. Limeade on the other hand, did not reach my expectation - WAYYYYYY too sweet. Second visit: I this time was hungry enough to consume a bowl of pho, and we landed by this place again. This time the waiter guy was super polite and did his work very professional, so kudos on that part. House Special and saw another dude drinking this orange thing, aka mango juice. House Special was as glorious as it could be, but the mango juice as just kinda water down and boring. Also, the owner was a little too cheap with the AC. Ithaca typically wouldn't be this hot but man was I not sweating while eating the pho this summer... I would've given 5 stars but there are bits and pieces of other components that needs polish. Still the most satisfying pho so far!
Wonderful!  I had the hot eggplant, my friend got the pho (with everything but tendon). The eye of round in the soup was a highlight, but the broth was also extremely excellent.  My dish, the eggplant, was absolutely delicious.  Not much more to say, service was fine, decor is inoffensive but not a plus.

Delicious food, good prices, big portions. Service is prompt and they move people through the restaurant effectively (it's not that big). It will definitely be busy so plan on waiting 20-30 minutes on weekends.

Awesome rangoons, Pho and Thai iced tea.  Service was on point, both friendly and prompt.
Stopped here last night for dinner and so glad we did. The food was delicious,the  servers were friendly and very attentive. They've done a great job modernizing the interior, its totally different inside compared to the restaurant that once occupied the same space. It's nice to have a Vietnamese restaurant within walking distance that also offers take out. I'll definitely be back.

One of the best meals we had in Ithaca.  We had to wait, but it was worth it.  The best lo mein of my life and some of the best tofu I have ever tasted.  I also am not a tofu fan, however I kept eating off my husband's plate.  You can really tell that everything is fresh there.  It wasn't the same run of the mill Asian food that you get at other restaurants. There is a reason they have the best overall rating and the most reviews of any place in town.  Thanks fellow yelpers!
Wonderful!!! Great food and friendly staff. Pho was very tasty and well made.

I've been looking for a decent Vietnamese restaurant in the area, and I finally found one! We ordered the Pho Chay and the Saigon Kitchen Curry Chicken, and they were both excellent. I've had better summer rolls (for cheaper) at other places. The service could improve a bit. They brought us the wrong type of summer rolls (ordered shrimp but got tofu), and we had to remind the server to bring us the check and also return the change (we were getting nervous when we paid $40 in cash for our meal that cost a little over 20 and didn't get any change back for a while). But everyone who works there are nice and smiling - I think it's a problem of being understaffed rather than not knowing how to give good customer service. Also, do NOT get your food delivered from here. They are consistently running late, pho was cold, noodles were all stuck together, forgot whip cream on my bubble tea... not worth it.

The beau absolutely loves this place and after hearing about so many group trips to visit, I knew I wanted to visit.  This is such a 'him' restaurant.  Is it good?  Definitely but the menu is authentic enough that its a little intimidating.  Nor am I anywhere near as adventurous as he is.  And he is useless when it comes to making recommendations.  But I digress.  The food is fresh and wholesome.  You can tell its made here, which is something you just come to expect in Ithaca.  The atmosphere has a clean dining room take on a restaurant setting.  The service is quick and efficient. Will I be back?  The food is good but I wasn't left raving.  I think I need to find whatever I feel is 'my dish' at a place like this but I've had so little Vietnamese food that I just don't know what to get to judge the place.  I suppose the only way to figure this out is to keep going so that being said, I'm sure I'll be back to keep exploring the menu!
Found a new place that suits both the vegan and gluten free diner! Excellent and fresh and flavorful with outstanding service. A very nice addition to the West End of Ithaca!

Who knew that Ithaca would have some pretty decent Vietnamese food. I was with a group of friends on a camping trip this past weekend when we were searching for some delicious, affordable, readily available hot food. Luckily, the city itself is quite small and I was able to do a quick yelp survey of most of the local restaurants. Overall: affordable, well liked, positively reviewed, accepts up to six credit cards, and is BYOB - no reason not to try this place.   The service: I had a party of 13, and we only had to wait 30 minutes, meanwhile everywhere else in town (that looked decent) had a two hour wait. The place doesn't take reservations so the fact that we got seated so quickly made me relieved and gave this place a plus one for service. Moreover the place is BYOB and given that we were camping, we had brought in a 24-pack of beer with us to the restaurant... And no we were not obnoxious :x. Overall the waiters were quick, reliable, and didn't get our orders confused, which is always a plus. And they served all of our dishes within five minutes of each other.   The space: clean, small-to-medium sized, well lit and packed with local hipsters, families, and Cornell students. When I ate here on a Saturday night, there was a consistent 30 minute wait outside with people standing in the cold and not complaining... something you'd never see in NYC. The decor overall was nothing too special ... filled with wooded tables and chairs with a lighter colored wooden floor it was just what I needed on a cold rainy day in Ithaca. The soup/food: Surprisingly better than expected with very reasonable prices and good portions. We had a party of thirteen and they managed to serve all of our dishes within five minutes of each other. Here's what we had... - APPETIZERS: Siracha Chicken Wings: six pieces, perfectly deep fried with a sweet and siracha based tangy sauce with ample meat and crispy skin. These were lip smacking delicious... the quintessential 'street style' appetizer that you have to get. Shrimp Dumplings: five piece order set... it reminded me a lot of dim sum in the city, except better. I'm not going to lie when I say this, but the actual dumpling itself is made to order, has a hefty amount of shrimp packed into its well constructed dumpling skin and is hot and good. Very impressed, and the presentation was pretty nice too. -MAIN DISHES: Beef Stew ($10.95): braised beef shank stew, lemongrass, carrots, and spices. It was a very hearty stew (not a pho) that had several thick pieces of beef with not that much fat but still so succulent. It wasn't spicy although it's deep brown and red coloring might make you think differently (see pic). The lemongrass was long and the carrots were nice and tender. Overall it was really good. I don't regret getting it but the soups/pho looked really good too. Sesame chicken ($10.95): standard sesame-American style casual dish. The pieces of chicken were hot, deep fried in a crispy batter and covered in a tangy and thick flavored sauce. It's not gourmet, but hell it hits the spot. Definitely hearty, and it was well complimented with a side of broccoli. My friend wanted to split it and I was hungry, so it tasted great! But again, very standard in its flavor and presentation, but why mess with something when it's not broken!? Overall FOUR STARS: Good service, good price, BYOB, easily sits larger parties, and the food tastes pretty damn good!
Delicious pho.  So so good. Large quantities, good prices for the amount of food.  Also, the house salad, is DELICIOUS, and cheap, and huge and healthy.  It's like $6.50 or something and is the perfect lunch or healthy dinner. My favorite restaurant in Ithaca.  We usually get take out from here during the week or on a cold evening, sometimes pho is just the answer.

Real talk: if someone told me I had to quit my job to continue eating SK's grilled shrimp bun, I would gladly move into my car and sleep in parking lots for eternity. Of course, this means I'd have to panhandle for bun money, but I ain't too proud to beg. If you complain about Saigon being busy, you're missing the point- good food is worth the wait. So pull up a piece of wall and wait for it. The fried squid is as close as I'll ever get to heaven. The vegetarian pho- Pho Chay, I believe- is lemongrassy and delicious.   I love you, Saigon Kitchen, and I don't care who knows it.
The Pho was great, easy to order over the phone and take out is very good and packaged nicely

Let me start off by saying, this is possibly the best Asian cuisine you will experience in Ithaca, NY.   The Pho House Special comes with rare eye round steak, brisket, tendon and meatball.  The broth is well seasoned and packed with flavor; it doesn't even require further seasoning.  The Grilled Honey Lemongrass Vermicelli with chicken is also delicious.     As for appetizers, the lemongrass marinated flank steak skewers taste like Korean BBQ short ribs.  If you've never had Korea BBQ, then just know these skewers taste bomb.  My only issue is that online it says the order comes with six, but you only get two.  The crispy squid is crunchy, but tends to be on the greasy side.  The sriracha hot wings taste like orange chicken, I personally wouldn't order this appetizer again.   I've also tried their Thai iced tea with boba, which is just okay.  It is sweet and creamy, but the boba has tasted old every time I have ordered it.  Now, I just order it without boba. Like many of the previous reviews mentioned, this place is extremely busy in the evening.  It probably dies down 30 minutes before closing.  I have never dined in because it can get a bit claustrophobic, as tables are very close to each and the space is fairly small, so I would suggest take-out. My only real complaint is I wish they were open later than 10:00 pm!
The food I tried last time was okay. The decoration was a little old, but worth visiting at lunch times.

One of the best Asian meals I have had in a long time. All the dishes were fresh and the flavors were unique and original. The servers were efficient . I was there at 7pm. They told us it would be 20-25 minutes so we went down the street and had a drink. Came back in 20 and the table was ready .  I have travelled through out Asia. Eat here!!!
A friend and I popped in before a movie to share some crispy tofu as a snack.  As we were eating, an older Asian woman (the owner?) came by to scold us for ordering one entree.  There were other tables open, but she told us that we couldn't take a table and just order a single entree.  Though I understood where she was coming from, she was quite rude and made us feel very uncomfortable.  She then came back a second time trying to get us to place an order for more food and telling us we didn't order enough.  We didn't have the time or inclination to eat more, so we hurried and left.  I won't be going back though I do recommend their crispy tofu.  Don't even think about sharing an order though, or you may be kicked out of the restaurant!

GREAT FOOD. Was on college trips and this was a great little spot to find for some amazing foreign food. Highly recommend.
What a delicious memorable restaurant! One of the best in Ithaca! Bright and Modern decor, a friendly attentive staff and wonderful food. It can't get any better. My fiance and I tried both the House special beef pho, Saigon street noodles and a couple appetizers, all of which were amazing. The house special beef Pho especially stood out as we continue to talk about it days later, the flavorful broth, light as air noodles, tender beef & meatballs left us wanting more. We will be going back often and would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to try something different and delectable in Ithaca!

2.5/5 The food here is pretty good. The pho and grilled pork on vermicelli is what I usually get. The pho is authentic but the beef is usually overcooked. Their grilled pork is quite tender though. The major issue I have with this place is how long it takes for the food to actually arrive at your table. It has taken over 45 minutes for food to arrive and that is just unacceptable no matter how good the food is. Also, there is only street parking for this restaurant so be prepared to have to go outside to put in more money. I would give the food 4/5 stars The service gets 1/5 stars
Happy to have a fresh new Vietnamese choice in town. Lunched on Pho Chay and Hot Eggplant in Garlic & Pepper Sauce. The Pho was fresh and flavorful, with vegetables that snapped. The rice noodles, though slippery, also yummy and lighter tasting than wheat noodles. The Eggplant was well seasoned with a tangy sauce, although it could have been a tad spicier (it is marked as spicy on the menu). As a lunch special it came with rice and a spring roll with a peppery filling. Probably the best thing I can say is that these vegetarian selections satisfied this omnivore for a healthy lunch and I look forward to a return visit to try some of their meatier options.

We were visiting Ithaca from New York City and needed a bite in the area. Our group found this on Yelp and decided to give it a try. There were 8 of us so the wait was about half an hour on a Friday night. The staff is pretty friendly except for one. They messed up an entree because my friend asked for no mushroom. The girl later comes back with a bit if an attitude and asked if he was allergic. My thought is, why does that matter? If someone don't want something in his food, he has the right. End of story. They include the tip on the tab so watch out for that. You don't want to double tip. Food wise.. It's okay. I'm Vietnamese and grew up with mostly Vietnamese food too so if it didn't blow me away, I say it's ok.
We've eaten here and also gotten take out several times.   The food is fresh, well-prepared, very flavorful, and good quality.  I love the fresh hebs (cilantro and basil) in the pho as well as the mung bean sprouts.   I brought my brother here (he lives somewhere else) and he loves pho hugely.  He was very impressed with the flavors. I don't love the restaurant space, but Saigon Kitchen has done well with the existing space and made it as nice and comfortable as possible.   A really great addition to Ithaca!

The rainbow ice (che ba mau)  is delicious! The pork chops were great too! The place is small and can get crowded.
I first went here when they'd been open for just two weeks. The place was quite empty at that time and I wondered if they'd make it!  Just a few weeks later and the place was insanely popular and has been since. Best time to go crowd free is....(Ha!! If I told you that,  I'd have to kill you!)   In terms of menu, I (vegetarian) keep coming back to the spring roll vermicelli with tofu, the Vietnamese salad, the vegetarian pho, the summer rolls as well as the vegetarian com dia with tofu (rice plate). My friend likes the flounder. We are recovering addicts. It would help with our SK recovery if we could just get a really good, well-priced Italian place in town! Bring your own wine/beer -- an added bonus! Very conveniently, there's a new wine store around the corner on Meadow with some good selections.

I'm so glad some real Viet food came to Ithaca. Definitely skip the Collegetown Viet restaurant and come to Saigon instead. The pho here is to die for. The service is great, the ladies here are great and I get the feeling of a family owned and operated restaurant. The atmosphere is also quaint and clean. Watch when you come though, peak times can be rough and lead to long waits. I tend to come here for early lunch at 11 or late lunch after 2. Otherwise, the place is packed.
This is an Ithaca favorite for Cornell students, faculty, and townies alike (also, BYOB!). The long waits from Thursday evening through the weekend are worth it for the delicious, piping hot Pho during Ithaca's cold nights. I haven't tried everything on there because I always go back to the Pho, something you can only get here in the town (other places don't count, sorry).  The serving is huge, and the beef broth is delicious, with generous amount of noodles, beef tendon and strips that are not overcooked. The table has fresh amounts of sauces, Siracha, and hot chilli oil. Fried Shrimp/calamari: Another favorite of anyone and mine I go with. It is distinct form the other appetizer options because these are big chunks of squid meat and delicious, light, crispy but fluffy batter, topped with chopped red and green chopped peppers and a great sweet sauce. Under $10. Beef Stew: For some reason I ordered this one night and it was good--the chunks of beef brisket are soft, tender, and not dry, and the broth is spiced well, though if you want it to be spicy, let them know. It comes with chunks of soft carrots. I added in mint as well. I will still stick to the Pho though, and they probably could have given more meat. Around $11 The service is very nice, happy and fast. They have bubble tea and also young coconut juice that comes with nicely sliced coconut. Don't forget: it's BYOB!! They also have stickers for regulars and check comes with mint chocolate pieces that are nice after all that broth.

Good variety of tasty food at reasonable prices.  Lemongrass stir fry and lemongrass skewer appetizer were excellent.  Imperial meat roll was interesting but a bit greasy.  Won ton soup was ok but not up to the other dishes.
Two things you should know before eating-in, or taking-out from Saigon Kitchen.   1. If you order take out,  head to the back of the dining room to pick up your order and pay.  No need to wait at the hostess station at the front of the restaurant. 2. If you are dining in, go right into the hostess station and sign your name and the number in your party on a document there.   The rest is easy and wonderful.  Take-out tonight included vegetarian spring rolls, fried vegetarian pot stickers, house special pho and grilled honey lemongrass vermicelli. Amazing food.  Wish I lived here!

If you are dining in, go right into the hostess station and sign your name and the number in your party on a document there.   The rest is easy and wonderful.  Take-out tonight included vegetarian spring rolls, fried vegetarian pot stickers, house special pho and grilled honey lemongrass vermicelli. Amazing food.  Wish I lived here!
4 to 4.5 starts.   Fresh ingredients.  Most dishes are excellent.  My brisket and rare beef pho was delicious.  If you like squid you must try the batter dipped squid appetizer.
This is probably one of the best Vietnamese food I have ever head! Wonderful service and amazing food !!
Good variety of tasty food at reasonable prices.  Lemongrass stir fry and lemongrass skewer appetizer were excellent.  Imperial meat roll was interesting but a bit greasy.  Won ton soup was ok but not up to the other dishes.
This is probably one of the best Vietnamese food I have ever head! Wonderful service and amazing food !!
Excellent food and ambiance!   We just ordered take-out and not only was the food delivered in a very timely manner - about 45 minutes -- but it was delicious and very flavorful!  Even their website is beautiful and clearly, someone took their time to create it in a thoughtful manner.   My new favorite restaurant - definitely the best Vietnamese food in town by far!
Saigon Kitchen is the best place to eat in Ithaca, IMO. I highly recommend ordering the Pho (beef especially), or vermicelli. They are always crazy busy. Expect at least a 15 minute wait -- during the winter this means crowding into the tiny "waiting area." They do allow for you to wait at Da Westy next door if you ask. Also, the service is pretty horrid at times. The last time I went I asked for a glass of water, waited 10 minutes, asked again for water, waited 7 minutes, and finally got my water. If you go here be sure to look around the restaurant. This place has an eclectic & diverse customer base. The last time I was there it seemed to be 1/2 asian students, 1/4 Ithaca townies / hippies, and 1/4 a mix of families & other students.

Delicious food and probably the friendliest staff I've ever encountered in a restaurant. Truly a hidden gem. I highly recommend the Saigon Flounder or Spicy Black Bean and Ginger Flounder; flounder in a Vietnamese restaurant might sound odd, but they are incredible dishes that I have tried and loved about five times. They do not serve alcohol, but you can bring your own and, if you ask nicely, they have openers. It is popular and crowded, but the place is large enough that you aren't banging chairs with other tables. Highly recommended.
Quite likely the best tasting Asian food in Ithaca. The Jungle fried rice and crispy tofu and the crab rangoon appetiser are some of my favourites. That being said almost anything on the menu probably won't disappoint. Weekend nights are extremely busy so you might have to wait a fair bit. But I'd say its worth waiting 20 minutes.
Maybe my husband and I ordered the wrong thing, but we both found the food to be bland and tasteless--though we ordered things on the "house specialties" part of the menu.

Always a long line, so come early. BYOB so that's a plus. Really great food, but after a few times starting to worry Saigon Kitchen only excels at their few specialties. Their pho is really just incredible. Also the lemon-grass vermicelli is just incredible. Calamari appetizer is very tender, so also very good. But nothing else has really earned my praise. Rice dishes are pretty mediocre as is rest of menu. But the Pho and Vermicelli are so stand-out this restaurant easily deserves 4 stars. Service is ok.

Let me say I love pho when it is done right. Restaurant owners seem to have more of a sense of pride in their product when there is a large Vietnamese population in an area and there is competition between restaurants.Then you get a higher quality of food. This element is lacking at the Saigon Kitchen. I have been to many Vietnamese restaurants over the years sampling the pho. This was my first time at Saigon kitchen and I ordered  pho tai. What I got was canned chicken broth (pho ga) with beef slices. It seems that areas where there is little competition this is a common practice of Vietnamese restaurant owners. They produce mediocre. They do this because it is cheaper, less time consuming and the public will never know. Therefore, the public won't demand better. My favorite Vietnamese restaurants are on Central ave. in Albany NY and at a famous Vietnamese bakery in East New Orleans, LA that also has a restaurant. Once you have been to a good restaurant it makes all others pale. Real pho tai you will never forget. Rich layered beef broth from bones simmered in spices for hours ---is very time consuming. Then the easy part fresh herbs, sliced beef and veggies is added to that. Real pho tai is a complex taste not possible from canned chicken broth. Sorry Saigon Kitchen your atmosphere was upscale, service was great and the place was packed but the pho tai was lacking in the flavor that I have acquired a taste for. Also, the summer rolls were bland without mint, cilantro or carrots. It is unfortunate that the owner cannot even get his/her canned broths straight with the menu! If only the owner would give you the real thing there would be lines around the block!
This place was one of the first places I tried when I arrived in Ithaca about a month ago. I was worried about the quality because everyone before arriving, I was told I would never find good Asian food in town. This place changed my mind immediately. It more than exceeded the expectations and was pretty comparable to what I've had back home. You don't get an option on the bowl size, but they do give you a big bowl. The pho here is a little more expensive than what I'm used to paying at home. But it's not unreasonable; appetizers are actually cheaper than what I've seen at other places, and almost all entrees are under $10. Service is good and very attentive. The place looks like it's always pretty busy but it doesn't ever look like people have to wait to be seated. I just wish that it was a bit closer to campus so I could get it between classes.
Maybe my husband and I ordered the wrong thing, but we both found the food to be bland and tasteless--though we ordered things on the "house specialties" part of the menu.
Pre- feastgiving eve meal, oh where it all begins...... the squid appetizer was tender, thick and lightly fried pho tai was tasty, the plate of bean sprouts and basil was slight lightly fried general chicken had a nice accompaniment of broccoli with lightly flavored sauce tofu lo mein was pretty standard, more veg and more veg variety would have been appreciated spicy eggplant was not all edible, but I would ratchet up the heat index on the items or orders something different
Seriously so delicious and they have many vegetarian options, it's great.  The price is good too.  My only big complaint is that they seem to like to add cilantro to everything even when it's not listed on the menu.  I just say "no cilantro" every time I order, and they are good at keeping it off.  They do get really crowded though, so if you're going to dinner, don't wait until you're ready to pass out from hunger.
Ugh...got the combo pho and the beef was cooked too much, making it very tough and chewy... the broth however is good. Not comparable to the pho in Little Saigon, but hits the spot after a long night of drinking.

I just didn't get it. Where's the mind blowing pho?! I was excited to come here based on all the ecstatic reviews. Walking in, I thought the place had a nice unassuming interior and around 3 or 4pm it seemed like nearly all the tables were full, only one or two left so this is a pretty hot spot among locals. We were seated and eventually had our order taken. The service was OK, although my water was not refilled enough. The waitress seemed nice and had a sense of humor with us, which some may have found a bit cross but we enjoyed it (e.g. can I have some more water please? Nope, you can't!). I ended up ordering a cup of the Saigon Soup, which had pineapple, celery, red peppers, choice of protein (I chose fish) and other flavors. It was pretty good and had a lot of heat that hit right up to the back of my throat. My sister had pho for the first time (I was excited for her to try it) and I ended up trying a good bit of it and we both agreed that it wasn't very good, which considering all the expectations set by the previous reviews was a huge disappointment. The broth was served warm (not hot) and the beef as a previous reviewer mentioned was cut into pieces too large and was overcooked. There was simply not enough flavor in the broth, all the flavor would come from the sauces you would add yourself, but there needs to be more! My fiance had the Kan Pao, which consisted of grilled veggies and she choice tofu for her protein. I tried it and thought it was delicious and she was very satisfied with her meal. I don't think this is a bad place, just that my experience with the pho was "Meh." I would have also appreciated my water being constantly refilled, but I understand they had a pretty full house at the time so it may not have been easy.
I LOVEEEE this place. The traditional vietnamesse meat soup with carrots is to die for
Well to start off there was a photo of a very friendly looking Vietnamese woman on the wall. I'm just assuming she was Vietnamese, but I'm not really sure. This is a Vietnamese restaurant after all. Anyway, I got the bun ton nuong with chicken. I am not really 100% sure if that's what I got. Whatever, it was good. And it tasted fre $ h.

It's pho-king good. All jokes aside, I will say that for Ithaca and this part of New York where good Asian food seems to be scarce, Saigon has it down. Taste is excellent. Food and restaurant is clean. The broth is cleaner than other places that serve pho in this area, including Syracuse. I always get their pho and calamari. Calamari is something special. Fried to perfection and the batter they use is yummy. Their siracha chicken is great but I don't order that as often because I can't resist the calamari. I ate here practically all summer while I was in Ithaca.
We have been there a number of times for both lunch and dinner.  The food has never disappointed.  My wife loves the Saigon Curry.  I am a fan of the Pho.  Very affordable.
Food here is pretty delicious. Nice and friendly staff. One criticism is that some of their food is on the sweeter side than authentic . Pho tasted a little too sweet. But overall delicious
I LOVEEEE this place. The traditional vietnamesse meat soup with carrots is to die for
Best Vietnamese food I've ever tasted! Moreover, it feels like it's amazingly fresh. You walk out feeling that you just ate your mom's cooking, fresh tasty, not overdone on spices. The pho soup is to die for. Highly recommended.
Yum! Yum! Yum!  Try the jungle fried rice!!  So good!
Pretty much one of the only restaurants in Ithaca that I like. Definitely the best Asian restaurant in Ithaca. The pho here actually tastes like authentic pho. I would recommend Saigon Kitchen to anyone in the area, it is a much needed establishment there. However, I'm used to paying 6.50 for a large bowl of pho.. whereas it costs upward of $9 for a bowl. The menu is also very Americanized. But that is understandable since it is Ithaca. Therefore, I find myself giving Saigon sympathy points.. it would be nothing special in a city (3 stars).

A friend recommended this place. At first, I was skeptical. A real Vietnamese Pho restaurant in Ithaca? Absolutely was not disappointed. Been back twice in one week. Need I say more! I just hope that it won't get so crowded that there will be a long wait in the future.
Sorry, just not a fan of their pho. The amount of MSG they put in the pho was almost killing me, I have never felt so thirsty after a meal and the beef they put in the pho was too thick and way over-cooked.
Yum! Yum! Yum!  Try the jungle fried rice!!  So good!

we keep coming back!  says it all!
We came down from a long drive to this place  and were really looking forward to some good food . And I must say we were not disappointed . I am a pure vegetarian and Saigon had Buddha dishes on their Menu ,which had good options .  I started with a cup of vegetable soup which was a light and tasty . Had summer rolls as appetizer ,worth a try . If you have a sweet tooth then you will definitely like the peanut sauce which comes with the rolls . For the main course I had Buddha stir fry ( portions are good enough for one person ) . This dish would have tasted better if the sauce would not have been that sweet . I would have preferred more on the salt and spice  side rather on the sweet side . My husband had chicken with  yellow curry and he really loved it . He found it much better than many of the Thai/Asian places he tried so far . So all the chicken lovers , I will recommend to go for it . Service was good and they provide 4 types of different sauces on your table so that you can make your dishes as spicy as you wish . I  will definitely recommend to dine at this place .

best pho in ithaca if not the upstate ny.
A few dissapointments on our first visit to this highly rated restsursnt. it began with the server adding place settings to our table before we were advised we would need move to another table to accommodate a larger group. We are big fans of summer rolls and Bun so we ordered both for our dinner. The summer rolls were ordered with shrimp. They were  fresh but lacked cilanto but filled with rice noodles. They were quite bland. Our vietnamese iced coffee with condensed milk came already prepared. We are accustomed to having the hot expresso in a drip maker with a glass with the condensed milk in it so you make it yourself. The Bun was the best part of the meal.. We ordered the lemongrass version with grilled pork. There were lots of veggies and a delicious sauce but unfortunately the thai basil was pretty black and inedible except for one leaf. Lastly, we felt rushed to finish our meal when one of our plates was removed as the other person was still eating.  I understand they were very busy but all customers should be treated with respect. We were not asked if we wanted anything else such as dessert but handed the bill. Oh well, its a college town full of college kids so what aew you going to do?
we keep coming back!  says it all!

I'm from the MD/DC area, where there are Pho restaurants lining streets, and the pho there is perfect and absolutely delicious, providing the perfect broth, and bean sprouts, lime, and basil leaves on the side. I never thought that Ithaca had a good pho place at all in my 4 years living here, and was pretty much deprived of good pho. Saigon Kitchen was suggested to me by my boyfriend and after giving it a try, we loved it! The first time (and so far only time) we went, it was around 6 on a Saturday and the place was packed. Luckily, we were able to get seated within 5 or 10 minutes, so maybe getting there around that time or a little earlier would be ideal. Some people who arrived later had to wait a little longer than we did. We started out with the summer rolls as an appetizer which I was a big fan of since I love summer rolls, though it might have had more noodle than other parts, like shrimp, that I would want more of. Then, we both ordered pho (beef broth noodle soups, as opposed to the pho ga - chicken broth), and WE BOTH THOUGHT IT WAS AMAZING. Almost exactly the broth from MD, and the bean sprouts etc on the side. The menu has a bunch of items other than pho (stirfried food, vegetarian dishes...can't remember all off the top of my head). As for price, it was slightly more expensive than the pho back at home ($8 vs. $6). I will admit, it isn't easy to find parking next to the restaurant. Parking along the streets, or parking a couple blocks down and walking might be the best option. BUT I SWEAR, I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE ELSE I WOULD GET PHO THIS GOOD IN ITHACA, so I would find any way to go to Saigon Kitchen and I just don't even care that it's slightly more expensive than I'm used to. Totally worth it. Of course, it's always good on a super cold day/night as Ithaca often gives us. They also sell bubble tea (smoothie style) which is great - the tapioca is cooked perfectly and the texture of the tea is very smooth. We tried the avocado bubble tea, a flavor I had never tried before so I didn't have any other avocado bubble tea to compare it to, but it wasn't bad. Interesting to use this as a bubble tea flavor! Definitely able to taste the avocado flavor, and also a little sweet. I will say, my boyfriend enjoyed it a lot more than I did, probably because I prefer fruity flavors. Anyway, we've only been to Saigon Kitchen once, but we will definitely be making more trips this winter for some deelish pho! And I hope to try some of their other dishes. Hopefully, the snow won't get in our way too much later!
Veggie Spring Roll Vermicelli FTW! (Who doesn't want veggies, noodles, sauce, with cut up spring rolls on top??) So delicious!! Also, I love that the hoisin sauce is just on the table.... I don't think I've ever seen hoisin sauce so free flowing at a restaurant before! I also got the steamed veggie dumplings- very good! Great tangy dipping sauce with those (saved the extra sauce for my vermicelli.... can't go wrong here! I saw some people get the drinks here... Avocado smoothie?! Looks awesome, but I was too full... next time...
This place is still super overrated, but I have to recommend the beef stew. It's actually way better than the pho.
Went on a Sunday afternoon and hardly had a wait at all.  The food is authentic and is absolutely delicious.  The only true Vietnamese style food in Ithaca, the prices are reasonable and it has a nice family atmosphere.  The only problem is a lack of parking around here, so you might want to send in a family member to get your name on the waiting list while you find parking!

The service has improved each time I've been here, which means the service is now tolerable, but not excellent.  The food continues to be the best Vietnamese in Ithaca, and the last few bubble teas were better and the tapioca was less overcooked.

Nothing too special but it is one of the better Vietnamse restaurants in Ithaca. The broth of the chicken pho didn't have that meaty taste and was light and pretty flavourful.  The beef rice vermicelli  won't disappoint. The mango juice was not the freshly squeezed but rather from a can and just too sweet. Avoid the regular brunch, lunch or dinner hours to avoid the long wait. Even though it was a chilly day, it was stuffy and hot inside. Try wearing a short sleeve!
Went for dinner on 4/21. The service needs much improvement. Our drink orders weren't received before the meal. We had to remind the server that we ordered beverages and what they were.  Each meal was brought to the table at a different time, leaving us all waiting for the last person to get their meal while our food got cold. I got the vegetarian pho which came with only 3 small pieces of tofu. I had to ask for more. We would've considered dessert had we been asked if we wanted it, but we were just given the check without a thank you. The food was average but the service was poor. I would not recommend this place for dinner when you want to feel catered to. It was more work than I want when I go out to dinner.  It's more suited for lunch or take-out.
Went again last weekend and again I couldn't be more pleased. The pho was as amazing as ever and the service was good. My wife ordered the Honey Lemongrass chicken. The portion was actually quite small and came with rice. She and I liked it, good flavor, but probably wouldn't order it again as she was still hungry and attacked my pho after she was done haha. I tried the Imperial Roll too which was good, definitely order it again. I like that they are consistent with their food though, this is definitely a place to keep coming back to!
This place is still super overrated, but I have to recommend the beef stew. It's actually way better than the pho.
Food here is pretty delicious. Nice and friendly staff. One criticism is that some of their food is on the sweeter side than authentic . Pho tasted a little too sweet. But overall delicious
We went to Saigon Kitchen for lunch today for the first time. By 12 noon, the place was almost full (Sunday). We had the Hot and Sour Soup, Wonton Soup, Chicken Curry, and the Steak Vietnamese which was very good. The restaurant was well decorated and most importantly CLEAN. The men's room as clean as well. The vast majority of the customers were asian. A very good sign!
Despite a long wait, the food here was delicious. I ordered the fried calamari that was very fresh and very very yummy, This place might have the best food in Ithaca but the service is not spectacular. I ordered the coconut drink which came at the same time as my food, and when it did, it was nothing to rave about. I do recommend this place but if you are coming here during peak hours make sure to set aside some time to wait by walking around the common. Also: I went to the Saigon kitchen booth during apple fest that was very very disappointing but that is aside from the point.
The service has improved each time I've been here, which means the service is now tolerable, but not excellent.  The food continues to be the best Vietnamese in Ithaca, and the last few bubble teas were better and the tapioca was less overcooked.
Best Vietnamese food I've ever tasted! Moreover, it feels like it's amazingly fresh. You walk out feeling that you just ate your mom's cooking, fresh tasty, not overdone on spices. The pho soup is to die for. Highly recommended.
Good Asian food. Recommend their lo mein.
+ Pho was really good! They don't have size options, so the portion was huge, but the quality was still great. You can tell that it's fresh, and so are the side ingredients (basil, bean sprouts, lime). + Food came out quickly + Server was really nice and provided us a lot more limes when we asked. - Shrimp summer rolls was okay. Kind of bland even with the sauce, and stuffed too many noodles compared to shrimp. - Iced Vietnamese Creamed Coffee was so, so bad. It was outrageously sweet I felt like they dumped syrup in it, that even diluting it with more cold water didn't help. Pho is definitely the star dish here. If I lived in Ithaca or went to Cornell, I'd definitely come back and eat here more often.
Went for dinner on 4/21. The service needs much improvement. Our drink orders weren't received before the meal. We had to remind the server that we ordered beverages and what they were.  Each meal was brought to the table at a different time, leaving us all waiting for the last person to get their meal while our food got cold. I got the vegetarian pho which came with only 3 small pieces of tofu. I had to ask for more. We would've considered dessert had we been asked if we wanted it, but we were just given the check without a thank you. The food was average but the service was poor. I would not recommend this place for dinner when you want to feel catered to. It was more work than I want when I go out to dinner.  It's more suited for lunch or take-out.
Pretty much one of the only restaurants in Ithaca that I like. Definitely the best Asian restaurant in Ithaca. The pho here actually tastes like authentic pho. I would recommend Saigon Kitchen to anyone in the area, it is a much needed establishment there. However, I'm used to paying 6.50 for a large bowl of pho.. whereas it costs upward of $9 for a bowl. The menu is also very Americanized. But that is understandable since it is Ithaca. Therefore, I find myself giving Saigon sympathy points.. it would be nothing special in a city (3 stars).
We went to Saigon Kitchen for lunch today for the first time. By 12 noon, the place was almost full (Sunday). We had the Hot and Sour Soup, Wonton Soup, Chicken Curry, and the Steak Vietnamese which was very good. The restaurant was well decorated and most importantly CLEAN. The men's room as clean as well. The vast majority of the customers were asian. A very good sign!
One of the best restaurants in Ithaca, however, food there isn't that great. The service is fast and the food is well priced.
Good Asian food. Recommend their lo mein.
Sorry, just not a fan of their pho. The amount of MSG they put in the pho was almost killing me, I have never felt so thirsty after a meal and the beef they put in the pho was too thick and way over-cooked.
Stopped in Saturday night, and there was a line out the door.  We waited 25 minutes for a table which was not bad at all.  The waitresses were very efficient.  I had the lemon basil stir fry with pork, and my fiance had the saigon kitchen curry with seafood.  Both dishes were fantastic!
We came down from a long drive to this place  and were really looking forward to some good food . And I must say we were not disappointed . I am a pure vegetarian and Saigon had Buddha dishes on their Menu ,which had good options .  I started with a cup of vegetable soup which was a light and tasty . Had summer rolls as appetizer ,worth a try . If you have a sweet tooth then you will definitely like the peanut sauce which comes with the rolls . For the main course I had Buddha stir fry ( portions are good enough for one person ) . This dish would have tasted better if the sauce would not have been that sweet . I would have preferred more on the salt and spice  side rather on the sweet side . My husband had chicken with  yellow curry and he really loved it . He found it much better than many of the Thai/Asian places he tried so far . So all the chicken lovers , I will recommend to go for it . Service was good and they provide 4 types of different sauces on your table so that you can make your dishes as spicy as you wish . I  will definitely recommend to dine at this place .
Best pho in ithaca, hands down. Good and relatively quick service. Hard to get seats for a reason, no reservations taken. People love the House Special and why wouldn't they? It is fantastic. *Don't get takeout, everything comes uber raw, and in like 4 different bags of ingredients. As Sheldon would say: food made to order with some assembly required.
A few dissapointments on our first visit to this highly rated restsursnt. it began with the server adding place settings to our table before we were advised we would need move to another table to accommodate a larger group. We are big fans of summer rolls and Bun so we ordered both for our dinner. The summer rolls were ordered with shrimp. They were  fresh but lacked cilanto but filled with rice noodles. They were quite bland. Our vietnamese iced coffee with condensed milk came already prepared. We are accustomed to having the hot expresso in a drip maker with a glass with the condensed milk in it so you make it yourself. The Bun was the best part of the meal.. We ordered the lemongrass version with grilled pork. There were lots of veggies and a delicious sauce but unfortunately the thai basil was pretty black and inedible except for one leaf. Lastly, we felt rushed to finish our meal when one of our plates was removed as the other person was still eating.  I understand they were very busy but all customers should be treated with respect. We were not asked if we wanted anything else such as dessert but handed the bill. Oh well, its a college town full of college kids so what aew you going to do?
The one and only place I've been to for Pho in Ithaca. Not too shabby, but not worth the hype. The Grub -- * Pho Tai Gan ($7.95) - Rare Eye Round Steak and Tendon Venue Review -- Saigon Kitchen's layout is simple, inviting, and relaxing. This place is cozy, which you'll be hard pressed to find in a Vietnamese restaurant. The tables are uniformly neat and the place is bright with light colored wood paneling and large canvas prints spanning the walls. Food Review -- Pile on the sprouts, flood the bowl with sriracha, and every bowl of pho tastes the same to me. What can I say? I'm not the best critic when it comes to pho. Don't get me wrong, I love a good bowl of hot noodles in tasty broth, but one bowl never seems to beat out the rest. At Saigon Kitchen, the pho is served just right: hot, noodles are soft and chewy but not al dente, a few pieces of beef/tendon here and there, and voila! You've got your pho. In truth, I could've used some (*cough* A LOT) more beef and tendon, but the prices are great when compared to those of neighboring restaurants so I can't complain there! Service Review -- Service was minimal. We didn't have our water glasses refilled and my friends who had been here previously said that the pho took longer than usual to come out (supposedly it's normally instantaneous), but the ten minute wait wasn't bad at all. Overall Impression -- As previously mentioned, I'm not particularly a maven when it comes to pho. Perhaps I've just been blessed to have never experienced bad pho? Regardless, Saigon Kitchen is too far to frequent and students will have to take a drive albeit a short one to reach the restaurant.
Veggie Spring Roll Vermicelli FTW! (Who doesn't want veggies, noodles, sauce, with cut up spring rolls on top??) So delicious!! Also, I love that the hoisin sauce is just on the table.... I don't think I've ever seen hoisin sauce so free flowing at a restaurant before! I also got the steamed veggie dumplings- very good! Great tangy dipping sauce with those (saved the extra sauce for my vermicelli.... can't go wrong here! I saw some people get the drinks here... Avocado smoothie?! Looks awesome, but I was too full... next time...
Liked the food. service meh
Went on a Sunday afternoon and hardly had a wait at all.  The food is authentic and is absolutely delicious.  The only true Vietnamese style food in Ithaca, the prices are reasonable and it has a nice family atmosphere.  The only problem is a lack of parking around here, so you might want to send in a family member to get your name on the waiting list while you find parking!
I'm a regular at this restaurant - really can't ask for more than absolutely mind-blowing pho and lemon-grass vermicelli. I can't say enough good things about the pork dishes; they know how to grill it well and the savory add to any of their dishes make it a win every time. If you can't do pork, go with the chicken; it's almost as good and definitely better than the beef. The noise level in here can be loud, as they're always busy. You can almost always expect a wait to be seated as everyone in town knows what a great place this is and they only seat about 40 people. Come early, and don't come on a Monday because that's the day they're closed!
Nothing too special but it is one of the better Vietnamse restaurants in Ithaca. The broth of the chicken pho didn't have that meaty taste and was light and pretty flavourful.  The beef rice vermicelli  won't disappoint. The mango juice was not the freshly squeezed but rather from a can and just too sweet. Avoid the regular brunch, lunch or dinner hours to avoid the long wait. Even though it was a chilly day, it was stuffy and hot inside. Try wearing a short sleeve!
I am new to the Ithaca area, but will be spending about half of my time here, due to a new job. And I have to say that Saigon Kitchen was the first restaurant that gave me culinary hope for Ithaca!! My first sip of young coconut juice and I heard a chorus of angels sing!! Pros: The food is authentic and excellent. The service is friendly. The chef is to be applauded for delicious flavor profiles. Cons: The space is small and quickly becomes crowded. Wait staff has a tendency to "linger" if you are too slow to leave, but given the waiting crowds, this isn't surprising. While they excel at authentic dishes, attempts at more Americanized fare like Crab Rangoon is a little lackluster at times. MUST TRY: The Tai Pho, the young coconut juice with pulp!
Went again last weekend and again I couldn't be more pleased. The pho was as amazing as ever and the service was good. My wife ordered the Honey Lemongrass chicken. The portion was actually quite small and came with rice. She and I liked it, good flavor, but probably wouldn't order it again as she was still hungry and attacked my pho after she was done haha. I tried the Imperial Roll too which was good, definitely order it again. I like that they are consistent with their food though, this is definitely a place to keep coming back to!
I'm vietnamese and I give this place a 2 thumbs up.  'Nuf said right?  Great pho and service was awesome.  Everything we ordered was tasty.   Was visiting the hubs family in the area and had a wicked craving for pho.  Went here and was skeptical because I'm so use to eating the best of viet food being from the lil Saigon area of OC.  This place did not let me down!  We ordered the summer, spring rolls, and pho.  Everything was Delish.  This was also my in laws first time trying viet food, so I'm so glad this place didn't embarrass me!  Lol.  Great job, and I hope to revisit on our next trip!
Despite a long wait, the food here was delicious. I ordered the fried calamari that was very fresh and very very yummy, This place might have the best food in Ithaca but the service is not spectacular. I ordered the coconut drink which came at the same time as my food, and when it did, it was nothing to rave about. I do recommend this place but if you are coming here during peak hours make sure to set aside some time to wait by walking around the common. Also: I went to the Saigon kitchen booth during apple fest that was very very disappointing but that is aside from the point.
Who would have expected to find a great Vietnamese restaurant in Ithaca!  But here it is.  It is byob.  On Friday an Saturday nights expect to wait up to 30 minutes.  It is well worth it. The portions are huge.  Well spiced.  Love it!
+ Pho was really good! They don't have size options, so the portion was huge, but the quality was still great. You can tell that it's fresh, and so are the side ingredients (basil, bean sprouts, lime). + Food came out quickly + Server was really nice and provided us a lot more limes when we asked. - Shrimp summer rolls was okay. Kind of bland even with the sauce, and stuffed too many noodles compared to shrimp. - Iced Vietnamese Creamed Coffee was so, so bad. It was outrageously sweet I felt like they dumped syrup in it, that even diluting it with more cold water didn't help. Pho is definitely the star dish here. If I lived in Ithaca or went to Cornell, I'd definitely come back and eat here more often.
My girlfriend and I made it down here after wanting to check this place out for a long time. I have heard many great things about Saigon Kitchen and did not disappoint. When we got into the restaurant, we were promptly seated and looked over the menu. For appetizers we got the crab rangoon and potstickers. The Crab Rangoon was the best I have ever had crispy fried wonton on the outside with warm crab and cream cheese on the inside. Simply delightful and the Potstickers were steamed to perfection and delicious. I got the House Special Pho and my girlfriend got the Tai Gau. The broths were flavorful and delicious. Every aspect of the soup - the meat, pho noodles, bean sprouts and Thai Basil were all fresh and made it an excellent dinner for us. This dinner was excellent and did not burn a hole on my wallet! I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for excellent Vietnamese food
One of the best restaurants in Ithaca, however, food there isn't that great. The service is fast and the food is well priced.
Some good stuff -- my favorite casual restaurant in Ithaca. And BYOB! Kid-friendly.
I thought the food was good, although i wasn't very happy with what i ordered. Don't know what it's called, but it's a plate of rice, egg, pork chop, and veggies. Pork chop was not the best, but everything else was good. The rest of my family seemed to enjoy their dishes. My dad loved his pho, said he would give it 4 stars. Might go again, but I think I'll order something else next time.

The wait was HORRENDOUS on the Friday night that I went, but that might have been because someone was having a 25-person birthday dinner and took up literally a third of the tables. The pho is pretty good, as good as the pho I've had in NYC, and they give generous portions of the add-in ingredients (a lot of bean sprouts). I wouldn't be surprised if this is the most authentic Asian food you can find in Ithaca.

What can I say? I've been to this place a number of times already and it has never let me down. Sure, the service can be a bit slow at times, but it's understandable since the place is always packed. And there's a good reason this place is packed every day of the week, the food is excellent. I've tried a number of things here from the curry to the pho, and wow do I love the pho. The broth by itself is absolutely delicious. I could eat just that and I would be happy. All the meat options you can choose from are excellent. The sliced steak and brisket are juicy and delicious. The tendon and meatballs are also really good. I have a hard time deciding which ones I want so I usually get a combination of all of them. I also really love their fried squid appetizer. If you haven't tried it, let me tell you, it is some of the best fried squid I have ever had. It's crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.

Other than that though all of the boba flavors I've tried have been really tasty and I love the tapioca balls at the bottom . :D Overall, a really good restaurant. I encourage you to not only try the pho, but to venture out and try some of their other dishes as well. You will not be disappointed.

After a fairly short wait for a table for two, we sat at the second most recommended place in Ithaca for New York City dwellers to chow down at. Bright, and bustling, this BYOB place isn't packed for the decor. We started with the "ruckus" shrimp, crunchy and super tasty in a sweet sauce. Delish. The crystal shrimp and pot stickers were also amazingly fresh and as good as any top-notch dim sum place I have eaten at. My girlfriend got the amazing Pho, fresh, and perfectly done, the soup was very tasty. Usually she orders the better tasting dish as I try different things often. I won. The Saigon Flounder was crunchy and delicate and melt in your mouth good. I am going to try this dish now in NYC at my personal favorite here, the Saigon Grill. For 3 Appetizers, a beef pho and a menu special the total was around $35.00 now THAT was a good deal.

I had a delicious lunch there off the lunch menu (shrimp curry thing). Staff extremely friendly and welcoming. The food came fast and it seems like it's a favourite to a lot of people. Not the best neighborhood though.
I'm vietnamese and I give this place a 2 thumbs up.  'Nuf said right?  Great pho and service was awesome.  Everything we ordered was tasty.   Was visiting the hubs family in the area and had a wicked craving for pho.  Went here and was skeptical because I'm so use to eating the best of viet food being from the lil Saigon area of OC.  This place did not let me down!  We ordered the summer, spring rolls, and pho.  Everything was Delish.  This was also my in laws first time trying viet food, so I'm so glad this place didn't embarrass me!  Lol.  Great job, and I hope to revisit on our next trip!
Not much for atmosphere, but the food is the real deal. If you've ever had good vietnamese food, you know it can be great. If you haven't, get to Saigon Kitchen.  They'll open your eyes. I had the spicy black bean and ginger flounder. WOW. Can't wait to go back.
Who would have expected to find a great Vietnamese restaurant in Ithaca!  But here it is.  It is byob.  On Friday an Saturday nights expect to wait up to 30 minutes.  It is well worth it. The portions are huge.  Well spiced.  Love it!
This place opened up in the past several months, and I truly wish that this place opened up 6 years ago when I first came to Ithaca for school. But first things first. I am Vietnamese. I know what I am talking about, and I rarely write reviews on Yelp but this time I have to, just to do everybody else a favor, especially those who aren't aware of this place yet. Ironically, I only found out about this place after smelling pho while strolling in The Commons but I knew that the only place was in Collegetown. Went home and did some research - sure enough, there was a new place that opened up a month ago! When compared to the other place in Collegetown, this place BLOWS the other one out of the water. No comparison, at all, hands down. DO NOT EVER go to the Collegetown place EVER again. The one in Colelgetown, poorly named Vietnam Restaurant, was below average but was better than nothing without any competitors around. Actually, the Vietnam Restaurant has decent bun but when you are talking about the staple dish, pho, there is no comparison. This is due to the simple fact that the chefs behind Vietnam Restaurant are actually Chinese - Cantonese refugees from Vietnam. On top of that, the pho they serve have been obviously influenced by their Chinese cooking (hey, they even share the same kitchen with their neighboring, Chinese restaurant, Hai Hong (which itself is actually quite good). Saigon actually gives you a side dish of bean sprouts, lime, and basil - which is the authentic way to go. If they wanted to up it a notch, they could have added sliced jalapenos and mint to that dish as well. Other places also have finely shredded onions on the side, too. More the merrier. Rachel S. below claimed the soup to be a little oilier than it should be - that's laughable. Seriously, it's REALLY good pho - and I've been to good ones in Montreal, just as good as this one in Ithaca! I am coming from California, where we are LOADED with Vietnamese restaurants, and this ranks up in the top 10. It's that good. Everything else has been "Americanized" down. For example, they serve you with forks and spoons. Seriously? Bring the chopsticks and white soup spoons - let the others ask for metal utensils. Or when they serve Vietnamese coffee, it's already pre-made. The authentic style brings out two glasses - one filled with only ice, the other with a couple spoonfuls of sweetened condensed milk on the bottom with a hot coffee dripper on top of the glass, actively dripping. You're supposed to mix the hot coffee/milk together after the drip finishes and then pour this into a glass of ice, then drink. Or that their lettuce in the vermicelli is too finely shredded. Speaking of vermicelli, they skimp on the sweet/sour sauce (which really serves as your basting soup for the dish). But the chefs speak Vietnamese, they obviously know how to anchor their staple Pho dish down, the place is ALWAYS packed with a line (remember this rule: if a restaurant is empty or near-empty, never eat there), and it's the same price as Vietnam Restaurant. Seriously good pho.

Tonight my family and I went here for dinner after my brother's graduation. Due to separate paths they were about to embark on, my brother had just broken up with his college girlfriend (somewhat mutually); not knowing Ithaca well, we went to Saigon Kitchen recommended by this girlfriend just yesterday. This was the stuff of Dawson's Creek; we walk in, and this now-ex-girlfriend's entire family is also waiting for a table. Oh shit. We should have known; it was her recommendation afterall. Both families chatted a bit, and turns out her parents are the nicest people. They get a table first; my family and I joke that this is the stuff from Dawson's Creek. 15 minutes later, our table is ready. Of course. Why wouldn't it be. Right next to her family. As we all awkwardly looked at each other, my dad exclaims, "Well why don't we just put the tables together!?!" We all ate happily ever after, and the bitter breakup turned into a "Let's talk later." ...So that's what Saigon Kitchen does to you. PS: Incredible customer service. Owner (I assume) Mr. Lam = SO AWESOME. Our server Vi = SO AWESOME. I am a stickler for great customer service, and they genuinely cared about their customers. In Mr. Lam's words (paraphrased), "I just want for you to be happy!" As a family of 5 (and 3-4 of us vegetarians) there were tons of options for us. Almost everything comes in beef, chicken, pork, shrimp, or tofu, and you can choose. I am very, very happy with Saigon Kitchen, and cannot wait to return when in Ithaca again.
Some good stuff -- my favorite casual restaurant in Ithaca. And BYOB! Kid-friendly.
I've been missing proper pho for a long time. Finally the Saigon Kitchen comes and brings me the taste of home I've been missing. The beef pho is the best because the broth is unlike any noodle soup base you've ever tasted. I got take-out because I live in Collegetown, but the delivery was pretty fast and the soup was still hot when it came. It was just like I remembered it! I am definitely ordering from here again.
I thought the food was good, although i wasn't very happy with what i ordered. Don't know what it's called, but it's a plate of rice, egg, pork chop, and veggies. Pork chop was not the best, but everything else was good. The rest of my family seemed to enjoy their dishes. My dad loved his pho, said he would give it 4 stars. Might go again, but I think I'll order something else next time.
I have a similarly named Viet Namese restaurant in my town called Saigon Cafe. I always get the Sub Gum pork and thought I'd order the same to compare. It was absolutely fantastic. Its a family run business and the owner is working hard. The staff was very friendly and a lot of fun. Don't ask to buy one of their t shits. Supposedly, they are only for the staff. Don't waste your time in Ithaca with the renowned restaurants that are riding on a vegetarian cookbook reputation. There's planty of veggie choices on this menu that will not disappoint. Another plus - if you didn't get enough during your evening meal, you can also find them at Ithaca's Farmer's Market.
The wait was HORRENDOUS on the Friday night that I went, but that might have been because someone was having a 25-person birthday dinner and took up literally a third of the tables. The pho is pretty good, as good as the pho I've had in NYC, and they give generous portions of the add-in ingredients (a lot of bean sprouts).

If they wanted to up it a notch, they could have added sliced jalapenos and mint to that dish as well. Other places also have finely shredded onions on the side, too. More the merrier. Rachel S. below claimed the soup to be a little oilier than it should be - that's laughable. Seriously, it's REALLY good pho - and I've been to good ones in Montreal, just as good as this one in Ithaca! I am coming from California, where we are LOADED with Vietnamese restaurants, and this ranks up in the top 10. It's that good. Everything else has been "Americanized" down. For example, they serve you with forks and spoons. Seriously? Bring the chopsticks and white soup spoons - let the others ask for metal utensils. Or when they serve Vietnamese coffee, it's already pre-made. The authentic style brings out two glasses - one filled with only ice, the other with a couple spoonfuls of sweetened condensed milk on the bottom with a hot coffee dripper on top of the glass, actively dripping. You're supposed to mix the hot coffee/milk together after the drip finishes and then pour this into a glass of ice, then drink. Or that their lettuce in the vermicelli is too finely shredded. Speaking of vermicelli, they skimp on the sweet/sour sauce (which really serves as your basting soup for the dish). But the chefs speak Vietnamese, they obviously know how to anchor their staple Pho dish down, the place is ALWAYS packed with a line (remember this rule: if a restaurant is empty or near-empty, never eat there), and it's the same price as Vietnam Restaurant. Seriously good pho.
Tonight my family and I went here for dinner after my brother's graduation. Due to separate paths they were about to embark on, my brother had just broken up with his college girlfriend (somewhat mutually); not knowing Ithaca well, we went to Saigon Kitchen recommended by this girlfriend just yesterday. This was the stuff of Dawson's Creek; we walk in, and this now-ex-girlfriend's entire family is also waiting for a table. Oh shit. We should have known; it was her recommendation afterall. Both families chatted a bit, and turns out her parents are the nicest people. They get a table first; my family and I joke that this is the stuff from Dawson's Creek. 15 minutes later, our table is ready. Of course. Why wouldn't it be. Right next to her family. As we all awkwardly looked at each other, my dad exclaims, "Well why don't we just put the tables together!?!" We all ate happily ever after, and the bitter breakup turned into a "Let's talk later." ...So that's what Saigon Kitchen does to you. PS: Incredible customer service. Owner (I assume) Mr. Lam = SO AWESOME. Our server Vi = SO AWESOME. I am a stickler for great customer service, and they genuinely cared about their customers. In Mr. Lam's words (paraphrased), "I just want for you to be happy!" As a family of 5 (and 3-4 of us vegetarians) there were tons of options for us. Almost everything comes in beef, chicken, pork, shrimp, or tofu, and you can choose. I am very, very happy with Saigon Kitchen, and cannot wait to return when in Ithaca again.
I've been missing proper pho for a long time. Finally the Saigon Kitchen comes and brings me the taste of home I've been missing. The beef pho is the best because the broth is unlike any noodle soup base you've ever tasted. I got take-out because I live in Collegetown, but the delivery was pretty fast and the soup was still hot when it came. It was just like I remembered it! I am definitely ordering from here again.
I have a similarly named Viet Namese restaurant in my town called Saigon Cafe. I always get the Sub Gum pork and thought I'd order the same to compare. It was absolutely fantastic. Its a family run business and the owner is working hard. The staff was very friendly and a lot of fun. Don't ask to buy one of their t shits. Supposedly, they are only for the staff. Don't waste your time in Ithaca with the renowned restaurants that are riding on a vegetarian cookbook reputation. There's planty of veggie choices on this menu that will not disappoint. Another plus - if you didn't get enough during your evening meal, you can also find them at Ithaca's Farmer's Market.
Saigon Kitchen isn't a hit or miss Vietnamese place: you know, the kind of place where the laminated four-page menu features 45 items, each one accompanied by a shady picture taken by the owner with a digital camera, and where an undisclosed half of the dishes are disappointing. While perhaps a bit more narrow in their focus, the fare cooked up at Saigon Kitchen is consistently delicious. And by that I primarily reference the pho, which Saigon Kitchen has a monopoly over given that there's no other place that serves tolerable pho in Ithaca. Other dishes are good as well for those insane, mind-bending moments when you don't crave pho; any of the vermicelli dishes, with their refreshing blend of noodles and veggies, come to mind as able to do the trick in such a topsy-turvy Twilight Zone. Altogether you've got a recipe for success in the form of Saigon Kitchen. Perhaps it is a case of too much success however, because you WILL wait to get a table here, especially if your party is larger than two.
Went in without reading the reviews and was BLOWN away. You can't swing a dead cat in Ithaca without hitting a decent Thai restaurant, now I have a new source of Vietnamese/Chinese cuisine.  The packed restaurant was a testament to the meal we were about to enjoy. Started with the steamed pot stickers (pork). They were good but not great. Then onto lemongrass marinated skewers, both steak and chicken. OMG my mouth has died and gone to heaven. Delicious. Even though they advertise themselves as Vietnamese, I tried the Spicy Szechuan lunch special as I have been in searching in vain for good Chinese cuisine in Ithaca. It did not disappoint. Made with perfectly cooked vegetables and mild/medium spice, the chicken was tender and flavorful. Eureka, they had me with this dish. The accompanying spring roll was cold and uninspiring, but I was willing to cut them slack because the rest of the dish was fantastic. Can't wait to return. Not the fanciest place, but a welcome addition to the local scene.
Love Saigon Kitchen! I've been here a couple dozen times and it is always delicious. Best things about this place: ingredients are fresh (you can taste the difference) and the prices are Very Affordable. Four people can eat well for the price that two people might pay at some other local restaurants. Anyhoo, I can recommend either the Pork Honey Lemongrass Bun/Vermicelli (my all-time fave) or the Pho Ga. The pork vermicelli is kinda like a noodle salad. It comes with finely shredded lettuce, rice noodles, bean sprouts, crushed peanuts, the pork and the dressing. I've only had this type of dish here, but I like it A Lot. The Pho Ga is like a chicken noodle soup. Both are very excellent. The veggie spring rolls are good too. And the limeade is refreshing, tart and (sometimes) a bit too sweet, but still pretty nice. Be prepared that they usually have a line during the peak lunch time and from the start of "dinner time" until closing , but if you go right when they open or for a late lunch, you should be fine. They have a pretty fast turn over too. If you're trying to find a place where you can sit around for hours chatting with your tablemates, this is not the place. They want your table and frankly so do I, because I'm probably in that line of people waiting to eat some good food! Try this place! You'll probably like it.
FINALLY.  Pho in Ithaca. For those who have been here for a while, you know that pho in Ithaca has been non-existent.  Sure, Collegetown has a "Vietnamese" restaurant with "pho," which strangely consists of the most un-pho-like concoction that I have ever seen.  Cabbage?  In pho?  Er... Saigon Kitchen finally brings a respectable pho to the table.  It's decent, it's reasonably priced, and it has all of the fresh accompaniments that except to find.  Granted, it's not nearly as good as pho that you might except to find in Vietnamese hot spots like the west coast or DC, but come on.  This is Ithaca, where a Vietnamese restaurant by name only continues to thrive in Collegetown.  I'm still scratching my head over that one...
Atmosphere - The ac is very high! I was freezing!! Very spacious, music is low. Staff- Very friendly but slow. Starter: Tofu Summer roll - Just like your average summer roll but their peanut sauce is not vegan so I didn't get to dip it with the peanut sauce which kills the summer rolll Entree: Vegan tofu and vegetable vermicelli with spring roll - the spring roll cost an extra dollar and you only get one piece cut into 4 which is not worth it! It taste good but that is pretty costly for one small spring roll. The dish was nicely presented and organized but I wish they gave more tofu. The sauce wasn't that amazing viet sauce I look forward to for vermicelli dishes. Overall - not bad for viet food, I would come again.

My friends and I were so excited to check out this recently opened Vietnamese restaurant.  We started with the chicken summer rolls and crispy calamari appetizers.  Both were quite tasty.  One of the owners brought us a complimentary order of Vietnamese imperial rolls which were amazing!   For dinner, two of us had the pho which received high praise.  I'm definitely not a pho expert but i tasted my hubby's broth and really liked it.  I found it to be sweeter than others I've had in the past with a very mellow star anise flavor.  Another friend ordered the Vietnamese steak which was also delicious.  The meat was cubed and sauteed in a sweet and flavorful brown sauce.  I ordered the vermicelli with grilled Saigon pork patties which was excellent!  The pork patties were delicious and a great compliment to the noodles and other fresh ingredients.  I especially liked that it wasn't just a giant bowls of noodles.  The ratio between fresh herbs, lettuce, carrots and noodles was perfect.   The interior is very modern and clean.  They did a great job with renovations.  The service is quick and attentive even though they're still trying to find their groove.  We will definitely be back!

I was down in Ithaca and visited Saigon Kitchen yesterday after reading several positive reviews. I was not disappointed. The restaurant is very clean and absolutely packed by noon, so I knew it was gong to be great. I ended up getting the crispy squid appetizer which was delicious. The breading is light and not very greasy which is a big plus in my book! I'm not a big beef broth person so I picked the vegetarian pho. It's actually called Pho Chay but for some reason that reminds me of RuPaul's Drag Race and I can't say it without exclaiming, "Pho Chay, you stay!" The broth is light but flavorful. I tossed in the Thai basil and bean sprouts that are served on the side with a little bit of chili sauce and inhaled my giant bowl go pho. I probably was a little too heavy handed with the chili sauce because my mouth was on fire, but it gave it the kick I needed to clear my sinuses. I felt the pricing was very fair for the quality and portion size; and the service was very friendly. Ordinarily, I wouldn't have ordered/eaten so much but I knew I was working through dinner and this really kept me very full. I'd recommend splitting the squid since the bowl of pho is quite filling! I will definitely visit again the next time I'm in Ithaca!

This is THE place to go for pho in Ithaca. Period. I usually go for the house special pho, which has all of the goodies (rare steak slices, brisket, tendon, meatballs). Broth is rich and delicious. Could use some tripe and more meatballs...but maybe I'm just greedy. I've also had the pork chop and egg, and I thought it was mighty tasty and had perfectly runny sunny side up eggs. It is a small space, so be prepared for a wait even on weekdays (usually only 15-20 minutes so not a dealbreaker).

In this town this is seriously as good as it gets!  Consistently delicious! Note: they no longer deliver.

I've had their food twice now, once delivered and once dining in.  So far hubby and I have liked everything we've eaten - there's a freshness and vibrancy to everything that just feels very fulfilling without being heavy or salty.  I really liked a pho I had with rare steak and tendon - though the broth was quite sweet so I couldn't quite finish it.  Another favorite was their vietnamese salad, which was simple but just what I wanted for a light lunch.  We've also eaten some of the spring rolls and the Imperial rolls, which all were good but nothing special. I think it's the staff and owners that are really making everyone want to see this place succeed.  Very warm and welcoming, and they did a nice job renovating that small space in a way that makes sense for both the dine-in experience as well as having an efficient take-out service.  Their hard work shows and I hope it is rewarded. Sesame balls for dessert, yay!

FINALLY A PLACE THAT SERVES REAL PHO IN ITHACA! The broth was amazing, full of flavor and spices. Generous portions and okay prices. Staff was tentative and friendly. So far the best Vietnamese place in Ithaca! One major downside is the fact that they charge for tea.

I had the lemon basil stir fry with chicken - very delicious! The wait was about 25 minutes for two people but that's to be expected for a Friday night. The turnover of the restaurant is very quick and the service is speedy and professional. The hostess (possible owner) was very attentive toward us while waiting for a table, and made sure we were seated and settled in. I also tasted my roommate's Chow Fun, the noodles were AMAZING. Very tasty overall but I will be sure to call ahead for a table next time!

One of my best restaurant in Ithaca! The food is great, the price is great! This time, we actually went there with a Vietnamese friend and she goes to this restaurant often too! The house special pho was really great and large in portion. However, a bit too salty for me. The spring rolls and crispy squid were all very delicious. Oh and the best part was the avocado and jack-fruit smoothie! Definitely something I'll order every time. Sometimes the line might be really long, so get there early before 6 on friday and weekends.

Saigon Kitchen is one of the few restaurants in Ithaca with truly good food. I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area, and have eaten Vietnamese food my entire life. Saigon Kitchen did not disappoint. The first time I went, I got the pho dac biet, which was surprisingly tasty. Though it did not contain the traditional tripe, the broth was flavorful and its aroma was intoxicating. Though it wasn't the best pho I've ever had, I was surprised by how delicious it was, especially since one usually doesn't associate Vietnamese food with Ithaca. My husband got the rice plate with beef, and the meat was tender and full of flavor. Portions here are great as well. Since then, we've also had the vermicelli with grilled pork (yum), and the banh hoi noodles (these noodles are even thinner than the vermicelli, and have even more flavor. They're woven into little patties that are DELICIOUS). We've also tried the imperial meat rolls, chicken wings, and calamari, and were not disappointed. A surprisingly good restaurant find in Ithaca. I would definitely recommend.

I really don't understand why everyone is so crazy about this place. I have been there twice, went the second time because we all deserve second chances, but it hasn't impressed me. The best and probably the only good thing about this place is the price. And I think that is why everyone is crazy with this place. But, come on, we ALL can do better.

I CANNOT write ANYTHING negative about Saigon Kitchen!  I love this place!  I go about once a week (sometimes more).  I have tried around 15 different things on the menu, nothing has disappointed! The appetizer soups are great.  I like them all.  The vegetable has the crispiest snow peas I have ever had!  How do you keep snow peas crispy when cooked in a broth?  I don't know, but they do it!  All the entrees are great.  You can order them as spicy as you want (1 to 5).  There are also sauces on every table.  Sriracha, 2 kinds of pepper flake sauces and soy sauce are available.  The service is great.  It is always the same 5 or 6 people. Mom and Dad owners are always there.  They are so gracious and happy to see all of their guests.   The prices are right on.  They also have a take out section.

it's my first week in Ithaca and the first time I have eaten out here.  The place was extremely busy when I arrived at 8:30 pm.  A true sign that I was in for a great meal.  I ordered he Thai pho bo vein was excellent and the tofu spring rolls were pretty good too.  I really wanted to order two different dishes to try like the girl sitting a few seats over had done but I had a god idea I was going to really enjoy it and I would be back. On a side note I believe when any restaurant is that busy they should ask individual diners if they would like to join another party of one.  The worst they could say is no and maybe they might make a new friend.

Really top notch Vietnamese.  If this was in a big city, it'd be just as busy.  Love the pho, love the marinated beef, and the coffee and bobo drinks are great!   But what brings me back is the service.  I love the fact that the servers are so gracious and friendly.  There is care for your experience here, even though it's not a fancy place.  But overall, exceptional service and great food make this a clear winner in Ithaca.   I hope they decide to do delivery service soon!

I have been there 4 times now. The food is excellent and this is probably bar none the best asian food in Ithaca. However, all 4 visits have turned into disappointments with the absolutely dismal service. I would love to love this place, but they will need to improve the service for me to become a regular patron.
Delicious! Love the chicken fried rice.
It took a little while to get seated, but what can you expect at lunchtime midweek?  The food was good, especially compared to other Asian cuisine I've tried in Ithaca.  The service was better than what I've come to expect from most Asian restaurants.  I would definitely eat here again.

Went here twice in 3 months, ordered the nearly the same thing. The food is a simply amazing. The pho is godly. Service is excellent & BYOB. Can't wait to do it again.

Pretty good pho, excellent coffee! Had a shrimp platter, okay-ish. Good place for a nice little reunion with old friends
