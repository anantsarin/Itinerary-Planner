Thank God I found you 'Good Guys.' I recently returned home after 20 years in the Carolina's to find my favorite hometown pizzeria out of business. Fortunately some 'Good Guys' came to the rescue resurrecting my favorite childhood pizza memories with an exact duplicate of a style of pizza unique to North Tonawanda. No dine-in, no-frills, amazing quality, delicious pizza ... 5 thumbs up!

Competing with "Bad Guys Pizza" just across the street is a real battle. Bad Guys use every trick in the book and cut every corner (of the pie) and have their finger in every pie, and they also round up the number pi to 4. Unthinkable, right? Then there is "Wise Guys Pizza" on Hertel, who are very wise in that they steer well clear of the Good Guys - Bad Guys on Ruie in North Tonawanda. It's been a long, long time since I tried this pizza. I used to live in this area and the people I lived with would sometimes order it so I would try a slice here and there. I remember it being good, but I can't give it more (or less) than a 4 because my memory ends with saying that it is "good". I'm pretty sure it's typical Buffalo style pizza, which is probably some of the best you can get anywhere. It didn't stand out as being the best slice I ever had, but it also was delicious. Give it a try yourself and see what you think. Buffalo actually has the best Pizza in the world - check my "best Pizza in the world" list to see all the best Buffalo pizza places, lots of my choices are Buffalo based.

Good Guys has long been one of my favorite take-out pizza places in the Buffalo-Niagara area, and for good reason. If you like pizza that has a lot of everything, Good Guys is definitely your best option. The dough is thick and chewy, blanketed by a nice, sweetish layer of sauce. And the cheese, oh, the cheese. Its gooey warmth piles high on the dough and sauce base, forcing eaters to literally bite through it to get to the rest of the layers. So, so good. They won't do custom orders, but really, their standard recipe is more delicious than anything most people could come up with.  They also have delicious steak and cheese subs, which I get whenever a fatty, greasy mood hits me. I don't live close to Good Guys anymore, but sometimes I'll make the northerly trek out of the city to grab a tray for parties. Customer service is always good, and the parking is convenient. I see that a few other Yelpers have complained about it becoming over-crowded, but I've never had a problem with this and I've visited the establishment many, many times. There's nowhere to sit and eat, and you can't buy pizza by the slice. While this makes sense business-wise, being able to swing in and grab a slice would definitely bump Good Guys up to 5 stars for me. Still, you can't go wrong with their amazing pizza and fair prices.

Attention Pizza lovers of WNY: Call and place your order right now. Since moving to North Tonawanda over a year ago, Good Guys has been my go to for all my pizza cravings. I am not even sure how to describe it, its a hefty slice for sure. The sauce and the amount of cheese used is perfection. It reminds me of when my parents used to take me to Pizza Junction as a child only better! Everyone behind the counter is extremely friendly and efficient. I have yet to have a bad pie from here so I suggest if you haven't already, make the call!

With the demise of Pizza Junction and the real heart of what made Pizza Junction (Jay, Mike, Marc, Mario and all the pros) what it was here, there should be no question of who reigns supreme in the north towns.   There is no better pizza in all of Niagara or northern Erie County.  If you are within a 15 mile radius of Good Guys then you do yourself dis-justice if you go somewhere else. End of story, this place rocks.

There's New York City pizza and western NY pizza and somewhere in the middle we have Good Guys pizza. I'm not saying Good Guys is anything less than a slice of NYC pizza, far from it. Good Guys stands alone as a delicious, ooey gooey, melty, cheesy large pepperoni slice of goodness. GG's has perfect sauce and an abundance of cheese and the rarely found standard size ronis that I love so much. They don't deliver, but with pizza this good, they don't need to. I'd gladly drive across town for this yummy slice.

Everyone says that the cook from Pizza Junction now works here or owns the place or runs it or something.  They say that there were stylistic disagreements about pizza, and that Pizza Junction isn't the same now.  They say that if you loved Pizza Junction when you were a kid and feel like the Pizza Junction of today is not the same, that you have to go to Good Guys to get the pizza you remember. I don't know if any of that is true, but the pizza was very good, "junction" style (heavy slices that must be eaten with a knife and fork, loaded with cheese).  The wings were also really really good, like crazy good.  I don't even know why they were so good but they were so damn good.   There is no dining room.  Get your food to go or you will have to eat it in the parking lot.  In the snow.  It would be worth it though.

After Pizza Junction (now out of business) strayed from their old recipe for pizza and jacked up their prices, I gladly followed over to Good Guys. I am a frequent person there and definitely will wait all week to have a slice or two as my cheat meal. Their slices are sauced well, the cheese is laid on thick, and not to mention the crust is just as good as the rest of the slice. When you're not ordering pizza they have pretty good subs as well, but their french fries (steak fries) are absolutely awesome. I love them. Their wings are pretty meaty as well so if you want some wings with that pizza, I definitely recommend them as well.

Since Pizza Junction closed, this is the best pizza I can get when I'm visiting home.  This is what pizza tasted like when I was growing up, and it's still the way I want it to taste, but can't anywhere but here.  It's a filling pie, so if you're worried about trying to eat everything, you probably want to downsize from what you usually order.

Amazing! By far the best pizza in the tonawanda area maybe all of wny. You better love cheese though cause they pile it on. Make sure when u pick up your pizza that u keep it level on the ride home let it sit for about five minutes before u dive in. I pick mine up about ten mins after the say so that the cheese cools a bit before the ride home!

Good Guys Pizza is my favorite pizza place in Western New York. If you want a nice, thick, almost over the top pizza, you won't do wrong with Good Guys. They also make some pretty good salads, though the don't always follow your requests (frequently find onions on our salads where no onions are requested). They have the best blue cheese I have ever tasted. Try their barbecue chicken finger pizza, it is quite delicious. The sauce they use is tangy, the chicken is tender and crispy. They will not do custom requests on pizza, i.e. half bbq chicken, half hot sauce, even if you are willing to waive the possibility that it might not turn out. The side order of fries is massive, though it has occasionally been so hot it has melted a bit of the Styrofoam container lid. I think that about covers it. Definitely give them a try, and keep coming back for more!

For over 30 years now I've been hooked on the pizza these good guys have been making!  Absolutely the best pizza chefs who make the best pizza in the world as far as I'm concerned!  I no longer live in Western NY but stop in every time I'm in the area - well worth going out of your way for!

Great food!  Always good portions. Everything I have had from here is excellent.  Only complaint is location has bad parking and sometimes they have ridiculous wait times.

After a long long wait we got our half sheet of pepperoni and onions. There was about 3 pounds of cheese on this pie. I must say the crust was nice and buttery but they over did it with the toppings. Wouldn't go back...but then again I am from NJ where Pizza is king.
