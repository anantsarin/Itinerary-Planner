Yay!! I love the Cornell plantations! When the weather is nice, it's a perfect way to spend the day, looking at all the pretty greenery while getting some exercise.

A nice place to walk around almost any time of the year. The hills here are gentle so there's nothing difficult about this walk, so just come here to enjoy some nature. It would be best to visit in that brief window of fall foliage, but spring and summer are pretty nice too.

A famous location for weddings. Very easy to get lost though. Great for studying in a peaceful, quite, natural environment.

Nice little tour at 10 am gives an overview of the herb garden and orchards nearest HQ. If you want to explore the rest of the sprawling grounds you'll need to go it alone (and maybe even drive, if you're lazy like us). The view from the Newman Overlook is really nice.

I love the Plantations!  I realize that there are many parks out there, but this happens to be one that was less than a mile from the house where I spent the first eighteen years of my life.  In the winter the hills were fantastic for sledding when Ithaca still got enough snow on a regular basis to go sledding.  In the summer it was my mainstay for running and bike riding.  The loop around bebe lake is still one of my favorites.  The stretch of forest home drive that runs parallel is also a very scenic drive with the sort of gree tree canopy in the summer and fall folliage at its best come october.

What a beautiful arboretum/botanical gardens/nature preserve !!! We checked out the  amazing view at the 'Newman Overlook', located at one of the highest points in the arboretum and on the campus. We also walked to the 'Grossman and Houston Ponds' that support all kinds of water pants and wildlife. This place has so many spots to take great pictures, make sure to get a free map.  I would recommend this

There are so many areas of natural beauty in Ithaca, but I really enjoyed strolling through the gardens at The Plantations. I found it very inspiring and wanted to go home and start digging in my own garden. The kids really enjoyed there time there as well.

This is a MUST! Stumbled upon it on my short trip up here and have literally gone back every day.  The trick is to head over to the arboretum section, grab a map, and then head on the more remote trails that wind upriver and through amazing meadows.  I mean, the manicured gardens are fabulous as well, but the trails are some of the best I've seen!

Beautiful and underutilized. Very peaceful and majestic. Best time to come is twilight/sunset on the little patios with benches that the have on the hills.
