Upstairs from the original Molly Browns. This place is essentially a pool hall with a very very small stage at the center by the bar for one dancer, who is ALL NUDE. Tastefully done, but definitely ALL NUDE. But this place was kind of boring, actually...
Rude a holes.   The staff and dancers. Wow.  If you scrape gum off the street that is what resembles the attitudes this entire place.
This place has been around for years in Daytona Beach, FL and has always been known as a mid-range to skeevy sort of strip club. One small notch above Diamond Dolls and the Shark Lounge.
can you say ghetto, only college kids here and like damn fools.....poorly dressed people......lame dj....
cover charge, bad music, bad beer, Don't waste your $10, there is no reason to walk in to this place.
This place sucks. $10-$20 cover to see a girl dancing in a bikini. What's the point?
What is it with no topless stripping?  So lame.  It's not really a strip club if you don't strip!  Must say its a step up from Lollipops but once again not a fan.
this is not an all nude bar. sorry people. its a bikini bar. however...the bikinis are itsy bitsy. the women are pretty sweet, especially my girl S. Woman-friendly as well.
