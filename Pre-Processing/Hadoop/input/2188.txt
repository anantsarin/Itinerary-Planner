The Art Museum is great, although, I must be honest; I only visited to look at the view from the 5th floor. I was able to get a great view of Cayuga Lake and of West Campus. Unfortunately, the elevators were down the day that I went (around the end of July), which was fine for me, but folks who may not be able to walk up the stairs wouldn't have access to the great views. Also, it's a bit of a maze! Someone's review mentioned the security guards circling constantly and I found that to be true! It was a bit annoying because I felt like I was being followed! Overall, I give it 5 stars because it's free and has awesome views... My only suggestion for the museum is to be open during sunset hours!

This is an excellent art museum, especially for the price (free)! They have several floors comprising permanent and rotating exhibits. It's worth checking their web site before you go to see what's currently on display--at certain times of the year, you might find several spaces to be in transition (and therefore closed) so you might want to delay your visit until there are more exhibits open. I went in mid-June and several exhibits were closed, but I still found plenty of stuff to do and spent a couple hours inspecting the current pieces and all the helpful information they post. I really like art museums that make an effort to include information about each piece, and this museum has more than you can imagine. In addition to the thorough plaques posted next to each item, many items have supplemental information you can get by dialing a number on your phone, or scanning a QR code to visit a web site. There are also several kiosks around the museum where you can access information on complementary computers and tablets. The view from both the outdoor sculpture garden on the 2nd floor and through the windows on the 5th floor is amazing! As another reviewer mentioned, the constantly circling security staff can be sort of annoying. I was pretty much alone on one of the floors and this person kept walking past me and eyeballing me.

We stopped by the HFJ Art Museum because of extra time while visiting Cornell U. I got a brief look at the Hooper, Rembrandt and Chinese ceramic collection. The view from the 5th floor is fantastic. I can probably have spent 2 more hours in this place. If you like art you'll enjoy an amazing collection housed here. Parking lot is metered in a lot across University Ave. The Cornell Dairy Bar in Stocking Hall is now closed, for their famous ice cream you'll have to go to Trillium Express for cones, sundaes, shakes, malts and ice cream cakes!

First class museum located at the top of the hill. Stunning views of the lake from the 5th floor. An excellent cultural experience

They have some awesome exhibits from time to time and their permanent collection is pretty interesting as well, but the real reason I go here frequently is the stunning view of the lake from the 5th floor. Even if you hate museums it's worth it to come here and watch the sunset.

Fun! I love this place! You'll get some incredible views of Ithaca and the campus from the "balcony" and there's a really nice collection of art inside. Receptions are always fun to attend because they have free food and sometimes wine or beer. But beware the pretentious art students that go around being obnoxious. Most of them are there by force (for an assignment or class requirement) so rarely do they have anything insightful to say.

I am ashamed to say I never visited this museum before this past weekend.  What a waste of an amazing opportunity available to me!  I was amazed to see the collection, including works of art by Johns, Kandinsky, Warhol, Picasso, Rauschenberg, Haring, Hopper, Lichtenstein, Matisse, etc, etc, etc.  Numerous genres are represented: American, European, Pre-Columbian, Asian, African, among others.  The permanent collection includes over 30,000 works of art, and there are numerous special exhibitions annually.  There is also an outdoor sculpture garden. The view from the top floor is a work of art as well: depending on what side you are standing, you can see for miles across the hills of Ithaca, across Cayuga Lake, or the campus.  The architecture of the building itself is by the noted I.M. Pei. They are about to start building an addition, mostly underground, to expand the museum even further.  I cannot wait, I am so excited to see this gem polished even further.  I am so proud that my alma mater has such a fine museum and high regard for the arts. Now on my permanent list of things to go see every time I return, and they have a new supporter!

Really interesting museum, very nicely kept, definitely made me forget that I was still on campus. They have lots of different displays ranging from statues to pots to oil paintings. If you like museums, definitely check it out.
