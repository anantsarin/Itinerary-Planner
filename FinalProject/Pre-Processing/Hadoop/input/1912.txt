This is my second vist here, but first review.  The first time I dined here was pretty close to when they first opened and there are always little things that need to be tweaked. Food was a bit inconsistant and underseasoned, but I knew I liked it enough to give them another try. My second visit was about 10 months later and things have improved - some. The noise level was a problem before and it looks like that has been addressed by separating the bar area from dining area with glass and wood partitions which was a smart move. The food is good, but I wouldn't say outstanding.  The Arugula and Strawberry Salad was very fresh and tasty.  Just the right amount of dressing. My Croque Pepin sandwich with smoked chicken, quail eggs and black truffles was delicious, but the fries that came with it were quite soggy and limp. Good fries are hard to resist and I often find myself mindlessly eating them when they're good - these I had no problem leaving untouched. My dining companion and I ordered two desserts to share - chocolate lava cake and a banana crepe.  The lava cake was fabulous, fresh out of the over hot and gooey - just like it should be.  The crepe was too thick, rubbery and was really just rolled around a whole banana, a strange presentation which made it rather difficult to eat. Service at lunch with only a few other diners in the place was painfully slow, but friendly. So for me it's hit or miss.  I think this will be one of those places where I'll need to decide what the best things are on the menu and just stick to those favorites.
While taking a trip to Hyde Park, NY my boyfriend saw a review for this restaurant which is in a small strip mall, so I thought really?  How good is this place. I have Celiac, which I have just discovered that I have to eat gluten free which can limit some choices.  So I waited to be told the same old options that I am always offered.  Well to my disbelief the hostess explained all of the dishes that I could have, as many of these delicious entrees are made with local produce and from scratch.  As I heard my options I was ecstatic!   My meal consisted of this fantastic mozzarella dish, pork chops with collard greens and potatoes.  My boyfriend had the trout and a beet salad with three different beets, which by the way also fantastic.  There were so many options that I will stop here again when traveling in the area just to try more items on the menu. This restaurant is fantastic and I would highly recommend stopping by and having some great food!  The hostess takes her time with you and is so welcoming and nice.  It was a pleasure meeting her, she as well as this restaurant are both gems!
As we walked into Le Express Bistro for Restaurant Week, I immediately fell in love with it. The place was charming and warm. It was well decorated and the music in the background was lovely. It certainly brought up some nostalgic feeling. The offering for Hudson Valley Restaurant Week was good. We had asparagus soup with steak au poivre and duck confit. Bread pudding and crepes were excellent. We were very pleased and would return to this bistro soon. We came back to Le Express again at the end of May for lunch and were totally thrilled by the grilled octopus appetizer that sat on top of roasted beets. The octopus was amazing and the presentation of the dish was superb. I also had ramp soup which was in season and it was incredible. We are really lucky to have Le Express in our neighborhood without driving down to NYC to have the amazing meal!
Only after a serious mistake upon entering another neighbouring establishment did I saunter into a small bistro, unassuming. Asking for a drink not made prior to my visit, the owner (bartender to wit) delightedly made a test and completed sazerac cocktail to a passable standard. Peckish - but not voracious - I had the chicken liver pate, complete with red wine gelee, stone ground mustard, pickled red onions, cornichons, and toast. I asked for a bit more mustard and toast, but that is to my liking. It paired well with the sazerac! After my friends found to where I had retired, they imbibed and ate as well. Anything with arugula is a treat, sourced from Long Island. I treated myself to a combination of baklava and hazelnut biscotti gelato and paired it with a delicious limoncello. All for under $40, this little French gem is a find in the Hudson valley! If - and when - I do come back, it will be for this food!
Saw the good reviews on Yelp, and with the past week being Hudson Valley Restaurant week, had to give this place a try.  We were not disappointed. Started with an AMAZING charcuterie platter. Really, we could have left after this, it was that good.  Local cheeses from Sprout Creek as well as some great meats.  I had some escargot to start and the short rib beef bourguignon for my main.  The snails were excellent and the beef tasted like it had been slow cooked all day.  My girlfriend got the duck confit with red wine poached cherries/  The pairing of the crispy savory duck and the poached cherries was very nice (I only had a bite of that).  We both devoured the chocolate cake for dessert. Great ambiance too for being in a little strip mall.  Looks like a great place to even just grab a drink and a gourmet burger at the bar.  We'll be back.
This place is great for the neighborhood. It is located in a strip mall and the restaurant itself is roomy and inviting. We had a light dinner with some drinks. We read the reviews and was really excited about the duck confit. However, to my dismay as soon as we ordered the waitress said that they had ran out of the Hudson Valley Duck Confit Salad. I wish she should have told me that up front because I was sitting in my chair for 20 minutes thinking about it. I had to quickly choose another dish and I decided on the Vietnamese sliders, which had duck confit in it. The sliders are complemented with kim chee and an assortment of parsley and cilantro. Overall they were a little salty and dry for my taste. Pretty disappointed as most duck confit that I've ever had has been warm and juicy. We also had the escargots--baked in a garlic pesto sauce. Since this is a French/New American restaurant, we thought they would be baked in a garlic & herbed butter sauce, traditional style. The escargot were tasty, but not French in any way. The basil was a bit over powering and the bread was dense and rustic--not your usual baguette. That would've been nice! We also had rosemary and sage fries. They were a bit overcooked, not as shoe-stringy as one would expect. Actually a little soggy. Overall they were edible and warm. They hit the spot for the time being. Very nice atmosphere with somewhat attentive service. I would probably come here again if it was for lunch because I still want to try the entrees and I hear that the lunch menu is pretty reasonable. This place is more like $$$.
Delicious! We went for dinner for my daughters birthday. For appetizers ,We shared the mussels, chicken liver pate and the Vietnamese duck  confit sliders, all very good! Three of us had different steak entrees all done perfectly! My fillet Mignon was excellent!  One of us had the Croquet Monsieur, awesome.. service was great, nicely paced. I will definitely be going back real soon!
Our daughter gave us a gift certificate for Christmas because we eat out two to three times a week. We have never been here before and it was the best!  We have a new favorite place to go and bring friends. We even recommended it to my brother for his daughters graduation dinner. They have a large selection on the menu and are reasonably priced. Nice wine menu and great desserts.  Very nice platings and wonderful, friendly service. Can't wait to go back!
This was our second time at Le Express, the first was very good, very impressed and happy to have found a local good restaurant that had a thoughtful menu with quality.  This last visit was awfully disappointing.  Both steaks which we had had already were ordered medium, one came back medium rare at best and other was seared, raw & cold inside.  Probably my first sending a dish back, but we had to- was just too rare.  No apologies just a 'we'll just put it back in broiler for a few minutes'.  Fine.  Comes back and we ordered some wine which never came, finished most of steaks which had come back medium and just decided to call it a night.  Ruined the meal.   The waitress was overwhelmed even though from what I can see she only had 3 other tables.  Another waitress early on noticed we were never bought bread and did it.  In the end the waitress never came back, another came by and asked how was everything and we decided to tell her to tell waitress to cancel wine and just have waitress bring us the check.  She never did, the other waitress did.  Its bad service as it gets.  It pained me to tip her 15% but I did.  We did overhear a waitress telling another table when asked where the owner was that he had left.  It unfortunately made sense on the bad service, sadly.   In the end the food is good if you don;t have an experience like we just had.  Unfortunately the waitress has been there for quite a while because I recognized her from our last visit which was a long time ago.  So there was no excuse for the bad service, she should have learned by now and the theory of having a bad day is inexcusable, you apologize and then give extra attention for the mistakes, you don't keep making mistakes.   To the owner if he does bother to see reviews on his business: address these issues with your staff.  Have a replacement for when you're not there.  And have your chef be more careful with is work, 2 steaks that off is not a fluke and no I'm not being critical.  The steaks were extremely rare.  You have a good product here, don't ruin it like most others do or you will not last.

Le Express Bistro & Bar was a nice surprise. We went on the recommendation of Hudson Valley Mag. Food was good. Service was good. The place was nicely decorated, so it gave off a nice ambiance. We would go back again.

First: the new owners did a really nice job with the space. Lots of love and care went into redesigning the restaurant, and it shows...extra points for the demi-frosted glass on the front windows, which obscure the parking lot but still allow for a view of the trees! Second: the food. French bistro fare; now, all of sudden, Po-town goes from zero French restaurants to two. Less upscale than B292 - but still the good stuff. Croque Monsieur, monsieur? Yes please! Although the chef has a light hand with the salt (some of you will appreciate this...), everything we had was otherwise solid. Granted, I've only been for lunch - but I am looking forward to trying them out for dinner. So yeah, definitely give these guys a try. Would love to see another nice place succeed around these parts, and Le Express clearly hits that description squarely on the nose.

Glad to have this little gem nearby, Croque Monsieur is delicious, as good as any bistro in France.  Great menu, lots to choose from. Don't miss the Lava Cake it's to die for. Pleasant atmosphere, service can be a bit slow...worth the trip.

Was really looking forward to the duck confit on our visit and sadly it was not on the menu that evening, so I ordered the duck breast instead, which was quite disappointing in its taste and the polenta just wasn't a complementary side. The fresh mozzarella and heirloom tomato salad was extraordinary! The taste of real fresh home grown tomatoes with the silky, creamy mozzarella was outstanding. Others at table had peppercorn steak which was quite good. The rigatoni with shrimp was tasty as well. desserts are rather standard fare. This bistro is pricey, spotty service.

Our first visit to this establishment was Saturday night and it has moved easily to the top of our favorite local restaurant list! First impression:  the decor is country French - casual but elegant; wine list is comprehensive yet  reasonably priced. Service was excellent - attentive but not rushed. The food was amazing. I went with the specials - raw oysters and blackened fish (a sea bass relative I'm unfamiliar with). Both were among the best I've had. My wife said the same about her French onion soup and roasted chicken dish. The desserts, crepe and gelato, were excellent. My only regret was that I didn't have a chauffeur and a bigger stomach so I could have indulged more.

Went here on a Monday for the first time after reading the reviews online. First i'd like to say, that google maps, which we used for directions, doesn't know where this place is. It told me that the restaurant was about a mile and a half away from where it actually is, so if you're coming from Poughkeepsie, just keep heading straight and you'll find it. We walked in and the decor was great, very calm and nicely done. The chairs at the tables are super comfortable too. We were the only people there to eat around 8 on a Monday night, so service was very fast. We started with the estcargo, which were cooked well but could have used a bit more flavor. I had the pepercorn steak with brandy cream sauce and rosemary potatoes, which was excellent. Ordered the steak rare and it actually came rare, always a plus. Potatoes needed some more flavor but they weren't bad. I also had a bite of my companions burger, which was fucking awesome, and I will definitely be getting that as my meal when I go back! Overall this was a really nice place with good food, and i'll be back to try more of their menu.

Great food, a rare find in these parts. Although in a strip mall it's New York City quality. Hope to go back soon.
Glad to have this little gem nearby, Croque Monsieur is delicious, as good as any bistro in France.  Great menu, lots to choose from. Don't miss the Lava Cake it's to die for. Pleasant atmosphere, service can be a bit slow...worth the trip.
AWESOME little French bistro. Fantastic wine selection, I worked at a wine store for 8 years and know my wines, was very satisfied with their wine, beer, and spirit selection. Food was wonderful, I had the duck confit, the steak au povire, the smoked halibut, as well as that night's bread pudding selection, everything was fresh, and perfectly prepared. Great staff, great crowd, the bar crowd was very friendly, most people were striking up conversations with one another. Johnny runs an awesome place, would happily recommend this place to anyone.

Ate here tonight for the first time, very happy. My husbands birthday. We enjoyed everything!!! I started with the Mussels with lamb sausage & Feta -Yum!! My husband started with the octopus, he loved the dish but thought the octopi was a little over done, would definitely have both again!!!!!  The table next to us admired my mussel, after my review, they ordered two plates to share, they loved them!!! For our entrees I had the scallops....awesome, he had the hanger steak, said it was the best he ever had, so tender, perfectly cooked...we'll be back!!!!

Our second visit there and it was even better then the first.  Tried about 4 different appetizers and they were all excellent.  Octopus, Shrimp Scampi, Beet Salad...all delicious!  And our dinners were outstanding........Steak Au Poivre, Flank Steak, and a wonderful Chicken dish.   I tried a couple of wonderful Chardonnay's and my husband and our friend tried the Tempranillo and Cab Sauv and really enjoyed both.   The owners, John and Sara, are the nicest people and wonderful hosts.  We wish them much success and we will definitely be back again and again!

I would give this restaurant 3.5 stars if I could.  We made a reservation for 3 here after calling on Sunday (even though they are open, but on this website it says they aren't, however, on their main website it states that it is open on Sunday) because 2 out of the 3 people were tempted by the braised lamp shank. Upon arrival we were greater by our friendly server, Sara(h) who had thorough knowledge of he menu and informed us that the braised lamb shank wasn't on the menu tonight. We decided to stay as we liked the atmosphere (clean, low playing music in the background, quaint, and with just enough lighting to give it a nice, but not too dark of an ambiance), there was only one other party there (5:45 pm) and our waitress was friendly, knowledgable, and upbeat.   Upon deciding to stay our waitress brought us our bread promptly and took our drink orders. The bread was warm with a crisp crust and the butter had pieces of sea  salt scattered on top, which added a nice flavor. A duck breast, hangar steak, and steak au poivre were ordered, all medium rare and were cooked as ordered. The duck breast was served with mashed potatoes, and grilled brussel sprouts. The mashed potatoes were creamier than I an used to, but still good, the brussel sprouts were scrumptious, and the duck breast was moist and seasoned well. It was overall the best meal of the three. The hangar steak was served with roasted fingerling potatoes and the hangar steak was nothing out of the ordinary and was small compared to what I am used to (Terrapin in Rhinebeck had a similar price last time I went and twice the amount of meat that is just as tastey if not better). The steak au poivre was a good size and served with a brandy cream sauce and rosemary and sage fries. The steak was cooked as ordered, but nothing to wow about and that I haven't had elsewhere. The cream sauce did add a nice touch to the steak and had a good flavor to it. The fries were overly salted, so if I go there again I will order it with no salt so I can add my own at the table. We did not order dessert, so I can't comment on that, but if it was good it would've bumped up my rating to 4 stars.    Overall, this restaurant has a nice atmosphere with attentive, friendly, and knowledgable service staff, but the main course was average. I would go back to try some of the appetizers, the lamb shank when they have it, and the desserts.
Great food, a rare find in these parts. Although in a strip mall it's New York City quality. Hope to go back soon.
This is why i love YELP, for letting me find such gems like this one. I think they still have a couple growing pains but nothing at all to complain about.. The decor is so relaxing yet pretty, and has a nice touch of elegance. We were a party of 5 and the table we sat at was so spacious, and right away we felt a warm welcome.  We were in the mood for a lot of different foods, so that's what we ordered.  We paired  our wines with our brussel sprout salad (yum) duck sliders(lovely spice), and shrimp scampi(could have drank the sauce). Then for our meals we ordered a awesome bottle of a zinfandel, which my CIA bf paired wonderfully! (great wine list) my main was a sable fish with lots of local produce very well balanced dish and my fish was cooked perfectly!  Everyone basically licked their dishes clean,and we all had very different items.   So i would say my restaurant pick of the evening was a success, and I know for a fact this restaurant will do amazingly.  I hope they continue to keep items as local as possible since its in the prime place for that : )))

I only post pictures of places and food I love. But this place is something special that deserves an A+ review all around. I had the chicken and the duck as well as a creme brule. By far the beat meal i have had. Good job! Keep up the good work! A++++

Have been here twice now. Once for lunch and once for dinner. It is located inside a strip mall, they have a large bar sort of separated from the dining room. The menu is varied and specials are offered verbally. We were a party of four 2 ordered the shank special (which was dry) 2 had the scallop special which was good. It is pretty pricey here for dinner which was surprising to me. The luncheon menu prices are more reasonable. There is an abundance of desserts to choose from the gelato was the star.

So glad we came here for restaurant week! Great atmosphere. Charcuterie platter was outstanding. I had duck confit, which was crispy and delicious. We shared the chocolate lava cake -- it was gone in a flash. Absolutely wonderful from start to finish. The best meal I've had in a while.
A newcomer but already a favorite. Solid kitchen serving classic bistro dishes.
First visit under the new ownership. Big improvement. This is a great space with a friendly staff and imaginative menu. Definitely worth a try.

Fantastic food, Awesome atmosphere, Friendly owners/staff. Thank you Le Express for having such a diverse arrangement of food and wine! Food is perfect and fantastic each time!
I only post pictures of places and food I love. But this place is something special that deserves an A+ review all around. I had the chicken and the duck as well as a creme brule. By far the beat meal i have had. Good job! Keep up the good work! A++++
This was our second time there. Food and service are awesome. Would highly recommend!!!!
Have been here twice now. Once for lunch and once for dinner. It is located inside a strip mall, they have a large bar sort of separated from the dining room. The menu is varied and specials are offered verbally. We were a party of four 2 ordered the shank special (which was dry) 2 had the scallop special which was good. It is pretty pricey here for dinner which was surprising to me. The luncheon menu prices are more reasonable. There is an abundance of desserts to choose from the gelato was the star.
The pasta dish with the lamb shank and feta is a favorite. Rich flavor of the lamb and feta with homemade pasta is so wonderfully delicious . If you love lamb you must have this dish. Enjoy it with a bottle red wine many very good selections available. The glass too.
So glad we came here for restaurant week! Great atmosphere. Charcuterie platter was outstanding. I had duck confit, which was crispy and delicious. We shared the chocolate lava cake -- it was gone in a flash. Absolutely wonderful from start to finish. The best meal I've had in a while.
Was looking for someplace new and different for my husbands birthday. This place is wonderful. The staff is great, the food was wonderful. There was so much to decide one and then the specials!! Of course we ordered the special and can't wait to go back and hopefully try something off their menu because everything sound so good.

Very New York City neighborhood restaurant.   Loved the decor,  my husband and I both had the  Wild Salmon which was excellent. We even shared a desert which we never do unless we don't want the evening to end.    Good Luck John and Sara you have a winner

This place is amazing! What a find just outside of Poughkeepsie! Everything was super fresh, mostly from local farms, beautifully plated. We were there for lunch... I had a delicious butternut squash soup and a salad with local goat cheese, pumpkin seeds and a sherry vinegrette. My husband had cavetelli ( seemed homemade) with lamb ragu with fresh ricotta. Everything was amazing. The owner is very sweet and passionate about the food.

The cooking here bistro style is mostly very good, tasty and fresh. We have particularly enjoyed duck confit, short rib, lamb, steak au poivre and fish over time. We have been here multiple times. Appetizers are mostly good including onion soup. Specials can be quite interesting. However, be careful if you have a budget. When specials are described no price is given (not uncommon). But I found it surprising that one special I had was $6 above highest regular menu entree. I expect when specials with no price are given you can assume they are no higher than upper regular menu prices which is what I usually find at other places. Suggestion, give the price when listing specials, after all you don't leave them off the written menu. Big issue here is an abysmal red wine list (which is what we enjoy). Good food needs to be paired with good wine. The list is thin, but biggest problem is under $45 nothing that is worthy of the food. No reason for this, many very good restaurants in the area have wonderful selections in the $30s. Those issues aside, we still come back for the cooking.

This was not our first visit to Le Express and it surely will not be our last!  The food here is always fresh and delicious.  I had the whole-wheat spaghetti cacio pepe.  It reminded me of my Grandmother's and, yes, she was an excellent cook!  My husband thoroughly enjoyed the moules et frites.  We shared a wonderful pumpkin bread pudding with homemade vanilla gelato for dessert.  Coffee was excellent.  The bistro itself is lovely and very comfortable with soft music playing in the background--no trouble having a conversation here!  John and his staff are always welcoming and helpful in choosing a wine or a dish.  We will, of course, be back!

Out of the goodness of my heart...I'm giving them 2 stars for trying hard, After initial visit of drinks & appys, we returned for dinner on Sat. night. We knew we were in trouble when we finished cocktails, wine & bread, but still no food after 45 minutes. The comedy of errors continued when steak arrived raw w/ wrong side dish. Sent it back & 15 min. later steak came as ordered, but again wrong side. Meat was tough & lacked flavor! Oxtail w/pasta was better. (Mgr. did comp.  us on wine for wait.) The ambiance & bar are nice here, but there is a real "problem" in the kitchen if they can't keep up w/pace of house that was only 75% capacity. I'd like them to succeed, but unless they address this ASAP, it's the kiss of death.

have dined here three times and each meal has been fabulous.  On previous occasions, had the mussels and hanger steak - yum!  Last night had the best duck I've ever eaten - plus ramp soup that was absolutely scrumptious.  Run and get some before the ramps are gone!   In addition to the regular menu, there were about 6 or 7 appetizer specials and 4 or 5 special entrees.  So hard to choose!  Others  in our party had salads, hanger steak and trout - all were very happy with their meals.  The service was pleasant and well paced.  Be sure to visit Le Express - you won't be disappointed!

A long awaited elegance, style and cuisine.  Highly recommend!
Very nice place to relax at the bar or to enjoy a better than average dinner. Wine selection is very good and every time we've had dinner there we keep saying that we'll be back. The restaurant is divided from the bar area by quaint window frames hanging from the ceiling beams. Divided yet leaves the restaurant open and not closed in feeling.  About the only miss is that the bread seems to have dropped a notch recently from excellent fresh baked to a commerical product.
Great food and a nice casual ambiance! This was a great find using Yelp. The only problem was that Google Maps in my Iphone Yelp App didn't give us the right directions. Hopefully if Le Express changes their address to Wappinger Falls in the Yelp listing, out of towners will have an easier time finding it. We'll definitely be back if we're in the area!
