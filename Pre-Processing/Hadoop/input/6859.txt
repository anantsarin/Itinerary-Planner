I enjoyed my experience in Lakeland.  We went there for a girls outing.  I made a a personalized soup and crackers mug.  If you're in the Lakeland area give them a try!  The staff was friendly and there were lots of ceramics to choose from at a pretty reasonable price.  You have to wait about a week to take home your creation because it has to go through the finishing touches of glazing before it is completely ready to take home
First time here was last week, found it on a whim... What a great way to spend time with a friend, or kids, or whomever! We stayed until they closed;) Will definitely be back!!
I took my grandson and granddaughter  separately. What a great way to spend an afternoon. Their stock was a little low both times we went, but the staff is very friendly and helpful.  The special deal makes it possible for them to both do what they want.  Thanks for the deal Yelp!
I always enjoy PicassoZ Art Cafe.  This deal made is possible for me to enjoy the day with my granddaughter and her friend as well.  Keep the deals coming!
A great place to enjoy quality time with family and friends while creating some beautiful art pieces!! Great selection to choose from at great prices. Always enjoy spending time at Picassoz Art Cafe while making some life-long memories!!
We live over a hundred miles away and we still come here every time we are in Lakeland (and have our stuff mailed to us). Fun place, good atmosphere, and a fun day out.
Loved our experience!  We made two mosaic items and hope to re-visit soon
Took my kids (5 and 12) to Picassoz and had a blast. They have a lot of pieces to choose from and the atmosphere was great. Great way to spend a Saturday afternoon. Used a coupon from Yelp to help offset the price. The kids can't wait to pick up their pieces next week.
My daughter and I had so much fun. The staff is friendly and eager to help too! The yelp deal was awesome!
