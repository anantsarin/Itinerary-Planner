Eve Galleria is a one of a kind lunch place and gallery with an atmosphere like no where else. It is very cozy, and cool, with art hanging on the walls, and outside seating is also available. The food is delicious, fresh, and the employees are as nice and helpful as can be. This is not a fast food restaurant so it make take a moment or two to get your food, but it is always worth it. The owner is always there and is Â very warm and welcoming upon arrival. The gallery also holds special events weekly such as, open mic night every Wednesday and a live band plays during lunch on Thursdays. I have been to a couple of the open mic nights and the local talent is always such a pleasant surprise, and the gallery is the perfect spot to enjoy a cup of coffee and listen to music. If you are debating on coming to Eve Galleria, I highly, highly suggest it.
I have stopped here for a coffee a couple of times and for lunch a couple of times. Each time I have been here the service is extremely slow and the credit card machine is always broken. The food was very good but they never had soup when I was there even though it was written as a daily special on the black board. The atmosphere is very trendy and it is also somewhat of an art gallery with professional photos for sale. When I first walked in I thought this was the place I wanted to have lunch at on a regular basis and I thought it would be a great place for coffee and cappuccino's and my ipad... I really tried to make this place work but the service is so slow it is maddening! The killer for me was when the owner was waiting on me and I could see her thong when she bent over behind the counter. Ewww. not very hygenic.
