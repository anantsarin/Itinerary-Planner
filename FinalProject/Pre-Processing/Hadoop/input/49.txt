The Market Arcade building may be the best small public interior space in the city.  Walking into the building, you are confronted by the realization that this type of building was the forerunner to today's indoor shopping malls.  If only shopping malls could create this intimacy.   This gem was built in 1892 and it's in remarkable condition with a bold purple, green, red and grey interior color scheme that pops under the glass pane roof which floods the interior with light.  There are private offices here, a sandwich shop, an art gallery and a tourist visitor's center that is well-stocked with everything Buffalo and western New York.  Don't forget to check out the exterior details, too, especially the large Buffalo head over each entrance.  Anyone who visits Buffalo should stop here first to stock up on information and nostalgia.
Cool European style indoor shopping and art center. After lacking in retail for many years, it is finally coming back with several new boutique shops on the first level and more expected soon. A must see for free art, the visitor center/gift shop and cool shopping.
