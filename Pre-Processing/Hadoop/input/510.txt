Mannequins always look good, but most of the stuff in the store is disappointing. Clothes are more geared toward the 16-20 age group who likes bright colors and  short length-ed dresses. The jewelry is very cheap looking. The price point is pretty reasonable, from around $35-60. I've gone in there a few times and only bought one piece so far Overall: A nice place to stop buy if you have time to kill or are in no rush, but it's just not my style I guess.
Ewwww gross! Trashy! Trashy! Trashy! If you want fluorescent skanky clothes, Cheap quality, Earring that say "B*tch" in big shiny letters for the whole world to see how you see yourself as a low class, low self-esteem, ignorant young female, then this store is the place for you. If you have any sense of style, self-respect or dignity, shop elsewhere!
I always am lured in hopeful  but leave disappointed. However I am  above and beyond the 16-21 year old age range this store would probably be prefect for.
