Life was slapping me around sometime ago. I had to take a break and return to my hometown Rochester, NY for a while. Out of all the things I'd plan to pack?, I knew I had to bring my boxing gloves. Shortly after arriving to Rochester I started looking for gyms, I choose ROC Boxing and Fitness because of the reasonable rates and informative web site. After inspecting the gym and seeing a part of a class I signed up for a month and begun taking the beginner boxing/workout classes. What a good time! The instructors were great! Bootcamp style workouts while learning boxing techniques. Every class they made sure you get a little heavy bag work in. Pools of sweat. Really awesome atmosphere to train in, encouraging staff and all around professional experience. The Gym - 2 levels, the most kettle bells I've seen in a boxing gym. 2 rings, ample heavy bags (some classes got crowded and people shared heavy bags with one another. Small but useful free weight section and treadmills Almost makes me want to move back to Rochester! I said almost.
