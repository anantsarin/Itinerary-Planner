DRIP is a uniquely "outside the box" artistic sampling for the senses. It's is an alternative to your typical night out. I highly recommend putting this place on your to-do list if you have an appreciation for all things non commercial. It has that unpolished feel to it. What to know:   1) There's a high probability that you will get wet/painted on so dress down as the website says. 2) If you are planning on going, go all in. I felt that committing to getting wet only enhanced our groups experience so just go for it. 3) The show starts slightly after 9 pm and lasts just short of an hour. It goes by quick, so that must mean it was really good. The doors open at 8pm so you can pregame with a few drinks before the show starts and take advantage of the painting station. It makes for great pictures to capture the memories. 4) The bar has a  very warehouse feel to it, so if you're expecting some polished production like Cirque De Soleil..don't. It's a very gritty performance which only adds to the atmosphere. 5) The staff and dancers are very welcoming and friendly. I suggest you mingle and talk to them. Support your local artists. I would recommend this adventure to everyone.
Drip is one of the few things along I-Drive that is actually worth being on I-Drive for. Some people ding it for the location, and granted, getting there is a real pain because of the traffic.  But don't hate the location too much, because if it was downtown or somewhere else more accessible to locals, you'd have to get your tickets months in advance. The website states that the show starts "a little after 9pm".  Don't expect it to start at exactly 9pm, because it just doesn't.  If you're the type that can't stand things running late, I'd suggest planning a 30-45 minute buffer into your evening. Everyone else has already said so much about the show that I can safely assume you've already got the gist of it.  Well maybe most people; apparently one thing does need to be repeated (I'm looking at you, "One Star Because I 'Just Spent a Ton of Money on My Hair and Now It's Messy'"), so straight from the Drip website: - There are no splash zones because the entire building is considered a splash zone. - Dress Down (jeans, t-shirt and flip-flops/sneakers are great) and assume you will get wet and painty. I recommend hitting the paint bar to get yourselves messy before the show even starts.  It puts you in "mess mode" and it's fun to fling paint on your friends. You can grab a plastic bag or two to keep your belongings dry (highly recommended), and they have CSI-like booties if you don't want to mess up your shoes (better idea: just wear ratty shoes!). The drinks could be better (or at least cheaper), $7 for a rum & coke in a tiny plastic cup is just too much. But that's really the only complaint I can come up with.  The show itself is amazing, and after having seen it twice, I'd have no problem going to see it a third time.  It's unique, beautiful, and so entertaining that the 50-minute show feels like 15 minutes.
I don't think Drip is located in the best area of Orlando.  I think it would do far better closer to where locals hang out rather than tourists.  As a local, I avoid I-Drive at all costs.   I also think it's overpriced.  The show is nice and all, but you pay extra for drinks and it's less than an hour of entertainment. That being said, I think it's a cool idea.  The intimate setting combined with live rock music and messy things spilling on you is novel and fun.  The colors really do wash out, you guys.
DRIP is one of the best things about Orlando. I don't even care that it's on I-Drive and I HATE I-Drive. I took a group of lady friends to see a show one weeknight and we were not disappointed. A few things: ** Wear a white t-shirt (with something underneath) to get the full experience. ** You're going to get wet, painted, and perhaps a little sandy. It's part of the fun! ** For $8, you get 4 colored domestic beers (colors match the colors in the show)  or wines (not colored, so not as fun). ** The people serving you in the beginning near the bar area? Yeah, they'll probably be a part of the show. Things escalate pretty quickly once the show begins - and it begins outside of the "theater". ** The colors all mean something and the actors really play their "colors" well. ** It's noisy and it's got a love story theme. I like that the show gives you a little bit of room for your own imagination, but that's not for everyone. ** Hang around after the show to mingle with the actors and get their take on the performance. DRIP is a bit pricy, but if you buy the tickets online there's usually a discount code available. It's best to buy them online anyways, as they only allow a certain number of people in per show. Most of us didn't opt in for the "souvenir" t-shirt and we were okay with that - white shirts were way more fun. Also, not sure if this is a regular occurrence, but an oxygen bar was available on the night we went. If you're into that sort of thing, have at it! So, in summation: CHECK THIS SHIT OUT!
If you like dance and rock and roll and aren't afraid to get messy, this is the show for you!  Set in a grungy, industrial bar; DRIP is a passionate performance of music, movement, and color.  I went here for my birthday not knowing what to expect and was floored.  When you walk in, there is a paint station against the back wall where you can paint yourself, your friends, or an official DRIP shirt.  The show starts when the clear, plastic panels are raised; and then, the real fun begins!  I can't wait to go back! A few words to the wise... - If you want to park for free, get there early.  Otherwise, it's $5 (which isn't that bad). - Bring only the necessities.  What ever you bring will get paint on it.  The paint appears to be water-based.  I had no trouble getting it off my bag or glasses, but still. - Dress down.  Again, no matter how hard you try, you will get paint on yourself. - Wear flip flops or shoes that can be easily washed.  Also, there are no seats in the performance space, so make sure you are comfortable.
This was a very cool experience, and being originally from an area with a vibrant and eclectic art scene, I was happy to find something like this in Orlando.  The band was really great and the performers not only were tending before/ after the show, but were easily approachable and very interesting to talk to.   The show in itself was very interesting and I noticed a cool "duality" theme of the main character being pulled towards "evil" by the few other entertainers.  Or that's what I saw.  I was kind of drunk so I may be wrong in my interpretation.  Plus, I don't like to be one of those people that I like to refer to as "pretentious art fucks" that seem to always have a profound sounding, but utterly bullshit interpretation of a piece of art.  If the painting walks like a dick, talks like a dick, and quacks like a dick...I'm going to assume the artist intended to just paint a massive dick. I thought that the performers moving throughout the audience was really cool, and not like in "Cats" where you slowly reach for your pepper spray and/or pulse rifle.  The dance routines were very well choreographed and I think that there was a good amount of improvisation in the performance.  The location was pretty cool and had a semi- real "industrial" feel to it.  Some have described it as a "dive bar", but that term to me was ruined when hipsters started to make a bar seem like a dive through design, instead of letting it happening naturally...with the frequenting of drug abusing fishermen, the occasional low-end prostitute, and the necessary Vietnam vet in a wheelchair or missing some appendage.  Ah, I miss my old local....good times, and a plethora of various opiates to buy. I would very much recommend this to someone as a one-time experience, but I can see the novelty wearing off. As for the people at the show, there seemed to be a good mix, but I can also see nights where you will be surrounded by people who wish they lived in some "cooler" city with better indy bands.  I ran into a few, and yes...I hate hipsters.
What an interesting experience.  I probably would never have thought of going to this show, but there was an Orlando Weekly deal for half off, which I couldn't pass up. When you first get there you are put into a room with a bar where you can order colored beer among many other things, and a table at the end of the room with different colored paints and brushes.  You are encouraged to get messy the second you get there.  My friends and I decided that was a great idea and headed straight to the paint table.  We splattered each other with paint everywhere and had an absolutely great time doing it!  That was actually our favorite part of the entire evening. As we were hanging out near the bar, loud music started to play, the plastic walls leading to the other room were taken down, and people started dancing around on the bar top and around the room and pouring colored beer down people's mouths.  The show then gravitated to the other room where more dancing took place, plenty of colored water was thrown around, sand, and paint.  The story line was basically a woman and a man fighting over the same woman who they both had a love interest in.  It was very entertaining and interesting.  The show ended with a water balloon fight that required audience participation.  It was great. The paint comes off of your body and out of your hair easily.  Wear clothes you might not want anymore and bring a towel for your car in case any of you is still wet when you leave.
I do NOT know what people see in this. I don't like to give bad reviews or seem like a cretin, and this was also a gift. There was also one not-lame part so I'll get to that at the end. My interpretation of the evening: 1) Come in. Sign waiver. Pay extra money for dyed beer if you want, get some mandatory paint on you somewhere.Pay extra money for clothes if you want to get sanded/painted. 2) Stand with a bunch of people. There is no talking once the 'show starts'. A little awkward. If you're like me, stand as far away as possible so you don't get paint, sand, or water on you. 3) Story is somewhat followable (Spoiler alert I think): Party girls are dancing provocatively at the club. Man and woman fall in love, experience love through paint and water and sand. Guy cheats on woman. (Actor seems gay, ignore this.) We watch the cheating. We watch the woman upset. We watch her regain not being upset and her true identity (symbolized by the color yellow.) The best part of this show was the strobe light effects at the end. Otherwise I felt it was trying too hard to create an EXPERIENCE. But maybe I'm just not hip...maybe if you're a partier/clubber you will like this more. Or maybe I should have come more intoxicated.
DIG IT! Their website and twitter are ilovedrip.com @ILoveDrip and I do, I love Drip!!   Where to start? I have seen drip perform in the past at other Orlando events and as part of creative events around town but with their new home on I-Drive, it's a whole different experience. Will you get wet? YES! Will you have a blast? YES! Will you want to dance and party throughout the night after experiencing this? YES Have you ever witnessed art like this before? No! Do you want to miss this show? NO! Go, Now! You definitely see art come alive during this show. It is set in an industrial warehouse set off of I-Drive, it's right near Howl at the Moon. When you arrive, you don't really know what to expect as it's very low key. You roll up to the bar and enjoy beer or wine. There is colored beer that goes along with the theme of the show, and you can choose from orange, yellow, red or blue! This all ties into the story behind the show as well. Make sure you are choosing the right side =) While you are enjoying drinks at the bar with your friends, some interesting peeps start mixing and mingling along the bar and then BAM! Show starts how you least expect it. I won't give too much away so you are surprised but if you are sitting at the bar, you will get drenched. No worries though, all the colors come out of your clothes when you wash but if you do plan on going somewhere after, wear a poncho or bring a change of clothes. But if you wear white, it kinda makes your clothes look THAT much more awesome. When the show starts, it moved you from the bar area to a side area where the live band is set. The fixtures are all moveable as this show is extremely interactive and all the players involved have various roles. I was not expecting there to be such a deep story with the show but it really added to the experience more. You found yourself surprised and actually feeling for each character. I was blown away by the props and usage of the entire space. After the show you get to chat with the dancers/actors and you really can tell they just adore being part of this experience. This is something everyone can tell you about but something you have to experience for yourself to get the true overall feeling. It's a great deal to, only $29-$35 so don't wait to hear all the talk about it, go experience it for yourself. Thur/Fri/Sat at 8pm. Support your local arts and culture community.
A couple of my friends had told me about Drip, saying how awesome and amazing it was. I ended up bringing my boyfriend to the show for his birthday. When I went to the front to pick up my tickets that I had bought online, turns out that that night's show was totally free because it was their 6 month anniversary! The said I could use the tix that I purchased for another night. Way cool start to the evening! The show was such an amazing experience. It all begins in the room next to the actual show "theater." There are a couple stations around the room: There is a painting area where you can paint yourself or your friends with water soluble paint. Another station is the cutting/design t-shirt station. There is a person who is talented in cutting up your white t-shirt into cool hip designs for you to wear. There is an oxygen bar station which I didn't check out. Then the best station...the beer and wine bar! All the beer is colored which is fun and goes along with the theme. They also serve wine, that is not colored, but fun also because it obviously has higher alcohol content haha. The show was awesome- there is a live rock band that play synchronized to the dancers. The dancing tells a love story. The dancers/actresses are so good at acting their emotions where I felt my throat tighten up (that feeling that you are able to cry)! You will get wet with water, paint or beer. I was a mess after the show with the blue colored water all over my face and legs. Thank goodness that it all washed off easily in the shower! I had so much fun. I can't wait to go again!
This past weekend we caught the show DRIP over on I-Drive. After DRIP contacted me to see if I would be interested in seeing the show, I checked out their webpage and it looked pretty fun! I would describe DRIP as an intense artsy/dance show that is crazy messy- so don't wear anything too nice! The location is on I-Drive (which I am not a fan of), but is fairly close to the intersection of Sand Lake Road. The location is behind the Denny's & Senor Frogs. We were able to find a free parking spot no problem. The doors open at 7:30 and the 45 minute show started a littler after 8. Oh, and you have to be 21+ and sign a waiver that you are ok with it getting a little crazy, so adults only! Tickets are between $25-$30, which is about right for something on I-Drive. The bar was stocked with beer and wine for pretty decent prices. They also have colored beer, if that's your thing, but I didn't really care for it. The drink selections are all listed on the wall behind the bar. I went with a Stella & the bf had a glass of wine (you think it would be opposite, right?!) Once the show started, everyone was guided into a large warehouse type room, standing room only. Basically, the place was full of people lined up on 3 walls to watch the show. The band was on a stage and the music was pretty intense and heavy, but not too loud that you couldn't talk to the person next to you. ***Update: Everyone seems to have had a much louder experience then me. I was probably the furthest away from the stage and perhaps b/c I went on opening weekend, they were still working out some kinks with the sound. It was definitely not deafening and my ears weren't ringing. Based on other reviews, the music is now cranked up to an 11. The show involved lots of intense dancing, swinging from ropes, dancing on stage, etc. Oh- and there is some strobe light action! On the floor, in the middle was sand- a ton of sand. The ceiling had sprinklers, paint cans, and jeans (?!) that we discovered held even more sand. Because of the set-up, everyone in the audience was only a handful of feet away from the performers. As the show went on, it got messier and messier. All the performers were covered in a ton of colored paint & water. People in the crowd definitely got wet (I hid shrieking behind the bf) or had sand, water or champagne tossed on them. Also, be careful if you lean against any walls ;) Once the show was over, the crowd could venture back over to the bar area, grab a seat and meet and greet with the performers! This is definitely one of the more unique shows I have ever been to, especially in Orlando. It has the same elements as Blue Man Group and a little bit of Cirque de Soleil, but this has a much more indy type vibe.
Beyond phenomenal, DRIP is an experience that will engage your emotions, senses, and your sense of fun. Previous reviewers Colleen and Kristin sum up the experience fairly well, so I will just add in a few notes from my recent visit, where I took my 75-year old parents (!!) and two 70-year old aunts (!!) - ALL of whom loved it! - Customer Service.  I had a Living Social deal but needed one more ticket.  The lovely Melissa made my customer service experience so easy, pleasant, fun.  Bless her heart.  And when we arrived, she helped to make sure that we had seats for my elderly family member who could not stand for the whole 1 hour show.  What a sweetheart.  Everyone, frankly, was so happy and kind - they must love working there....! - Earplugs.  The music is not, as Kristin wrote "loud but not too loud to talk over".  It is deafening (as I write this the next morning, my ears are still ringing.  It was painfully loud before the band came on and then literally rock-concert levels when the band played.  They sell earplugs for $1 or BYO.  The music was great, though; sounded like the band was playing their own compositions, and relentlessly without pause, which was impressive. - Bathrooms.  There is one ladies with many stalls and a fellas.  They are both in the entry hallway (the mens is very close to the first entry door and the ladies a bit further on.).  Go potty BEFORE the show starts! Once the show is on, the hallway to the loo is pitch black and you will have a tough time getting there in the dark. - Parking.  There is somewhat of not enough spots so plan on getting there early (doors open 7:30) to get a free spot or you may have to pay for parking or use the free valet at Señor Frogs (but then tip the poor nice valet guys!). - Drinks. The way they are working it nowadays (And I believe it's going to change as there was a big note "Full bar coming soon") is that one buys a $6 cup from a "cup girl".  Then you get a cup full of colored beer or soda pop or wine (not sure if they put colors in those or...not?!), up to 3 cups per person (marked on your hand by another lass).  Not sure how this system works, but I think it seems pretty fair, all in all.  There was Red Bull for sale apart, as well. A big big note: YOU WILL GET PAINT-Y.  This is not like some shows where there is a safe "spash zone" and the rest of the crowd will stay dry.  The audience is handed paint-water balloons at a certain point, and who knows if your fellow audience member has the great aim of the troop of DRIP (who generally makes it clear where the next wet is going to be).  Another note: it ALL came off my clothes, but getting it off my purse was a pain.  So I suggest you just bring yourself and tuck your money in your pocket.  Put your cellphone (if you must have it) in a Ziploc! But whatever you *do* do, don't miss DRIP.  I have seen live shows all over the world but never, every, anything like this joy.  Can't wait to go back.....!
My friend and I happen to stumble on this place when we were walking to our car in the parking lot and we started talking to two staff members (Dakota and Tinker Bell) who were just outside the entrance.  They were vey nice and explained what the show was about and on a whim we decided to see the next show which happen to be starting 20mins.  It was the best decision we made that night.   You can overlook it easily because its in the back of a building and not facing International Drive.  Being a local this was great and refreshing experience with a great show.  Staff was very friendly as well.  I'll be recommending this show to my friends (and i'll be going again) who visit Orlando who want to have some drinks and see a completely original show.  They have a live band that plays during the entire show and the band itself is very good and compliments the show wonderfully. It's very nice to have something on International Drive besides another lame piano bar, mexican restaurant with cheesy choreographed dancing and bad food (Senor Frogs) which is right in front of this place, or a kids magic show.   A few tips: -Put your phone in a plastic bag because you will get wet (not completely drenched but yes wet enough to damage electronics)  They have plastic bags at the entrance when you pay. -It's a pretty interactive show and you stand the entire time (about 1 hour)  that so keep that in mind.  I sat down and enjoyed a drink before the show started so I was fine. -Ask the staff what the storyline of the show is so you will understand it better when you watch it and enjoy it more.  (although its not hard to understand)  The show I watched was a love story. -Once again you will get wet so maybe bring an extra shirt in your car (if you don't buy one of their shirts)   Now that you know this you can relax and and enjoy the show!!
Interesting place. Not for everyone probably. It is basically forced audience participation. At one point I couldn't tell if I was having fun or terrified. When you get there, you sign a waiver just in case you get sand in your eye or the color doesn't come out of your clothes. BTW, wear something you don't mind ruining (though everything came out of mine fine but just in case). Then you head to the bar area. They had beer and wine. I opted for the colored beer special. There were four colors but I went for purple (a mix of red and blue). Then the show starts - the dancers come into the bar area and start dancing. And throwing champagne and beer on you. Once you get dowsed with colored beer, you pretty much are committed to the rest of the show. Then they move into room two which is the show room. They dance in sand and in water then mud. It is really creative. They throw water balloons on the walls above your head. The show is a little sad. It is about two people falling in love and then out of love. Afterwards, you can take pictures with the performers. And it was my birthday so they hooked me up with free beer. :) It is a unique place. A lot different than the average I Drive experience. Worth going to check out, unless you don't like getting dirty and sandy.
What an amazing time we had!  Drip is a total in your face experience.  You will get soaked, you will get smashed with a water balloon, and you will get painted on.   This is the one place where you can dress down, and just let loose.   The staff here are extremely welcoming, they do it all, from serving the beer, making you a custom t-shirt, and the majority of them were the actual dancers. The tickets can get be a little pricey, but it's worth it.   Once you have all your instructions and sign the waiver you enter into a world of fun.  Chalkboard walls, white t-shirts to purchase and cut up, paint on, whatever floats your boat.  You buy a cup for $8 and you are allowed 4 drinks, I think they lost count after my 2.  They serve colorful beer, wine, and soda.   There is live music playing through the entire act, which played out as a love story.  One I'm sure we can all relate too.   ****Do not bring anything you do not want to get wet*****     All of the paint washed off, and came out of my clothes so no worries.
Unique, Original, One-of-a Kind show!  Located behind Senor Frogs in an industrial bar.  Be prepared to get paint hrown at you in every direction! Cool show with rock and roll about 3 people, each representing a different color and a story line based on each color.... Had a great time, definitely recommended. As an added bonus, try the oxygen bar!
*When they say you're going to get wet.... you're definitely going to get wet.* This place is right behind Denny's.  It'd probably be best to pay for parking unless you want the thrill of possibly having your car towed. You can come in an hour prior to show time.  I brought my own ear plugs because I don't like terribly loud noises but if you forget to bring them, it's $1 a pair. So you go inside, mingle around, get a t-shirt if you so desire.  Staff is available to cut it and do all sorts of neat stuff to it.  Then there's the bar with the 4 colored beers, wine and when I went, they had pizza.  An oxygen bar is also available.  The paint station, have fun go crazy, it's washable paint! So after you do all that, mingle around, drink, and wait.  Although show time was at 9 pm, it didn't start till quite a bit afterwards.   Apparently, the cast had consisted of male and females but my show was all females.  For some individuals, they may not enjoy that aspect.  For some... it may be even more appealing.  The male dancer had left, so they just changed it to an all female cast for now.   The beginning started abruptly, but entertaining.  I really enjoyed the music a lot but I was definitely glad I brought the ear plugs.  So the show starts out in the bar area and goes in the theater area.  The show got progressively better for me as it went along.  Nice choreography, good story-line. Okay, so I knew I was going to get wet.... but I didn't realize how wet and sandy I would have gotten.  There were some scenes where both my friend and I were looking around bewildered.  "WTH is that water coming from?!"  If you want the full experience, stand in the middle area. I HIGHLY suggest bring a change of clothes.  My friend and I ended up stanky from all the colored beer, water, sand and paint. All in all, I did have fun.  Fantastic music, good show, nice effects.  Definitely a one-of-kind experience.   - Check out their website because they have different nights, like Gay Days for men, Gay Days for women, local art.
Amazing, Sexy and Fun! This place better survive... this is *exactly* the type of thing Orlando needs to make it more of a "big city".  Off-Broadway caliber show that excites you and draws you in.   Everything has already been said in the other reviews...but to review the basics. - You will get wet! - You will get dirty/painted! - You will see things that are PG-13 in nature! - You may possibly see two women kiss! - Parking sucks... pay the $5 to park in the hotel lot! - Bring a zip lock baggie for your phone! - Buy some colored beer.. its fun! - Get there a little early to paint on each other and have a drink! - Earplugs are available for $1.  It is loud...so buy em or bring em. Only annoying thing was the show starting 30 minutes after the posted start time.  15 minutes for latecomers is fine.. 30 minutes has me checking my watch to see whats wrong. This *easily* worth the full price ticket price.  DO IT!
Something so different. Beautiful choreography done by amazing dancers. It was awesome with so many things going on around you. My husband and I really tried not to get paint on us but it was impossible... We were soaked, but still well worth it. Recommend it once to anyone that's adventurous.
Drip is such a fun outing! Located on International Drive (behind Senor Frog's), this little dive bar comes to life.  Everyone was incredibly warm and friendly, which set the tone for a beautiful, intimate show.  They have a free paint station and white Drip t-shirts for sale to decorate yourself and your companions. They have colored beer and other drinks for sale that were very reasonably priced.  It is a very laid-back place, where you can draw on the walls and enjoy a good laugh with great people. I would definitely recommend Drip to anyone who enjoys wonderful live music and story through dance. It is standing room only and be prepared to leave very messy.
A great alternative to the touristy attractions for Orlando residents. Definitely wear clothes you don't mind ruining. Unlike these other reviewers, the paint unfortunately did come out of my clothes. It may seem a little wired and confusing at first, but hang in there. When you start realizing there is a story being told and not just random dancing and paint, it's a lot more enjoyable.
Let me start with the worst of it- our hair is ruined because of this ridiculous show. We managed to avoid the exorbitant  intentional attempts by the dancers and crew to splash us with their watered down paint and colored beer until the last moment of the show when we were drenched from behind with pitchers of red beer that stained our blonde hair. I recently spent a ton of money getting my hair done, and while you are warned you will be splashed, we certainly didn't realize we were going to be drenched with something that would literally ruin our hair. The show itself is mediocre if you have ever seen real live performance art shows in better venues. I've seen this described as 'industrial', however I disagree, industrial can still be chic and not just cheap looking. There are only 3 dancers and a band, not at all what we expected. The show started 20 min late and the person at the door didn't mention that to us when we came in thinking we were running late. No one ever checked our tickets (after spending 15 min online to go thru the ordeal of signing up for a Tix acct just to print them out) so we had no clue what was going on when we walked in. We couldn't get a drink until the show was over and the liquor was literally watered down in the bottle. The bartender said 'I hope you like strong drinks' and poured the alcohol more than 3/4 of the way up the glass with a hardly more than a splash of flat coke and yet we couldn't even taste the alcohol. All the way across the board we found the show boring, the concept was interesting but poorly executed, the lighting was awful and visually it fell flat and well as an unorganized and pretentious vibe from the crew/performers. Standing thru the entire show only served the purpose of the staff trying to get you wet and covered in sand and made for a cramped and certainly not comfortable setting. Don't plan on going out afterwards or seeing this show on date night. It's not like you will leave with a cool, covered in paint look; instead you will look like you have some sort of weird skin condition and an awful dye job from the food colored beer and watered down paint. I do not recommend this show at all.
Ill just get to the point. I respect how hard the dancers worked and I wish they would do something else. The show seemed to come out of a  perverted guy that wanted to make a few bucks from his friends. The video online is awesome, the show on the other hand is raunchy. I took my girlfriend and we were expecting to get paint on us and some colored beer during a good show but everybody seemed drunk and they were just egging the girls on to kiss. So it's really a strip joint, but without stripping. Smelt terrible....we didn't stay until the end. Would love joy money back, but that won't happen.
