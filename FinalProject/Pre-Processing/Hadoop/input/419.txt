Just got my hair done there after reading the other reviews. Carmen and Ivy are so sweet. I was pressed for time and they were both standing over me doing my hair to accommodate me before my work shift starts. Â Amazing people, great results. Ivy is very knowledge about her work and offers great recommendations for skincare and haircare. If you want a personable salon where visiting seems like visiting an old friend, I highly recommend this salon.
I've been going to this salon for about 6 years. The best services I have ever gotten and at the cheapest I can get around. You will never go wrong with touch of class. Hair,nails, facials,massages.. you name it. I'm a faithful costumer to this parlor. They worry about my hair and skin more than myself and they are always friendly.
All I would say is...DELIGHTFUL! The employees there are so warm and loving. And heck yes, they know what they are doing!
