I belonged to this health club for one year while I lived in downtown Syracuse. Overall I was content with the gym. I mainly used this location since it was only a block away from my apartment.  This location does not have many of the other classes and some extra equipment that their Fairmont location has. The staff were always friendly. The place was moderately clean. I did not like the exercise mats, they were like dirty styrofoam. Since I do not like doing classes the gym's lack of classes was not a problem for me. They only offer occasional spin classes here. The other locations offer a wide range of classes. They have personal trainers and I think an option for group personal trainings.  Their choice in music to play was odd at times. Sometimes it was upbeat music you would typically hear at a gym, but sometimes it was slow country music, not what I would want to hear when trying to get motivated to exercise more. The locker room was okay, it was clean, had showers, toilets and many lockers.
Nice gym and convenient. But, they allow members to drop the weights; it's so distracting and the employees say nothing to the members.
