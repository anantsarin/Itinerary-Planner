Great place for getting a coffee drink or, more important, a craft beer in the back Tavern. This location has quite a different clientele from the Triphammer location owing to its location near the commons, but it is enjoyable all the same. I can't say much about the coffee and food because I normally visit just the tavern, but everything seems well-priced. The beer selection on tap is usually different from Triphammer so you will get a good variety if you visit both places. The other major difference is that this location has home brewing supplies such as equipment, yeast, and hops. So if you are into that, you probably know about this place already.

To be honest, this place is just OK. The coffee itself is decent, but not amazing.  I may not exactly be enough of a coffee nerd to see the major difference between this and the many other coffee joints in Ithaca, but for what it's worth, this just isn't stand-out.  It's just decent. Hate to be a downer, but in a town with a bazillion coffee joints, it's hard to rock the boat.

Whoever said "the whole is more than the sum of its parts" hasn't been to Ithaca Coffee Company. I wouldn't call it either the best cafe in Ithaca or its best beer store, but it's a pretty great combination of those things, plus sells some hard-to-find (in downtown Ithaca) gourmet foods on top of that. I'm a massive fan of the coffee, which is underrated in a town dominated by Gimme and made just as crazy caffeinated as anything at CTB - although I sometimes wish the seating area in their cafe section were more extensive. And while I wouldn't hang out for an extended period of time in the tavern area - why, when there are "real" bars around? - the beer selection is definitely the best downtown as well. The place is not without some hiccups - the regular crowd in the tavern area can be annoying if you're trying to work in the cafe, the espresso machine has broken down for the day, rendering a coffee run pointless, and I've had to prompt a server for a forgotten sandwich order once or twice - but if anything, my main complaint is that I wish there were some way they could expand in the same or a nearer location and offer more cafe seating, more gourmet groceries, and more beers.
Good coffee up front, especially the iced coffee (the cubes are made of frozen coffee!) and really great beer tastings on Thursdays in the rear tap room.  The coffee shop is small -- not much seating -- but there is the taproom out back where coffee drinkers can also hang out before the bar opens. Only 4 stars because the tap room is also a beer making supply store where the occasional customer buying grains has to run a mill that makes tons of noise, making it impossible to talk or think.

So I'm always looking for some good coffee so I thought I'd try this place out, and to my surprise not only do I find great coffee but I also find AMAZING Beer!!! One of the things that was so rad about their selection was that they carried a good number of Colorado beers, which is where the best beer in the world comes from! The people who work here are very nice and knowledgable about both coffee and beer which was pretty awesome! I also found out they roast their beans there in town which is pretty awesome! Oh yeah, did I mention, they also sell supplies to brew your own beer!!! From the brewing equipment to special hops!!! This place really has it all!!! Ok so I might have dropped it half a star for location and ambiance, since the parking situations not that great and the place seems kinda cluttered inside, but otherwise this place rocks!!! I can't wait to go back!!!
Here's why I'm a fan: short line great service tasty breakfast foods reasonable prices strong coffee lots of extras in the shop If you're in Ithaca, stop in!

Get your buzz on here any way you like! Fresh roasted beans and brewed coffee are in front; taps, craft beer sixes and home-brew supplies are in back. The coffee is roasted in Ithaca at their main location in the triphammer Mall, so it's ultra fresh. Friendly baristas and a modest selection of baked goods make this a good breakfast spot. I admired the Japanese-style slow brewer, 24 hours to drip a gallon or so of water thru the beans (see pic), very cool!  Also quite a few beers on tap at the bar in back for happy hour. It seems just a little too easy to spend a lot of time and money here :-)

Excellent coffee and breakfast sandwiches. Service was perfect and atmosphere was great.

As I mentioned in my tip for this place, the beer selection is AWESOME.  I'm basically going to live here once I move to Ithaca (I have been told that there are tastings on Thursdays, and I definitely plan to be at those).   But I must say that the tea selections are not as impressive.  When I was here a few years ago, they had a really great selection of loose leaf teas in buckets that you could measure out for yourself.  I liked that.  Now they seem to only have pre-packaged loose leaf teas.  I'm sure there are still some good ones, but it's not a change that I'm very enthusiastic about.  And I was really disappointed that they use that boxed chai tea that you can buy at Walmart.  For a place that is supposed to have interesting coffees and (secondarily) teas, they're not aiming too high with the chai they serve you there.

There are so many reasons to visit Ithaca Coffee Company: -smooth dreamy coffee -broad selection of local products, including craft beers and gourmet food -very, very friendly staff -space to chill with your laptop or a newspaper (note: I'm not sure if they offer wi-fi) -a mug club -a small cafe with sandwiches, breakfast, and baked goods -works of local artists on the walls -convenient location near Ithaca Commons with free parking right outside the door Whatever your reasons (mostly, mine are the convenient location, the coffee, and the friendly staff), you won't be disappointed with your visit to Ithaca Coffee Company.

This is a great place to come in a grab a beer.  Being a kind of low key guy, this was one of my favorite places in Ithaca.  They have a huge selection of domestic and import beers that is wide ranging from Anchor Steam to Shipyard.  That pretty much spans the entire US.  Imports were solid as well.  They also have a decent selection on tap that you can fill with a growler or you can grab a bottled beer and have them chill it and drink it there.  It's a nice spot to hang out and have a beer with a buddy.  They also have beer making supplies and free popcorn.  Oh yeah, coffee in the front portion as well.

This is one of my favourite places to get coffee beans from. They have an excellent selection of different beans. My view is that locally roasted coffee is the way forward for coffee shops, in much the same way that locally brewed craft beer is the way forward for pubs. One of the great things about this store, is that it doesn't just sell coffee. They also have a range of European cheeses and chocolates, and a fantastic selection of different beers. I particularly like the fact that they sell Hobgoblin dark ale. It's brewed in a small brewery in Oxfordshire, England, near where I grew up, so it reminds me of home.

Wandering around downtown last week, I stopped by for a six pack of my favorite Hefe-Weizen. I went into the bar/tastting area and took a seat at the far end. The 'bartender'" was chatting with a group of youngish women. i waited patiently for about a minute, then  asked what was on tap? He just pointed to the chalkboard, and went back to his group. I picked out a regional beer and asked for a pint.  He sighed and went and filled my order, took my money and then THREW MY CHANGE AT ME. All this without speaking a word. Seriously, fuck you dude and your fucking condescending attitude.  Lots of beer stores in the city without having to visit this snob-o-teria.

I like this local coffee shop! It has local coffee, local beer and local people. And they have MORE than just coffee. They have wine and beer. They have a good selection of beer in the back. We only purchased drinks though- a mocha blended coffee, iced coffee and a mango smoothie. The best was the mango smoothie surprisingly. The mocha blended drink was a little on the strong side, like it had espresso instead of coffee in it. The iced coffee was ok, I have had better but I liked it. We stopped by twice which visiting Ithaca.
