Had a manicure with Nancy! Fabulous! Love the decor here and can't wait to come back for a pedi (was in a hurry otherwise would have had it) - the pedi chairs look so comfy. They have little treats while you wait (didn't have to wait at all). My mani looks just like the one I had at the Ritz Spa in south beach. One thing to note is that for some reason the address is wrong everywhere - the salon is located at 509 West 236th St (near Riverdale). I'm definitely making this place my permanent nail salon.
