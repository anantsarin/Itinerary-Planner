I love shopping here for my wife. She is overseas right now and when I go to visit her I always bring her something new from Vanity! They have unique separates and coordinates and very good prices. I stop in about once each month and everytime I find 10-20 new items that I know my wife will love. They also have a frequent buyer discount program. The staff are great, and all of the women who work there are big fans of the style of clothing sold in the store. Even the in store music is great!!! You can always find blouses in there that you can't find anywhere else, so stop in and check it out!
