Great atmosphere and wonderful waitress! We decided to have pizza but oh what a pizza. We tried the Neapolitan pizza and shared the Greek salad. The salad was huge, more than enough for two. Loaded with goodies, dressing was slightly bland. The pizza dough was phenomenal, and cooked with olive oil. So, so good! Loaded but not over loaded, I look forward to trying the others.
Average Pizza, and Average Wings. I have had their food a few different times, and it seems as if this establishment suffers from consistency  issues. One time when we ordered the large sheet style pizza, I was very happy  and impressed with the sauce, cheese and crust. Recently ordering a smaller size, traditional pie, I was not impressed with the flavor of the sauce, or the ingredients, they just tasted off to me. The wings are pretty good and meaty, with a wide range of sauces and flavors. I would not write home about this pizza, but in a pinch, it is pretty good, and again not over priced for the area. I've never actually eaten inside the restaurant, so I can only speak for the take out.
The Mediterranean Haddock was a perfect choice. It was perfectly done with an array of tomato and red onion atop. The mixed summer squash was nicely done as well. Relaxed atmosphere with outside dining .
Fabulous pizza and warm, wonderful staff. We've been a few times and have always had a great experience, but our last visit was the most telling. We'd walked there from nearby and the weather appeared lovely. But while dining, a torrential thunderstorm developed. Rather than have us stranded on foot in the pouring rain and fierce lightning, the host offered to drive us back. Service doesn't get any better than that. Thank you, Andriaccio's!
Great ambiance and spectacular food. Pizza needs work but for great Italian food in our area it is in the top tier. Calamari to die for and homemade sausage is out of this world.
We were very impressed with our meal.  We ordered the medium Neapolitan pizza and a Greek salad.  It was enough food for two adults and a child with some leftover!   The food was excellent.  It was evident they used olive oil to make their pizza and it tasted like I was eating something healthy as opposed to most pizza at other places that makes me feel disgusting from all the grease.   It was clean in both the dining area and the bathroom.  The waitress was both pleasant and prompt to assist us.  The restaurant had a good family dining atmosphere and the prices weren't bad at all.  Our bill was only $30.   I definitely recommend you stop by!

After waiting twenty three minutes for a table, we finally get seated. The power goes out no more than four minutes later. Yes. The whole restaurant is lightless. Mind you, it's about 7pm, the sun is going down. No candles. No nothing. Just dim sunlight creeping in threw a nearby window. "Uhmnn... I can get you some water for now but that's about it. I'm not sure if we are going to be able to make any more food" "Is there a near by restaurant?" I ask. "Let me find out," she says as she heads off. By this point 411 is being called, we are asking about a restaurant we believe is a few miles down the road. The waitress comes back, "I know there is a restaurant nearby and I have a cell phone that works, but I don't have their phone number" .... Is this chick for real?? "It's ok, we are already calling" "Oh... Ahm, good good. let me know if they have power so I know either way" REALLY THOUGH. Come on. Get a clue.

They have a separate take-out entrance and then a restaurant entrance as well. I ordered a turkey sub here one day and it was OK, but took them 30 minutes to make it for take-out. The next day, ordered a pizza and it was gross.  Not exactly sure what it was but something didn't taste fresh (either the cheese or the sauce). You don't have too many options if you are in this area, but just choose wisely when ordering here.

Boo.  Andriaccio's is one of the worst spots to stop around the lake (and there are some pretty bad ones!).  Their food is not good and the pizza is mediocre at best if you hit them on a night when their ingredients are fresh.  It's strange because eight years ago when we started coming to the lake it was a pretty good restaurant.  It has gone seriously downhill.   A new place opened up about a year ago in Mayville (on the NW side of the lake) called Greenstone Bakery.  Look it up and call them- their pizza is really tasty- I would almost go so far as to call it gourmet pizza.  We have ordered about ten pies from them, all have been excellent with no wait.  Or, order from Guppy's Tavern across the lake in Bemus Point.  Great pizza there as well.

This is the closest Italian restaurant to Chautauqua Institution so there is a somewhat captive audience in the summertime. I was there for an early dinner in mid-October and there was a respectable turn-out on a Friday evening and by the time I left, someone was waiting for my parking space. I know a lot of people go there for pizza and I had heard some unflattering comments about it, so I ordered the lasagna. It came with a skimpy, somewhat tired-looking salad and nice warm bread. I've had better lasagna. This example was generously layered with meat and cheese, but the flavor was quite bland and the sauce rather runny. However, I was a big fan of my dessert: I ordered the Tortoni and expected a little round ramekin of vanilla ice cream with crumbled toasted almond on top, but what I got was quite special... The tortoni itself was a firm frozen custard with small chunks of almond mixed in and it was served on a dinner plate surrounded by rectangular pieces of fried dough sprinkled with cinnamon sugar and drizzled with strawberry sauce. The fried dough was thin and flaky and not at all heavy like a zeppoli can sometimes be. I could not finish it, but I loved the blend of flavors and the presentation. My waitress was very friendly but was a little overwhelmed by a large party a the adjacent table and I was a little surprised when none of the other staff broke away from their private conversations to assist her. The price was reasonable, the decor pleasant and I wonder what other dessert treats I should try next time.

Awww, I'm so sad to read all these bad reviews!  Here is my take on my Andriaccio's experience. We went there for lunch on Monday 8/29/11, around 1:30pm.  The dining room was terribly understaffed - we were there for over 5 minutes before being acknowledged, and another 2 minutes or so before we were seated.  There seemed to be only two waitresses for approximately 15 tables of diners, but the two women were pleasant and seemed to be really trying to keep up.  The woman who waited on us was nice to the children (two boys age 4 and one boy age 1) and gave them coloring menus and crayons. She was very busy with other tables for a while then did finally come take our order.  With how busy she seemed I was worried we'd be waiting forever for our food but it seemed to come out pretty quickly (we had a party of 7 - we ordered one large pizza, two children's (10") pizzas, a portobello panini and a chicken finger platter) and the food was delicious!!!  The portobello panini (grilled caps, sauteed peppers, and blue cheese) was the best I've ever had, anywhere, and the homemade potato chips were yummy too!  My husband devoured his chicken fingers and the battered fries that came with them were super good too.  My son liked his pizza (I ate some too) and it was good.  I did not try my friends' chicken pesto pizza but they said it was really tasty. Thumbs WAY up for the food.  It's too bad about the service - I was hoping they were just understaffed that day but it looks like slow service is a common problem.  Management should definitely address this problem, because I could see how it could be enough to keep someone from coming back, but the food was so good that I'm looking forward to our next visit to the area!

Really not impressed. The pizza dough is not that great. Having made fresh pizza dough before it seems like this isn't fresh, hand tossed. It seems to be the frozen kind but I have a friend who insists they make it fresh. Ordered a steak and cheese sub and it seemed like scrap sirloin steak, loaded with fat and tendon, was pink and red in different spots. The chicken wings were not crispy, really big but loaded with fat and not good. Sad, such a good location.

Andriaccio's is my favorite pizza in these United States. It can be a bit pricey, especially if you're piling on the toppings, but it's worth it. My favorite crust, and I love their zesty sauce. Nick and his staff are always friendly.  I'm grateful that my parents know that whenever I'm coming home for a visit, an Andriaccio's pie is my first dinner home.  I have to respectfully disagree with the lack-luster reviews left by others. I've been eating Andriaccio's pizza since they opened many years ago, and still find it to be the best I've ever had.

I've been going here for so many years and the place really hasn't changed very much.  We last went around Easter time and they were remodeling half of the restaurant, which meant the wait for a table was more than 30 minutes (kind of a pain with two young children).  The owner was great though.  He was actually going to set up a table for us in the room that they're remodeling so we didn't have to wait any longer.  Maybe not the most sanitary offer, but a great gesture nonetheless.  The food was good (not amazing, but good) and our server was really great with our little girl.

This place used to be the bomb... Its local to Chaut Institute but my past experiences haven't been that good here..

In fairness we've only used this place as the local place from which to order pizza for delivery while staying at Chautauqua Institute during summer. Based on those (roughly 5) experiences the pizza was good. But delivery was often very late.  Recently the pizza was 30 minutes later than their 45 min promise. And it arrived warm but far from the "piping hot" expectation I have for a place that is 5 minutes away. Too bad they can't seem to get their act together on delivering hot pizza on time.

We visited yesterday afternoon and had a delightful late lunch. The oysters on the half shell were huge and delicious. We had the greens with sausage on garlic toast points and it was flavorful with just the right mix of spices. Our favorite part of lunch was meeting Guy Andriaccio and his son, who is now the owner. Guy spoke of how he brought his wife and children from Buffalo 35 years ago and bought the old gas station and transformed into a great restaurant adventure. I wish we lived closer (we live in Pittsburgh) but when we visit Chatauqua in the future we certainly will be stopping back.

Great pizza, great service!  We've been going here for years, and the food is always consistant.

Andriaccios catered my wedding earlier this month and I was sooo very impressed with them! Everyone was so kind, professional, and accommodating. Sally knows exactly what she is doing and really takes the stress off of the host (bride in my case).  Everyone loved the food and the bartending was also a hit!!

Awful pizza.  Restaurant has great rep, but I don't understand why.  It's location near CHQ Institution grounds is well known as a restaurant, but the Bemus location is terrible.  Pizza is mushy, and pepperoni are tiny--the edges curl up and burn. Instead try Crosby's takeout. It's a convenience store near Greenhurst, but it has pizza ovens, and the pizza is excellent.
