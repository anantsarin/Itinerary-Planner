Overall this is a great venue to see a small concert. It is much bigger than you would expect looking at it from the outside. There is a very large and roomy bar area, a huge area off to the side with booths, and then a pit area right in front of the spacious stage. Working bands would dream about playing in a place like this, because the stage is big and there are plenty of areas for people to watch the shows. I was here for a show, and the bands had plenty of room to set out merch and mingle with the crowd. There are plenty of bartenders and people around to help you--on a approaching the bar, we never had to wait for more than 10 seconds to get a beer. Granted it was Tuesday night, so it might get a lot busier on weekends, but it seemed like Lost Horizon could accommodate pretty much anyone that would come see the caliber of bands they host.
This place is probably one of the worst concert venues I've ever been to. The bar is pretty nice. It's big and has two sides so it's easily accessible even with a crowd. The merch area is pretty large and flows well. That about all I can say that's complimentary. The stage area is horrible. The floor is too small, the ceilings are way too low, and the way it's partitioned and separated by stairs, there's almost no room. Also, because of the low ceilings and a few other factors, the sound here is probably the worst I've heard in all my 29 years. It just bounces around and gets so muddled. I drove here from Buffalo for a show, but regardless of the band, I won't make the drive to this place again.
