Recently dined here with a friend. They take reservations- BONUS POINT. I got the fish fry, friend got the steak gorgonzola sandwich. I LOVED the fish fry. The fish was perfectly beer battered and fried, salt potatoes on the side were good, one of the best mac salads I've had out (had a homemade taste, not that weird, sweet chemical taste), and coleslaw was tasty too. Friend did not love the steak sammy. Said the meat was tough and the proportion of meat to bun was wacky- was hard to hold. Also said the steak needed a sauce or something- didn't have a lot of flavor. The only complaint I had was that the table was sticky and the water glasses were small and not refilled enough. But for me, the fish fry was delicious. I'll probably be back.
Found this on Yelp when looking for a Friday night meal with my wife and daughter. Easy to find, spacious dining room and bar. I love Guiness and they know how to pour one! The right temperature !  We had the sheppard's pie, the lamb stew and a steak sandwich!  Their signature is the Potato Chowder, so of course we had to try it. The lamb stew was outstanding.  Reminded me of my trip to Ireland.  My daughter liked her sheppard's pie, way too much for one person, so she took out the leftovers! The atmosphere was great with the dim lighting and fireplace!  Lots of beers on tap !!!  Wait staff is wonderful!

I happened upon Shannon Pub unintentionally because I'm not often out this way.  Needless to say, I will be back on a regular basis. Highlights: Top notch service.  Incredibly friendly staff (including servers, hosts and bartenders) that moved quickly to ensure that we could get a table by the live music.  Our waitress was very helpful with menu suggestions and was always there when we needed her, without hovering. Food was excellent for a reasonable price.  The poutine fries are to die for, as was their beer cheese soup (the best beer cheese soup I've ever had).  My entree wasn't anything special but it wasn't bad.  One of my friends had the fish sandwich which was unbelievable! The beef stew was a little too salty but still excellent. Great beer selection.  The end. The live music was fantastic.  They were a South Buffalo band named "Crikwater" and are the best Irish band I've ever heard in Buffalo.  Hands down.  The room got into the music and we all had a great time. I have no cons about this place (other than the fact that it's in the suburbs and I live in the city!).

Great food and really filling! The bartender/ server, Bryan, was great and even helpful about things to do in the area. The potato chowder was filling and flavorful. The appetizer of stuffed mushrooms is a meal in its own! The Reuben on rye is delicious and I was sad it was gone. The beers on tap are extensive and worth trying! Go there and enjoy being Irish for a meal!

Great place for a drink with friends. I love that they have the ring game, between 2 (REAL!) dartboards. Always a friendly crowd and great bartenders. I've only eaten there on a few occasions and it's usually splitting some sort of deep fried something with a group, but no complaints! I would give them 5 stars if it was a little brighter and some of the furniture/furnishings were in better shape. It makes it feel divey-er than it really is!

How much do we like the Shannon Pub? So much that we had our wedding here. Very good food, especially the Fish Fry. I would also recommend the Saturday and Sunday Irish breakfast. Is any of the food here revolutionary or high-end? No, but it's very good, especially for pub fare and Irish specialties.  Don't forget a pint of Guinness!

The Shannon Pub never disappoints. First, start out with a perfectly poured Guinness Stout. Yummy! Next, their potato chowder is to die for. If you are in the mood for chicken wings, they have deliciously prepared, slightly crisp but still juicy wings with awesome blue cheese. If you love Buffalo fish fries, the Shannon Pub has the best fish fry in the city. The fish is huge and crispy and the french fries are breaded!!! They have live entertainment at least three nights a week, and they specialize in awesome Irish bands. This is a fun place to be any night of the week!

Came here the weekend after the St. Patrick's Day weekend rush was over.  Guess I still needed the Irish holiday to last longer than a day or weekend.   Ordered up a Guinness (of course) to start off dinner.  It was poured absolutely perfectly!  The pour is key in making a Guinness taste even better than it already is...mission accomplished Shannon's Pub! For appetizer started off with spinach artichoke dip and the poutine fries.  The spinach artichoke dip was a thicker version than what I was expecting and was quite good.  The poutine fries were pretty good, but not as good as some of the other reviews I read on Yelp had described. For dinner I decided on the Bangers and Mash, since I never tried it before and tend to order my personal favorite Shepherds pie dish every time I go to a tradition Irish restaurant.  The Irish sausage was cooked perfectly, and filled with flavor (a hint of breakfast sausage taste) and juiciness in each bite.  A side of sautéed onions was included and went well with the sausage and mashed potatoes.  I think I have a new favorite Irish dish to choose from after eating here.   Definitely will go back again.

I love the Shannon Pub. It is the only place I have been where the food quality is consistently excellent! The fish fry is awesome and I love the mac salad. My fish is always hot and never greasy.  They make their own mac salad and tartar sauce, and I think that they make the coleslaw too because it never tastes old. How much do I love their food? I want to take out-of-town guests to eat there. Their potato soup is to die for. When we order, I get a bowl to eat for an appetizer and I order a bowl to take home, As long as you leave the lid off when you get home so that it cools, it will not separate. The only complaint I have is that the fries are battered, but as I never eat them anyway, it is not a big deal for me. As a plus, they have GREAT entertainment on different nights during the week and on the weekend. LOVE!!!!! Hope to eat there soon.

A good friend of mine works here so I love coming here to see her but they have a friendly staff and good food. Love the rueben and my dining companion LOVES the poutine fries. Nice place to relax. They also have live music quite often.

This place is so much fun. I would think it's often overlooked due to the location but once you're in here, you'll feel like you're in your local neighborhood dive and not the madness that exists on Niagara Falls Blvd. The first time I came to this bar there was an amazing Irish band called "Crikwater" - dates can be found here : crikwater.com   - they'll appreciate "Table 1" advertising :). This band alone would have got me to come here again. I ordered the Fish sandwich w/ coleslaw (awesome slaw!) and beer cheese soup (on special). Everyone else ordered from the traditional Irish choices (shepherd's pie, guinness stew, etc) - but the beer cheese soup by far is the best I have ever had. If you're feeling very naughty you should also try their Poutine - because gravy and fries love each other and you will love them. I have to take a moment and say that our waitress was fantastic. Joking around with our table while still providing some of the best service I've had in the area. Their traditional Irish grub is a little salty but I would prefer it over Ulrich's - which is extremely sweet in my opinion. My second trip was made in conjunction with Crikwater's next show. Get a table by the stage for these guys! Irish music is just down right fun...so much so that I've considered slapping spoons around in my spare time. The table consisted of a mix of salads, poutine, and reubens - all which were choices you couldn't go wrong with. Good prices, great atmosphere and a beer list that satisfies. Come when there is live music and leave happy!

Always pleased with my experience at Shannon.  I usually just go there for beers and sometimes I'll end up having finger foods.    However, last weekend I decided to have a sit down dinner.  I went with their wings and they were perfect.  I ordered medium, and they came out crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Far better then anything I've had at other "famous" places.  I also had their fries, which had some sort of beer batter on them, and they were pretty damn fantastic.  The service was great and they helped accommodate my young kid (who loved her grilled cheese sandwich).  The prices are also very reasonable as well.
I love Shannon's! The Guinness Stew and Bangers and Mash are great! Nice beer selection and good prices. Parking can be a pain on the weekends.

Never had Lamb stew before - it was the best. This place has the real thing when it comes to Irish food. My wife also commented that the fish here is also a good choice. Friendly atmosphere with good, simple, Irish Pub food.

Damn fine pub food. I had the twice baked potato soap, one of the best I had in a long while, great flavor. For dinner I had the Lamb Stew, not bad, was nice for the rainy day out, matched the weather. The drinks were ice cold, as they should be. I will definitely be back. Hopefully I will get to try the Fish Fry everyone is raving about.

This is my husbands favorite place!  Their roast beef on weck and rubin's are delicious and they make the best tasting potato soup ever!!  Their menu offers traditional irish foods and they also have a Great selection of beer.   Definitely a very authentic Irish pub.

The first time I set foot in an Irish restaurant, and Shannon's Pub did not disappoint! We sat outside on the patio, which is somehow nice and cozy, despite its small size and humble view of the parking lot. (Tip: do not sit next to the tree. There will be bits of twigs raining down on you.) They have a daily special and I got the Fish Fry (Which is the only not-so-special daily special, because it is actually available every day). Nevertheless, the wait for my Fish Fry was well worth it. Out came the waitress with this huge piece of fish atop the plate. Not to mention a bowl of potatoes and a heap of coleslaw and pasta salad. Not your typical healthy fare, but certainly delish (if you have more discipline than me, you can get the fish broiled instead). The beer-battered fish was very fresh (caught from the Great Lakes... maybe?) and had just the right crunch. My friend got a sandwich which came with crunchy tasty french fries. The prices range from fantastic to average, depending on what you get. There are some items, like steak, which can be around $20. The daily specials (these include pork, turkey, and my fish fry of course) are nearly all under $10, and my friend's sandwich was about $8 - about the same as Panera Bread or any other of those cafes. So for us, the prices were definitely fantastic.

One best Irish Pub around. Live music nearly every weekend if you love Celtic Irish music. There Potatoes soup is out of this world.

This is a decent neighborhood bar with a good kitchen. They stock a good line of draft beers and an impressive line of irish whiskeys including some I had never seen before. Lots of flavored vodkas for the ladies (or whoever drinks flavored vodka - certainly not me) But it is a comfortable place with VERY FRIENDLY VERY NICE STAFF. They make a very decent steak salad. The vegetables in the salad are fresh but are otherwise nothing special. But the steak is a superior econo-steak - tender and lots of flavor. They cut this with lots and lots of blue cheese - and that is just fine by me. So you are basically chowing down a ton of steak and a ton of blue cheese - but its healthy - right? - because its a salad. I like the way these people think. ********I My base review is printed in its entirety above - and I still think everything I said there. The following section is written for people who love to Yelp Review - - - and who write a lot of Yelp Reviews. Here is your bonus track: Is the Shannon Pub in Tonawanda New York an Irish Restaurant or a neighborhood pub? Or how do you tell the difference between an Irish restaurant and a neighborhood pub? Cheap cop out preliminary answer - its both since it has two rooms. There is the all restaurant room with no bar and no TV - and there is the all bar room with a bar and TV where you can order anything they have on the restaurant menu. Non-cop-out answer: There are two entertaining complexities in categorizing restaurants: 1) Globalized cuisine - that the food off of one nation's menu shows up on the menus of a zillion other nations. Globalization comes in three flavors. 1a) The Unity of English Commonweath food. Irish food and American food are very similar - as are English food Scotch food Canadian food, Australian food New Zealand food and South African food. The stock of Anglo-saxon settlers brought their food all over the world. There are a VERY small number of dishes that travelled less - So not so many people do Lancashire Hot Pot - making that dish truly English. However, lots of people do roast beef so even thought that is the quintessential English elegant dinner - it is eaten all over the world. In the case of Irish -lots of people have borrowed corned beef and cabbage - not so many people eat colcannon. 1b) The fact that people adopt other people's food left and right. Nothing is more American than pizza and nachos - though in both cases we know where those dishes came from. 1c) Some truly local dishes have clones all over the world. EVERY part of the world does a fried fish. Call it a parrillada, call it an Irish fish fry, call it a Cape Cod fish fry, call it just fried fish but eat it in Vietnam, in Indonesia, in Korea or Ethiopia. And yet - this is often a local dish in which people take great pride. (ever go to a Cape Cod restaurant?) In the case of the Shannon - you can order their Irish pot pie which only they have which is Irish. You can order corned beef and cabbage which is irish but also is heavily new england. You can order their Irish fish fry which is a global dish. 2) Cooks like to cook different things just to keep things interesting in the kitchen and they often like to spread their wings and show their range. Pretty much 2/3 of the Shannon menu is not at all Irish. They are located in a Buffalo suburb - so they take pride in their Buffalo Wings. They do a lot of burgers. The steak salad with blue cheese that I had was quite fine - and reflecting the chef playing around in the kitchen with a steak and greens figuring out what his or her angle would be. Cooks are often like actors or actresses who don't want to be type cast and want to show their dramatic range. The actress who always puts on a cheerleader costume, has illicit sex and then is always killed by the vampire thirty minutes into the movie would love to just once play a diplomat facing an international crisis. Application to Yelping - and an entertaining story. In Japan I was once taken to a cutlet restaurant that was known throughout the region. There were fifteen kinds of Japanese cutlets on the menu and everyone was eating the cutlets which were justly famous. The sixteenth and last item after the fifteen kinds of cutlets - was sashimi. I ordered the Sashimi and my hosts univerally said I was nuts and wasting a once in a lifetime opportunity. It was the finest Sashimi I had in Japan. It blew away any of the Sashimi I had in more pretentious all sushi and sashimi places. It was the culinary high point of the trip. The cook had always had this capacity to get good fish and do great things to capture its taste. He or she could never do that in their cutlet house. But given a chance - the cook totally shined. So is the Shannon grill an Irish restaurant or a neighborhood pub? It is both. Places with good cooks are often places with lots of exciting and unexplored potentials. And they fit all sorts of different categories.

From the outside this place looks like an aging Irish Pub that had its heyday in the 1980s and probably isn't much worth visiting anymore (but doesn't everything on Niagara Falls Blvd?!). Well, the first fact is pretty much true, the second one not so much ;) It's definitely worth a visit, not just because it's simplistically hokey (the Irish memorabilia inside is sure to simultaneously amuse and disgust you), but because it does a few things right: Guinness and Irish food. The stage and sound system are also logistic winners, drawing in a number of touring acts such as Seamus Kennedy, as well as Western NY regulars like the Dave North Trio and the Dady Brothers. What to try on the menu? The corned beef is EXCELLENT. Thick-cut, tender, not too fatty - it probably is the best in Buffalo, as the menu shamelessly purports. I'd also recommend the Shepherd's Pie and Irish Lamb Stew. I always appreciate a place that wants to offer the lamb version of this dish -- more traditional, stronger in flavor and more tender. A fun-loving pub that marries the down-to-earth nature of Buffalo with the meat-and-potatoes of Irish immigrant cooking!

+ good fish, good service - sour coleslaw Came here on Good Friday for the fish fry.  Arrived at 4:30pm and it was starting to get busy.  If you order the Fish Fry before 5:00pm (the early bird) then it's only $10.  We ordered two fish frys.  Waitress was friendly.  We sat in the dining room where there are a few TVs and lots of tables.  The place needs renovations big time, however, the high ceiling is a nice touch. Our plate came out within 20 minutes, piping hot.  Fries are coated with breading, tasty.  The beer batter fish we got tasted really fresh, but batter was a little too heavy for me.  The coleslaw tasted bad/funky, really sour.  The tuna pasta salad tasted pretty good. All in all, not a bad meal, but nothing to write home about either.

Our plate came out within 20 minutes, piping hot.  Fries are coated with breading, tasty.  The beer batter fish we got tasted really fresh, but batter was a little too heavy for me.  The coleslaw tasted bad/funky, really sour.  The tuna pasta salad tasted pretty good. All in all, not a bad meal, but nothing to write home about either.
I'll bet sit down service and food would beat the takeout my wife, myself and her larger family got last night. Mostly fish frys were had but nothing special.  We split the crab stuffed haddock. I was pleasantly surprised by the crab stuffing as it was not overly creamy. The haddock was a bit bland. I don't care for Mac salad or coleslaw so it was disappointing to not be able to substitute. Too many good places in Buffalo to go again when takeout the first time left more to be desired.

I stopped in here for lunch for the first time over the weekend. They have a nice selection of Irish beers and a well-constructed menu that incorporates Irish favorites (like Reuben sandwiches, bangers & mash, and lams strew) with a few nice "Buffalo-friendly" beef options and even some seafood choices, as well. They also have daily specials to keep things interesting for regulars. Our waitress was fantastically friendly and personable. It was honestly some of the best service that I've had in awhile. Our food came out in the perfect 15-minute window, while, in the meantime, our server was attentive without being overbearing. From the atmosphere, I have a feeling that the place is a lot busier on a weekend evening than on a Sunday afternoon. Before I bump my rating up to 5 stars, I'd really like to come in and see how they handle a Friday or Saturday night rush. Still, it was a great first-time experience all around!

This place doesn't look like much from the outside, but don't pass it by! We were visiting from out of town and were in the mood for some Irish grub, and we found Shannon Pub on Yelp. As we pulled up, we kind of went, "Eh, what do you think?" not because it looks bad, but because it looks more like a pure bar than a restaurant. We decided to go in and were rewarded many times over. Everyone we encountered in the pub was friendly--even the people just walking around and not specifically serving us. There were not many people eating, and the service was quick and excellent. The food... oh lordy. I've never had Irish food like this. The poutine (granted, not Irish), the chicken pot pie, and the shepherd's pie were absolute home runs. The pastry crust on the chicken pot pie was so soft, flaky, and delicious, I could have just eaten a big plate of crust. Grocery store-bought pot pies are permanently ruined for me. Great stuff, compliments to the chef.

Worst meal I've had in probably the last 2 years!! I had the salmon dinner. Asked for it cooked medium..it was well done and nasty. I opted for double vegetables for my sides which ended up being brussel sprouts. Yeah I love brussel sprouts..not frozen, boiled, unseasoned old ones that when I cut them in half they had a weird brown-pink color. I also had a dinner salad..if that's what you want to call it..old iceberg lettuce, boxed croutons and old tomatoes. Oh and the "dill sauce" that came with the salmon tasted like margarine and old dried dill. Eww. I understand this is an Irish restaurant so I tried my coworkers meal too..the only thing I thought was ok was the corned beef. I left there completely dissatisfied and had to go get food because I was starving. And to top it off the service was horrible. Had to go and try to find our server to get our bill. Stay away from this place!!

We were in town for a hockey game at u of b and looked for palace to eat on yelp.  We found this place and were very pleased.   There were 11 of us, so we tried a lot of different things on the menu.  Ribs, Lamb stew, corn beef and cabbage.  We tried them all.  Food was very, very good. Bar had a great selection of beers and an Irish entertainer/singer. Great food great beer and great atmosphere.  The only reason that I did not give it five stars was the service. It was very friendly, but our waitress continually forgot to bring our complete orders.  We had to remind her that we ordered soup, we got a side dish with our meal, etc. If you are looking for a great place, stop in. You will definitely enjoy it

THE SERVICE SUCKS SOOOO BAD!! If you stand at the door waiting to be seated, be prepared to wait for like 10 minutes! Not because they are crowded or anything, but the waitress is just not in the mood to come up and take you to an open table!! Yes! She sees you every time she passes by just doesn't care!
Unfortunately I can only judge by my brief late night visit. Upon my entry at 9:50 PM I asked the bartender if the kitchen was open. Yes, he answered and handed me a menu I went to a table and my hunger grew as I reviewed the traditional Irish favorites. He came to the table with the menu open on the table. I was deciding between the Irish Stew and Shepherds Pie.  I ordered an iced tea and asked if I needed more time.   I did. When he returned I asked which was better? ONLY NOW DID HE TELL ME THAT I COULD ONLY order sandwiches. They stop serving the full menu at 900!!!! What a waste of time! I never would have sat down if he'd told me    only bar food was available. If you manage this place. Please find train the help to inform your customers when the kitchen quits serving the full menu when asked  "IS THE KITCHEN OPEN"! I left and thanks to yelp satisfied my hunger! Very disappointed.

Recently dined here with a friend. They take reservations- BONUS POINT. I got the fish fry, friend got the steak gorgonzola sandwich. I LOVED the fish fry. The fish was perfectly beer battered and fried, salt potatoes on the side were good, one of the best mac salads I've had out (had a homemade taste, not that weird, sweet chemical taste), and coleslaw was tasty too. Friend did not love the steak sammy. Said the meat was tough and the proportion of meat to bun was wacky- was hard to hold. Also said the steak needed a sauce or something- didn't have a lot of flavor. The only complaint I had was that the table was sticky and the water glasses were small and not refilled enough. But for me, the fish fry was delicious. I'll probably be back.
