Too bad.  What a shame.  I went there today to watch team USA. Great game, good atmosphere BUT..... The bartenders were pretty mediocre.  Not able to handle a large crowd.   The worst oart was at the end when getting the bill.   They intentionally raised the prices for a pitcher of beer from $16 to $20 just for the game!   When I asked the bartender she blamed management. What a low class move.  as a member of The American outlaws who have made this bar as their home base, to intentionally get up charged is outrageous.   I will never set foot in this place again or McGuilicuddy's  in New Paltz (same owner) Absolutely horrible management and service!
By all appearances this place looks like it would be cool....DO NOT BE FOOLED. As I write this my group has been sitting for almost 2 hours; we have maybe one server who hasn't been back to check on our drink order more than one time and I can't tell you how the food is b/c we're about to walk out. Not one person came over to is to apologize or even explain why things are so slow & the party of 9 that got here prior to our party of 14 hasn't gotten their food either. If I could write a review with '0' stars I would definitely do that. Unbelievable.
The Mad Hatter will always leave a bad taste in my mouth, but not this place! I've been here quite a few times, mainly for their burgers. Every time I've gone I've gotten a nice juicy burger on a flavorful bun. Sometimes the bun makes the burger but I think here its the whole package. Sure it might be traditional bar fare, but that's to be expected, especially if their kitchen is open all night. The potato chips that come with the burger are good too, dusted in Parmesan. I've also had the Irish nachos, waffle fries with cheese and bacon, good for what they are. And the wings, I will say great sized and great flavor, I ordered the honey buffalo, not sure that's what I got because I didn't taste any sweetness to them at all. Either way, they were very good and got spicier as you ate them, what every buffalo wing should do IMO! I'd go back again, if for nothing else but their wings and burgers!
My fiancee and I plus 2 friends came to Union Square shortly after they opened. We attended their Tuesday dollar taco night which included $8 margarita pitchers and we all had a blast. Tacos were stuffed and excellent tasting, margarita pitchers were strong and tasty, beer was awesome. Then we went again, the 4 of us, about a month later, for the same thing, taco night. Well, this was a horrid experience. First, we learned they are still advertising $8 pitchers of margarita but in fact they did away with it and only offer $5 for a pint glass of VERY watered down margarita. Second, the tacos were falling apart but the order did come to our table correct, despite the fact that each person had to sort the tacos because the chef prepared them in groups, meaning he grouped all beef all chicken all pork tacos in the same baskets and we had to sort out who got what, not very professional. Third, I ordered a pitcher of coors light and I understand tap beer is watered down but this pitcher might as well have been water. Horrid! Fourth, when we got the bill, all tacos were not $1 but $1.50. When we asked, she said they now charge for cheese and sour cream, which we did not ask for, but apparently received and were charged for. I would rather make margaritas at home and have someone run to taco bell then go to this place again. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!

Amazing wings !! We had two types. The honey mustard wings had a balanced heat and flavor. The traditional were done in an upstate fashion. Love the atmosphere and prompt service. We are returning when we get a wing fix!!

We decided to check this place out after finding out that they have food until 3am, something that seems rare in PK without going to a diner. The menu seemed alright so we checked it out. The place is pretty nice on the inside, sorta typical bar scene but that's fine. Then came the food. We just grabbed a table because there seemed to be no one around for seating (the only person who said hi was the kareoke dj setting up). A waitress came over after a couple of minutes, didn't introduce herself, just asked what we'd like to drink. She was nice enough, it just seemed like she was annoyed that we were there. We ordered the gorgonzola calamari with balsamic dipping sauce- this was the worst of the food. It sounded like a good idea, but it ended up being just really rubbery/chewy calamari with a little bit of crumbled blue cheese sprinkled over it. Not to sound dramatic, but probably the worst calamari I've ever had. I ordered the union burger and my girlfirend ordered the mac & cheese. After a couple of minutes our waitress came back and told her that she didn't know this, but because it was after 10pm (it was maybe 10:20 at the lastest) they had a smaller menu, even though she gave us the full menu. So she reordered just the cheese curds. How she didn't know seems odd, because she didn't seem new, because for the rest of our time there we could see her sitting on the counter in the kitchen. My burger came out and it looked alright. Its served on challah bread with a potato pancake and cheese. The bread ended up being soggy-ish. The potato pancake was the best tasting part, the american cheese was super metly and the meat itself was really greasy and bland, in addition to the fact that I asked for it rare but got medium (even though this is really common at most places I've been I still had hope). The burger comes with homemade chips which were over-fried and completely unseasoned, if I had actually wanted fries there was an extra charge, which seems shitty in my opinion. My girlfriends cheese curd was pretty good, but I think its hard to mess up fried cheese. Overall, the place was nice inside, our waitress was nice but preoccupied, and the food was not good. I probably wont be back, at least not for food.

The food was very good. I got the Union Burger and fries, which came with a very good sauce to drizzle on them (forget exactly what the waitress called it). Still have yet to experience the nightlife, hope it's not the same old "Hatter's".

great food my personal favorite is the pulled pork quesadilla friendly service. This place makes me feel very welcomed and like im a part of the staff. very friendly. I recommend you come here especially during happy hour. I'll be back and be brining people with me.

Great place to chill with friends. Especially by the outdoor bar in the summertime.

I was with the party ryan m is referring to. I got my food to go, 2 hours later..and got food poisoning~! stay far far away!

Been there a few times.  Their menu is small and its just bar type food.  Union Burger was bland, fries were not crispy at all, just limp.  I think they put parmesan cheese on them, odd choice.  Ordered a potato chip app one time, where they toss potato chips in buffalo sauce and put cheese and other toppings on it, sort of like idaho nachos with a upstate NY twist.  It might have been good if they just left out the buffalo sauce, the chips were literally soaked in the stuff, limp as well, seems to be the way they like to do things there.  It was not edible, waste of $9.  I went back recently just to grab a quick draft, there might have been 6 guys tops in there at the bar and it was 1am.  Bouncer at the door said in a thug like tone it cost $10 to get in the place.  Any bar where employees leave the 'r' off the word dollar and replace the 's' for a 'z' is just plain posing.  Could at least say please if you're asking for that much in that sort of tone.  I walked out, not going back...EVER.

Pretty solid place to eat. Worth the money, good atmosphere, i would go back again
