Excellent food, reasonable prices, good service.  Do yourself a favor and dine here.
This is a great little hole-in-the-wall sushi place (nestled in between a starbucks and a Quiznos), and it happens to be one of my favorite restaurants in the Poughkeepsie, NY area.  I'm normally something of a sushi/sashimi snob and generally not one for rolls. But  I love the bonsai roll (by far the best thing on the menu).  Among the hot foods, the seafood yaki-udon is pretty yummy.
Fast fresh and fabulous!!!
The food was great and reasonably priced for sushi. It was definitely some of the best sushi is ever had and will be bringing my friends here.
Really delicious sushi, and the rolls are big! All for a good price.
delicious sushi.. service was friendly..a little bit pricey. I had take out, so I did not sit down.
This is by far the best sushi in the area! This small, unassuming establishment is a beautiful example of what a restaurant should be. I have been frequenting Bonsai since the day they opened and the quality continues to impress me. The staff is very friendly and will do their best to accommodate any special requests (the only difficulty is the occasional language barrier). Try the wedding roll from the specials board (tempura shrimp, avocado and mango inside topped with white tuna, black tobiko and spicy sauce)  it's out of this world! If you like spicy, try the John roll (spicy scallop and avocado with yellow tail, jalapeno and spicy chili sauce) - delicious! Whatever you decide on you won't be disappointed.
Best sushi around- so fresh and delicious. Love love love
Best sushi take out in Poughkeepsie. Prices are excellent for what you get. Instead of  the 15 rice filled rolls you get in other Poughkeepsie sushi joints you get 6 good pieces from every roll. Lunch specials and happy hour are key. Highly recommended.
This place is a little tough to find as it's in an alley in a mini-mall, but trust your iPhone and iWant.  Ask for Steven the sushi chef or Lily the waitress.  They will take care of you like family.  I highly recommend the Momokawa cold sake, but bring a friend to drink with you unless you are a very experienced sake drinker.  It comes in a chilled 750ml bottle and is 18% alcohol, so watch yourself and designate a driver for the trip home.  The sushi is outstanding here.  Great presentation, thank you Steven.  Outstanding freshness.  Lily makes sure you are absolutely taken care of.  I had several of the house special rolls.  Spicy is my favorite and the kick did not fail to please.  After more sushi than a person eating single should have eaten, I ventured to try the tempura fried bananas with green tea ice cream.  Absolutely fantastic with the Momokawa Pearl sake.  This place is a treasure of Poughkeepsie and highly recommended by a veteran traveler.
The sushi is amazing!! The crunchy roll is my favorite!!
Execellent. Fresh food and really good! Definitely worth a try!
I no longer live in the area; however whenever I visit I insist on going to Bonsai 2.   The Sushi is Fresh, sweet and delicious!  The rice in the rolls is sooo flavorful, tender and fresh!  I ordered the Alaskan Plate and the rolls were huge!  The waitress was so cute; she told me this dish was "good for my skin".  Love my Omega 3's!  The Green salad with ginger dressing was crisp and tasty.  My Miso soup was flavorful and not too salty.  We went with our good friend, Jake and the Sushi Chef made up an appetizer on the spot for us of Spicy tuna on a BBQ pringles chip topped off with a squirt of BBQ sauce....it was amazing!  I have had the teriyaki bento box before; it was tasty and filling.  I tried a glass of the Plum Wine and it was so smooth and sweet; like candy!  We finished off our meal with the Tempura Ice cream..yum.  I have yet to find another Sushi place that even comes close to the freshness, abundance and price of this great place!
This and the other Bonsai location are my favorite sushi locations in my area. Their happy hour and lunch specials are so cheap and you can try a ton of appetizers for a very affordable price. They also have an extensive sushi menu with pictures showing the delicious things you're about to eat!
Food is always on point. Service is quick no matter how busy it is . Waitresses are always there for refills or anything else you need . Can not ask for much more than that
First of all, LOVE this place! Super cheap, super delicious sushi. Their hot tea is the best and I always order edamame and gyoza. Sweet potato tempura roll and spicy crunchy yellowtail are delicious! If you're a garlic fan, I recommend the crunchy garlic roll. They are pretty fast and I like the ambiance. Service is okay, but I don't expect the best at a sushi restaurant. If you're from CIA, looking for a good place for sushi, come here. Mizu isn't worth the price.
Love this place. Drove an hour to get there...everywhere near me is a rip off compared to bonsai! Wish they had brown rice option
Try udon soup very nice... Love the staff & simple decor !!!
Fantastic sushi and unusual selections. Absolute favorite is garlic sushi. My wife is also quite a fan of the pumpkin sushi. There are many inventive rolls here and the price is very reasonable. Best sushi I've had in the area. The decor is a little stale (kind of a picture of what you would think an average japanese restaurant should look like in an encyclopedia) and once the waitress brought me my check before our dessert arrived. That said, I make a point of going here every time I'm in the area. It's very good.
Really delicious sushi and udon noodles! Great prices and friendly staff! Highly recommend!
I got a couple veggie sushi rolls.  They were pretty tasty.  All of them had avocado, and the avocado was fresh/tasty.  I was impressed by how many vegetarian sushi options they had, and the price wasn't bad: around $4 for 6 rolls.  I didn't notice any tofu rolls, which would have been good, but I still liked what I got.  One roll that I enjoyed was the mango avocado roll.  I had never tried mango in sushi before, but it was pretty good.  Although, to be honest, I couldn't taste much mango -- it ended up being mostly avocado.  Still, if you're in for the novelty, you should try it.
When this place first opened I never ate here. I had a bunch of other sushi places that were in my rotation so I just never had the time. Then I moved away for a few years and when I moved back my friend took me here and I instantly became upset I never tried this place sooner. There are quite a few sushi places in between my house and Bonsai but when given a choice it really is a no brainer. I love their spicy maki combo it hits the spot every time. I also really love a lot of their special rolls and I always steal some sashimi off the boyfriends plate. If you haven't given this place a try yet you definitely should.
Definitely become my favorite place to eat! The sweet potato sushi roll and shrimp is very good! Decent prices, food is filling, and the environment is very relaxing no doubt! Check it out people.
My new favorite sushi joint. Consistent and delicious. Great staff too. Try going during happy hour- try a few rolls and apps for a great deal. As for specialty rolls, the sunset boulevard roll is as delicious as it is pretty and the kani su roll is light but filling. Another fave is the golden lobster roll (I love mango!)
I've driven past here MANY MANY times and I always wanted to give it a shot.  The rolls are ambitious but not overbearing.  Delicious is what I call this place. The service was lightning fast and our server was very polite.  I truly wish this restaurant was in a better location; don't get me wrong, it's in a really good spot near Barnes & Noble and IBM, it's just that in the location of the plaza, you can drive right by it; like I did time & time again. If you love sushi, do not pass Bonsai by.  Excellent all around.
This is my favorite sushi bar of all time:) the ingredients are fresh. My friend steve from hong kong is the best owner. He always welcome customers with a big smile. Steve knows how to hook up the sushi. the outside patio is good to use during the spring, summer and fall After closing; I stay in sometimes to share the delicious cooking prepared for the staff ( not available to customers..VIP)..overall this is the best sushi place in the hudson valley. It was also featured in the poughkeepsie journal. Check them out.. you won't be dissapointed
Happy. Hour. Sushi. You can't get a better deal for sushi than that in Poughkeepsie. Also had The Incredible roll. HNNNG. If you get a bento, you can also get miso soup and salad. It'll fill you up, no problem. Really good deals all around. Trust me. I'm Asian :p.
Looks like i have been obsessed with sushi ,or  am i obsessed with the Wasabi burn?? Whatever the reason is,i came to Bonsai for lunch.It's located next to IBM and Barnes and Nobles(i do love the idea of reading and eating sushi all day)   The place was kind of dark even during the afternoon with mauve+pink walls and black tables,it almost looked like a Hookah lounge,but not so fancy! We ordered the Veggie sushi; rice wrapped up with Tofu skin and 6 pieces of Avocado sushi and one sweet potato and mango avocado with a spicy mayo topping and of course the Wasabi and pickled ginger sat by the sushi rolls screaming * Eat me and Burn!*   They also served a tiny plate of lettuce with peanut sauce and Miso soup,the soup was kind of salty so i ended up eating the seaweed and mini tofu bits in the soup.The sushi's were actually huge and it was impossible to put the whole roll at one time.But they were pretty good and the rice wrapped up in tofu skin was so chubby,that you just have to bite it!!   It's a good place with huge sushi rolls.I would suggest you to practice some yoga to make your jaw open up like a shark. :) -Smriti
On another recent visit during happy hour we tried a fabulous appetizer, appropriately named Dynamite. It was a bowl of white tuna tempura, seaweed salad, julienne cucumber drenched in a delicious peanut butter and sesame oil sauce and topped with chopped peanuts.  There was plenty for two to share and at $3 - it was serious highway robbery.  No, not a typo.  THREE DANG DOLLARS. The service was a bit spotty- the waitress actually delivered the wrong plate to us and didn't realize it.  We finally grew suspicious while staring at the quanity of food on the plate.  There were about 4 different rolls on one plate - and none of our group ordered more than one roll a piece. But seriously who cares?  With food this good, fresh and cheap - I wouldn't mind if they rang a bell and made ME go to the kitchen to get my own food!  That's how much we like it.
Great prices and good portions for a Japanese restaurant. My daughter who loves sushi came out sick from overeating the dinner bento comprised of several sushi rolls. All of which were delicious. We took my leftovers home and she ate it for breakfast the next days. There was too much dressing on the side salad so I couldn't eat it. Miso soup good. Wait staff friendly, place clean.
Even though the restaurant itself isn't that old, I cannot imagine how we survived (sushi-wise) in the area without it! Located right on Rt 9 in between a large diner and other shopping establishments, it provides easy access for a fresh and delicious snack/meal after shopping. I was here with my girlfriend grabbing lunch one day and we absolutely loved the bento boxes. They were beautiful, delicious, and I have nothing bad to say about them. While we didn't have much interaction with the staff, the establishment itself is very clean and well-kept. Although a little small, it manages to still fill up the seats and turn them over in regular fashion. I haven't been to the happy hour there yet, but from what I see on the menu, it looks to be great as well!
So a friend and I came here for my bday and we both ordered a bento box dinner. Those teriyaki things are  DELICIOUS! I got all rolls with my bento and my friend got chicken teriyaki :/ it was disgusting. Well actually it was dangerous, it was under cooked and tasted toxic. It took a while for us to get not one but to waitresses to understand that she wanted something else yet somehow in not understanding each other they convinced her to just get the same thing. Although cooked and much better the second time I'd stick to raw fish (make sure to smell and look at you food before you digest it). Besides that it was great, well mine was. Nothing a cold Asahi couldn't fix :)... Also they are so cheap they give you to go chop stick (the splinter in your intestine kind). So go check it out :D thumbs up for the authentic music, now if only they can do something with the indoor decor.
This place has great sushi!! They have lunch specials from 11-4 and happy hour from 3-7. A must go in the Spakenkill area.
Excellent food, reasonable prices, good service.  Do yourself a favor and dine here.
Bonsai has fresh, delicious sushi at very reasonable prices. If you can make it during their happy hour, you can really get an incredible deal, but even their normal lunch and dinner specials make it very affordable. The location is a little out-of-the-way, in that it's not visible from Route 9, but if you're willing to sneak in between Quizno's and Starbucks, you'll find it, and you'll be glad you did. If I could change one thing, it would be to make the staff willing to mark takeout orders. When I've done takeout for 5-6 friends, the orders are mixed and it's sometimes hard to figure out what's what... but sometimes that's the fun of it, and you end up trying new things!
This is a great little hole-in-the-wall sushi place (nestled in between a starbucks and a Quiznos), and it happens to be one of my favorite restaurants in the Poughkeepsie, NY area.  I'm normally something of a sushi/sashimi snob and generally not one for rolls. But  I love the bonsai roll (by far the best thing on the menu).  Among the hot foods, the seafood yaki-udon is pretty yummy.
This review is based solely on a take-out experience. With that said we ordered quite a lot of food when I visited Bonsai (something in the order of 10 rolls + a few appetizers). The food came out quickly, especially considering the amount, and we were even served tea while we waited; perfect considering the freezing weather outside. I'm not sure about the hours, but the happy hour deal they had going on was incredible--between $2.99 and $3.99 per roll. The fish was extremely fresh and the appetizers were delicious (although the portions were a bit small). I'm not sure about the service, but the few patrons who came in while we waited at the sushi bar were greeted and seated quickly. If you're in the mood for sushi, and in the Poughkeepsie area, give this place a shot.
Fast fresh and fabulous!!!
There are two Bonsai restaurants now, one by Starbucks across from Barnes and Noble and another one in front of the Poughkeepsie Galleria with the same owner (we asked). My wife and I love going to this restaurant.  I usually get the lunch bento box and my wife gets the two sushi lunch offer. The bento box comes with two fried teriyaki rolls in a tasty sauce, which is my favorite part of the meal.  My wife avoids the raw sushi as a personal preference, so I can't vouch for any of that, but she loves the sushi that is either cooked or does not contain raw fish. I love Bonsai and would give it a 4-5 star rating if not for a bad experience there.  I ordered a dish that I thought I would like, but it tasted bad and had a rubbery texture.  Because the manager/owner was not in, they refused to take it back. Otherwise we always have had a good experience there.
The food was great and reasonably priced for sushi. It was definitely some of the best sushi is ever had and will be bringing my friends here.
This is definitely not a 5 star restaurant, however considering it's location I can see why some people would give them this rating which is why I gave them a 4.   Anyway, the food was good overall.  We ordered about 10 of their speciality rolls all of which were pretty good.  The volcano roll was not what I was expecting and was not too pleased with that roll.  The seaweed salad had a strange taste. Negative - no Japanese beers, service was slow. AmEx not accepted. Overall good! Would come back. We're moving up Highland!
Really delicious sushi, and the rolls are big! All for a good price.
While Akari in Poughkeepsie remains my favorite Japanese sushi restaurant, I have been to Bonsai 3 times and I like it a lot.  The prices are reasonable and the staff has always been very attentive and gracious.   The dining area is kind of small, so it would be difficult to accomodate a large group here.  I have tried several different rolls and sashimi dishes (as well as several appetizers) and the food has always been fresh-tasting and enjoyable.   I recommend this relatively new establishment to those who like Japanese sushi/sashimi type cuisine.
delicious sushi.. service was friendly..a little bit pricey. I had take out, so I did not sit down.
Great sushi!! Actually ate at the Bonsai 2 location.  Really nice atmosphere and clean establishment. Food was really good and reasonably priced.  The waitress was really nice and took time to show our son how to use chopsticks.   Definitely going to come back for another round of Sushi!
Some of the best and freshest sushi I've ever had! Sashimi was fresh and full of flavor. They had some really interesting rolls. Didn't get to try a lot because we were a small group and came for happy hour. I'll definitely come back to try the rest of the menu. I highly recommend the mackerel sashimi. Great for the area! I have had better elsewhere, but only by a slim margin. Wish I could give it a 4 and a half.
This is by far the best sushi in the area! This small, unassuming establishment is a beautiful example of what a restaurant should be. I have been frequenting Bonsai since the day they opened and the quality continues to impress me.

If you like spicy, try the John roll (spicy scallop and avocado with yellow tail, jalapeno and spicy chili sauce) - delicious! Whatever you decide on you won't be disappointed.
Two words come to mind when thinking about Bonsai. Holy $@#$!. The food is amazing. I decided to go in on an afternoon just out of chance because I wanted sushi. I was seated with my party immediately and the menus were given to us and drink orders were taken immediately. Bonsai has an abundance of Maki rolls made in so many styles its almost mind blowing. The food was great and we came at a time were they had happy hour specials. Apps were 3 bucks for goyza and other items. There is seriously nothing negative I can say about this place. I reccomend it to anyone who doesn't mind Americanized sushi.
Best sushi around- so fresh and delicious. Love love love
Sushi outside of NYC is pretty poor. We've tried several, but most are 'Asian fusion' (which translates that no one type of Asian food is done well). We were craving sushi and saw Bonsai on Yelp and gave them a try. Made it in time for happy hour which I recommend. The rolls were good size and tasty. They had some nice flavor combos and we recommend the sweet potato roll for some variety. I would say that this is the best place between NYC and Boston for sushi, give it a shot. Oh, they have nice outdoor seating for good weather.
Best sushi take out in Poughkeepsie. Prices are excellent for what you get. Instead of  the 15 rice filled rolls you get in other Poughkeepsie sushi joints you get 6 good pieces from every roll. Lunch specials and happy hour are key. Highly recommended.
This place is a little tough to find as it's in an alley in a mini-mall, but trust your iPhone and iWant.  Ask for Steven the sushi chef or Lily the waitress.  They will take care of you like family.  I highly recommend the Momokawa cold sake, but bring a friend to drink with you unless you are a very experienced sake drinker.  It comes in a chilled 750ml bottle and is 18% alcohol, so watch yourself and designate a driver for the trip home.  The sushi is outstanding here.  Great presentation, thank you Steven.  Outstanding freshness.  Lily makes sure you are absolutely taken care of.  I had several of the house special rolls.  Spicy is my favorite and the kick did not fail to please.  After more sushi than a person eating single should have eaten, I ventured to try the tempura fried bananas with green tea ice cream.  Absolutely fantastic with the Momokawa Pearl sake.  This place is a treasure of Poughkeepsie and highly recommended by a veteran traveler.
Ok, first off, if you haven't been to Bonsai, get there NAO!!!!  Best sushi ever and good salad and soup too!!  Even the tea is very good!!!!  I usually get the maki combo either spicy or regular, or sometimes I get the happy hour rolls (reduced price at certain times during the week).  The service is not the best, but also not the worst.  While they are not the friendliest servers in the world, they are attentive and bring out the food quickly, sometimes too quick!! The sushi rolls alone are reason to try this place, and then the happy hour menu is a good chance to try nicer rolls at a low price.  The place is fairly small and doesn't have a hibachi table, but you can sit at the sushi bar if you want (I'm never comfortable doing that).  All in all, A+!!!!
The sushi is amazing!! The crunchy roll is my favorite!!
A nice place to go for lunch during work.  It is also nice to bring the family on the weekend.
Execellent. Fresh food and really good! Definitely worth a try!
Bonsai has been around for a little while and for some reason we had overlooked trying it. We still were walking around with our unfulfilled sushi hankering when running errand we spied Bonsai, one of several businesses in the South Road shopping and eating plaza. Bonsai is a modestly sized and tastefully yet simply appointed place with a dozen or so tables and a sushi bar that seats maybe 5. We were seated and promptly attended to and tempted by their lunch special menu brimming with all sorts of sushi and kitchen nibbles. I opted for the Alaskan Sushi lunch which came with (no not an autographed picture of Levi Johnston)miso soup and a small side salad. Both the soup and salad were very good and as expected and not salty. My salmon dish consisted of 4 pieces of salmon sushi and a salmon avocado roll. No complaints. The ginger was not pink (good thing) and though the wasabi paste was a little dry it still offered subtle flavor to my fresh pink salmon. The service was great and my cup of delicious green tea was replenished as necessary. All in all Bonsai was not only a nice lunch stoppa and a good deal. youtube.com/watch?v=OnVU…
I no longer live in the area; however whenever I visit I insist on going to Bonsai 2.   The Sushi is Fresh, sweet and delicious!  The rice in the rolls is sooo flavorful, tender and fresh!  I ordered the Alaskan Plate and the rolls were huge!  The waitress was so cute; she told me this dish was "good for my skin".  Love my Omega 3's!  The Green salad with ginger dressing was crisp and tasty.  My Miso soup was flavorful and not too salty.  We went with our good friend, Jake and the Sushi Chef made up an appetizer on the spot for us of Spicy tuna on a BBQ pringles chip topped off with a squirt of BBQ sauce....it was amazing!  I have had the teriyaki bento box before; it was tasty and filling.  I tried a glass of the Plum Wine and it was so smooth and sweet; like candy!  We finished off our meal with the Tempura Ice cream..yum.  I have yet to find another Sushi place that even comes close to the freshness, abundance and price of this great place!
Pretty much feel like I am getting ripped off if I eat at any other Japanese place after eating here.  Killer food and options, KILLER PRICES!!!!  Go for happy hour and get major deals.  The Bento Boxes have wonderful options, a ton of food, and are totally reasonably priced.  I won't eat at any other place in the Hudson Valley.
This place is reasonably priced and delicious. Every time I've gone here the fish has tasted very fresh. They really have much larger rolls than some other sushi places, very filling! If I can't get to my favorite sushi place in Apple Valley this is definitely my second choice!
Good, fresh and inexpensive.   My wife and I almost always get the "Memories of Japan" roll, it's the star of the menu if you know about it.  The decor and space is nothing to write home about but if you go in warm weather there is an outdoor space.  We also occasionally do take out. The food is delicious with good service and we rarely spend more than $30 for the two of us. ******Recent Update******   Went for dinner and had the Sushi Pizza for the first time....Not something I would normally order but was feeling adventurous....WOW....Crispy little flats of tempura with beautiful fresh tuna, mango and other lovely bits!  It will be our new starter!
Me and my girlfriend love sushi and have been many Japanese restaurants in Poughkeepsie ,bonsai is by far the best in this area ,sushi is yum ,service very nice .i definitely recommend
Was there the other night. The service was good, even though they had a hard time understanding us. The food came super fast and was fresh and delicious! Huge portions and great prices, I was overwhelmed with the selections. The menu has pictures of their specialty rolls which really helps and they looked just like the pictures when they came out. I was very satisfied with ever inch of the night!!! I will definitely be going there again. (I'm a huge sushi fan and so far this has been the best I've had in the area!)
So good.  Got there a few minutes before 6 and got to hour from the happy hour prices.  I wanted udon since I had a headache but also ordered 2 rolls and 4 pieces of sushi.  I know alot for 1 person.  Total bill came to $27.
Here is where you can get the best bang for your buck, every time i go here i get a bento box dinner its about $16 & it comes with a California roll & something else i'm not sure what it is but it looks like some fired dumpling with like 2 or 3 different sauces on it, your choice of sushi roll & side if im not mistaken. And the deep fired Ice cream the batter is more cake like than crunchy but still delicious
Only my favorite sushi restaurant in the world!
You can't beat the prices of their sushi rolls and appetizers during their week day happy hours (3-6 pm).  Their sushi is pretty fresh and the service is friendly.  Their hamachi kama is probably the best in the area.
So a friend and I came here for my bday and we both ordered a bento box dinner. Those teriyaki things are  DELICIOUS!
