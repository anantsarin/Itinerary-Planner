The best place to learn and make friends. It's clean and convenient to any schedule. If you want to get into martial arts you couldn't ask for better instructors. Jiu jitsu changed my life.
Spotless new facility. Amazing instructors. knowledgeable friendly staff. Huge mat space. Early morning and evening classes which is good to fit any schedule. Clean large men's and women's locker rooms. Awesome high quality gear sold on the premises. Close to nyc and westchester. Â Members only policy so you don't have just anyone stopping by to beat on them. Family like atmosphere. As good as it gets when it comes to a martial arts school. Oss!
I've gotten the opportunity to train and experience several martial arts / Jiu-Jitsu academies from New York, North Carolina, California and Thailand and I must say this place is by far is one of the best Academy to train and learn from the best. The Instructors are very well knowledge and very detailed of their teaching. The students who train here are more of a family and help each other succeed in the art than trying to take their anger out on you or hurt you to show a high ego. The facility is very clean, spacious and very well ran. I've train here for over a year and will be training here for many years to come. Ouss!!
Great facility, dedicated knowledgable instructors, and very clean. The lineage and techniques are from top players in MMA ,BJJ Muay-Thai and Karate. There is also a variety of training partners, some with extensive martial arts wrestling and MMA experience and no shortage of newbies. Very welcoming and eager to teach and encourage all to achieve their goals.
