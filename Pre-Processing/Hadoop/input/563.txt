Love this place. The ladies there are great. I went shortly after getting a cast off my leg for a broken ankle and they took such great care of me. Got a great mani and pedi and will definitely return.
Went here for a day to relax with a friend given to us by our husbands as Christmas gifts. Â  Had a wonderful time and the ladies who did our mani/pedis were amazing!
The staff is very rude and did not offer good customer service. Apparently I came at an inconvenient time and felt very rushed. They even asked me to come back another day instead. I won't ever come back here.
