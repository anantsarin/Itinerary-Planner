My family and I hiked here today - we all loved it.  It was a great workout to say the least!  We started at the lower end and hiked up (and I mean up!) to the upper falls on the gorge trail.  It was roughly 2.5 miles and we were detoured along the way, which had us climb the cliff staircase.  The cliff staircase is no joke - very challenging, but worth it for the views.  All in all, you see lots of pretty waterfalls along the way. Then we hiked back on the rim trail, which was also pretty steep surprisingly.  You would think that you be going down, but a lot of the rim trail had an incline too.  My husband and I are daily runners and I would say that there were parts of the gorge trail that had us winded.  Nevertheless, that's what we wanted...a good afternoon climb with the family.  We'll be going back!

CAUTION: IF u hike from the upper to lower entrance via RIm Trail (vs Gorge Trail), be sure to stay on the right side of the trail going up halfway through the trail instead of taking the more narrow spur trail going left and down which dead ends at the creek. we made that mistake and wished there was a sign there! Overall it was a nice moderate hike w plenty of steps in between. if u cant hike much just see the fall at the lower campground (which u can swim in) and the Lucifer falls driving in from the upper entrance. The fall along the trail is smaller. $7 entrance ticket is good all day at any state park! Go check out nearby Buttermilk falls which is less than a 5 minute drive.

A must see destination. The falls and gorges are sights to behold and the hikes are challenging and fun.  My wife and I love this park and travel to it every time we visit Ithaca, NY.

Many aspects to the park. Overall I give it a 4. Hiking Trails ... 5 stars. Great 4 1/2 mile loop between upper & lower ends of the park... providing truly amazing views from both the upper rim and deep within the gorge - as well as an upclose of Lucifer waterfall. Whole trail is beautiful and well-maintained. It's challenging at times and long but easy enough for kids (our 8 year old did it fine). Swimming Area ... 2 stars Cool that you can swim at the bottom of the waterfall - and it's well life-guarded. But the waterfall also makes the pool perpetually cold (this review from July) and the pool floor is a bed of sharp shards of slate. Not fun at all really. Camping ... 3 stars Tent sites small and on top of each other. Maybe this is just the way State Park camping is ... but the row-house setup forced us to listen to dueling car radios, crying babies, endlessly inquisitive toddlers, gabby teens, and drunk adults -- fun for the whole family! -- but not relaxing. The camping area was clean however (the whole park was) and the park staff was friendly and accommodating. They also have a playground which was very impressive. That averages to a 3.3, I know... but since we really made the visit for the hiking experience ... I'll round up.

If you're a hiker, or a nature lover, or a person who wants to be awed by the majesty of nature, or just a human being, Treman State Park is for you. [Note: Don't confuse Robert H. Treman with Allen Treman Marine State Park on Cayuga Lake!] Lots of trails, lots of options, a LOT of dramatic scenery.  If Ithaca's got one thing going for it besides Cornell, it's the abundance of natural wonders. If you've got time, most definitely take that 15 minute drive (and it's a really nice drive) from downtown Ithaca to Treman and hike away to your heart's content.  The main trails can get a bit steep at times, but aren't too much of a challenge.

This is an amazing hike, but isn't for the feint of heart.  From the moment you start out on the trail, you will be hiking up, up, up a very steep trail.  When you think you've reached the top, you'll start to walk down an equally steep trail.  Just when you think you're about to plateau off for a bit, you'll start to go back up, up, up.  Your hike will continue like this for the better part of over 4 miles. Be sure to pack plenty of water, light snacks, and determination.  The hike is tough, especially when you're not expecting such a grueling path...but stick with it.  The views are amazing, and the flora and fauna are all around you.  You'll feel such a sense of accomplishment when you've completed the entire Rim Trail.

This is a great park outside of Ithaca that you must visit if you're into hiking, nature, gorges, waterfalls, seeing trout swimming from 50 feet up, and fresh air that smells faintly of pine and awesome. Tony is right when he says there are some steep climbs, usually on stone steps of some kind.  It's not a long hike, but at times could be a little tough on the little ones or if you're just out of shape.  It's really nice though, well worth the trip.  There is also a large natural swimming area complete with diving board at the base of the falls as you enter the park.  Gangsta.

There are only two water falls in the finger lakes that I think are "must see" falls for those stopping by from out of town, and this is one of them. Beauty: No trail in Ithaca is more stunning than Robert H. Treman State Park's upper gorge trail. While the waterfall itself at Ithaca Falls is just as beautiful, the unique part about the trails here is the gorgeous stone path carved into the side of the gorge. Even the bridges look like they were taken out of a children's fairytale. In most parks the paths detract from the beauty of nature but in this park the path enhances it! Accessibility: Its not that accessible from the heart of town. You do have to take a 10 min drive or so to get here. Walking or busing is not an option. The trails themselves are steep at times, involving many stairs and slants. That said you have a couple of options to make this hike much easier. Most of the glamor shots are near the top of the falls, so drive up to the top and walk down the path for only about a quarter of the distance and then head back up. The top of the falls also has more stairs to help you climb the steep hills. If you feel like swimming or diving, or seeing the remaining glamor shots you can always drive back down to the base. To do the complete hike you probably shouldn't be an out of shape, sedentary, couch potato, like myself, but If you can walk to Cornell or Ithaca College from downtown, you are in plenty good enough shape to do this hike. If you want to start at the top of the falls, from 13, turn onto Enfield Falls Road, and instead of turning left into the parking lot, continue for about 3 miles or so on Enfield until you hit upper park rd. and make a left, continue until you see the lot. Warning: The upper trail tends to close more frequently than others due to bad weather, so call ahead if you plan to go on that trail after a heavy storm. Price: parking is $7. However, if you have an IthacaCarshare account this is the time to use it because many of their vehicles are equipped with a free parking pass. This means that a short ride to this fall in a carshare car can be cheaper or close to the same price as riding in your own personal vehicle! Value: Because of the convenience and price point, I'd say Ithaca Falls (free) offers more value, but this park is a close second.

Very beautiful! We only went to the upper park. Take the hiking trail on the right that goes up the hill into the woods. Although you may not see much, it does have an overlook to see the upper falls. Then trek down some steep stone steps and cross over the bridge to the other side of the river. This is where the beauty begins. Walk back upstream and you know what I mean. The rock formations are geometric and seem ultra modern. Great place to take tons of pictures from many angles.

I saw the Enfield falls here around late 8pm and we didn't have to pay for parking! This was the 3rd waterfall I saw and I was still amazed. Waterfalls are one of the treats for your eyes. Plus factor- you get to dive and swim!
Wow, this park really blew me away. An almost endless array of cool waterfalls, waterways and gorges. Walking through some of them felt somewhat unreal. The overlooks at the top of the falls were pretty incredible, and all the channels along the gorge were like something out of Skyrim. So, yeah, I was walking along pretty impressed after passing every corner. A must see if you're in the area.

Amazing park. The hiking trails are to die for (and you might literally feel that way-- they are very difficult), but there is a refreshing swimming area at the bottom of the trails. The waterfall at the top of the trails is absolutely stunning. I camped there with my boyfriend last summer, and the campsites were great. There are different types of sites to meet the needs of all sorts of campers. My three year old nephew also came for a visit and they have the most giant playground I have ever seen. He had hours of fun climbing the rock walls. All in all a wonderful state park and campground-- great atmosphere, campsite, workout, etc.!

This park is amazing. Trails are clean, people are generally friendly, the falls are awesome. Great place to walk/jog while taking in some beautiful scenery.

Our 5 mile hike was 3 hours. We took it easy and took breaks, but this is still a pretty serious hike. Lots of steep inclines and tough climbs, so keep that in mind before picking it. We took the Gorge Trail up and the Rim Trail back, skipping on Lucifer Falls and the cliff climb. We likes the Gorge Trail better - there were spots for paddling in the stream and more photo ops of the beautiful stream and falls than there were on the Rim trail, but loved all of it. What stunk was that we really wanted to swim in the swimming area, but it was closed for clearing of storm debris. Well, that's what we were told, it didn't look at all like any clearing was happening. We'll definitely hike here again!

Definitely start at the upper park and hike down. When we went to the bottom section is was closed due to water quality--it really looked kind of gross. The upper part is amazing though and more than makes up for it.

Beautiful waterfalls. The upper park is magical! And there is a cool old mill at the upper parking lot. The bottom section includes a nice swimming area with lifeguard. The 2+ mile hike between the two halves of the park was very nice. I'd suggest parking at the bottom and hiking to the top along the Gulch and cliff stairs trails. Don't miss the Upper Gulch trail! The hiking isn't super difficult, but there are several steep sections with stairs. The round-trip is a good half-day hike.

5 for the beauty of the park, 1 for the experience of camping there. Sites are too expensive, muddy, and way too close together. There also appears to be no coordination with the local authorities regarding who's paid to be in what spot. A patrolling sheriff rudely awakened and questioned me in the dead of night regarding what I was doing in the spot I'd paid for, and this despite my showing the park-issued decal clearly in my vehicle window. He was a jerk, and it was absurd.
