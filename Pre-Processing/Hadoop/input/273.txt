terrific programming a new york space that should be on your list of things to keep an eye on.
I went to Lehman College Center For the Performing Arts to watch Patti LaBelle live in concert. I enjoyed it. The venue is very nice. The only downside was a slight issue with the sound system. After the issue was fixed the volume became much too loud! It was loud enough that one would have needed Ear Plugs. Patti must have sense this because she avoided belting vocals throughout the concert. The restroom was clean. Thank goodness there were no unnecessary, annoying restroom attendance. It would visit again for another concert. However, I will ear plugs in case I need them.
As good as it gets! I'm a FAN of this place for a GREAT price & EXCELLENT shows.
