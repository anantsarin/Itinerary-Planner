I came here with my boyfriend, his sister and my coworker. It was amazing. We had such a good time. It was really easy to get everything straight, safety wise and everyone who worked there was really nice and chill. There were plenty of places to get off the trail if you needed to and there were plenty of places for staff members to "rescue" you if you needed to get down. I would most DEFINITELY recommend it to everyone and anyone. It was amazing.

This place is freakin' awesome.  Different levels of difficulty for all different types of people on the ropes course.  The zip lines are long and plentiful, and the mountain coaster is cool and a blast, in summer or winter (ropes course is not open in winter, duh).  Great staff, lots of safety precautions but they don't take away from the fun. Zip lines are long, high and awesome.

Donna, who works at check in, was very helpful, very accommodating, very overall awesome! She went above and beyond to ensure we got in and our kids got into the aerial park without a problem. Lots of fun, great exercise, beautiful surroundings!

My review is based on a comparison to another climbing/zip-line course in the Adirondacks, "Adirondack Extreme." This course in Ellicottville pales in comparison. Negatives: - your experience is timed.  You get only 3 hours to do whatever you want.  In the Adirondacks, you can take however long you want to complete all the courses.  Here in Ellicottville, if you get stuck behind slow people, you're screwed.   - Not all that challenging - or at least challenging in really annoying ways. They have this system of "pins" to unlock the carabiners.  They use this annoying system to make things more challenging (i.e. you have to hold on with one hand while unclipping with another).  Some obstacles are fairly challenging, but they aren't as thrilling as the ones in the Adirondacks.  I completed the Black Diamond course (the second hardest) but did not attempt the Double Black (the most challenging) because the first obstacle involved a tiny little ladder where you had to clip and unclip after almost every step - just plain annoying. - Too many kids.  Some of the obstacles really should not be accessed by kids.  It slows everyone down simply because they are too short to reach some of the clips.  Which results in a staff member having to intervene, thereby holding everyone up (and remember, you're being timed! tick tock). - Some of the staff was downright miserable.  The girls putting you in the harnesses wouldn't even return a hello.  Guess they're annoyed at having to touch strangers all day. - The course is congested.  You don't really feel like you're out in the woods away from it all.  There are tons of people and you can see what everyone else is doing (the Adirondacks was spread out and breathtakingly beautiful). Positives: - The staff on the course were friendly and let us do the last ziplining course even though our time expired (it may have helped that we had some cute girls in our group). - There is a course that is almost exclusively zip lining which was pretty fun.  But it takes forever to get through this course because it is ridiculously busy.

I took my husband to Sky High for his birthday and we had a great time.  It was a little pricier than our typical outing, but for a birthday surprise it was doable.  I like that you're able to choose your own itinerary for the day with some guidance of the staff.  We had never been there before so we had to start with the beginner/yellow course.  We then jumped to a blue course before tackling one of the black diamond courses.  We finished up with a blue course and a green course.  It was an exhausting day for us, but it was so so much fun.  One of the other reviews complains that there is a three-hour limit on climbing, but honestly, our muscles were giving out at the end of three hours and I consider us to be in decent shape.  I mean, American Ninja Warrior we are not but we're no slouches.  If you're ready to take on more than three hours of this stuff then good on you but I think that three hours is completely sufficient for most folks.   We opted to go on a weekday to avoid huge crowds.  It seemed to work well.  There was only once when we had anyone else navigating the same course as us.

Fantastic addition to Holiday Valley - Sky High is awesome.  It's a ropes course set into the woods just off of the Tannenbaum Ski Lift.  They have different levels of challenging courses delineated by ski signs - green circle for easiest, blue square for intermediate, and black diamond for most challenging.  The black diamond courses are the best - extremely high zip lines over the slopes.  It's completely safe as it's impossible not to be hooked up to the safety lines with their double locking system of carabiners. There is sometimes a wait but they traffic the course pretty well to avoid major back ups.  It's only open in the summer months except for the mountain coaster which is open year round.  The coaster is great too, a long trip up and back down the mountain in your own roller coaster car that you can control the speed.

My son(16yrs old) and I had a blast. When I mentioned this to him, he thought I was crazy but we both had a great time. We did not try anything too difficult but we will one back. This was a great experience.

Fun, challenging, physical.  Worth doing even in the rain.
