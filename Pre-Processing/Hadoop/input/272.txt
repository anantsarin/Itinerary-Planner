I love going up to this Papyrus.. Great and excellent staff. Their cards are collections of arts.. It's extra ordinary designs are worth keeping and it's been a hobby just having them for ages. The place where it's located is an awesome place to stroll .. You can walk with your dog and lots of parking. When I feel like I wanna see like a gallery of Â cards I find myself here.. @ Papyrus Bronxville You gonna Love it here!
Stopped in here when I was just walking around the neighborhood. Such a cute store, have great little gifts, cards, etc. I love stores like these. I know papyrus is a chain because I've seen it in other states as well, but I don't know if every store sets their own prices, this particular store was a little more pricey than I had expected. The girls in the store were very helpful and nice, and acknowledged me as soon as I entered, which of course always makes you feel special. A+ for papyrus!
I love this Papyrus. Not only for the friendly staff, but the great card and gift selection. I scored some great deals today on the tail-end of their semi-annual sale, which begins right after Father's Day. Something to note for next year!
Did my wedding invites here and it was the easiest wedding chore I did. I worked with Kristen, and I really can't say enough nice things about her. She was down to earth, patient, receptive and HELPFUL. She was knowedgeable about how to word the invites and we really relied on her guidance. When the proofs came in, she went out of her way to get a change made that was important to me. The Westchester Wedding Machine is a MEAT GRINDER of an experience and this was the only vendor we dealt with that was hassle-free. Invites were expensive. And perfect. I'll pay for perfection.
