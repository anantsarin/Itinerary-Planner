A nice change of pace from other local shops like Craft Company No. 6 or Parkleigh.  It's not a large shop, but it's loaded with stuff -- interesting housewares and clocks, as well as a separate room of books (with quite the emphasis on green living and wellness). I've picked up a couple of different items here -- the prices are good but not ridiculously expensive, like you'd expect from a store in the area.  (I mean, really, some of the shops around this neighborhood can have some overpriced stuff.) UE also has a mailing list you can get on, announcing specials and sales on a monthly basis.
I went to this shop when I was back in Rochester in early June of 2007.  It's owned by the owner of Starry Nites Café (see my separate review) and therefore I wasn't at all surprised about the good selection & pleasant environment.  I bought some nice items there and the prices were reasonable (considering the quality).  The sales clerk was a very friendly young woman.
