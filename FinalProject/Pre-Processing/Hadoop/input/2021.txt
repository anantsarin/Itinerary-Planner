Home cooked authentic German food need I say more... It's what I imagine traveling to Germany would be like, accents and all! I find the atmosphere to be relaxing and comfortable and all of the food at Black Forest Adler is exquisite. If your a fan of German food, or even you're a first timer I highly recommend going to Black Forest Adler! The food and drink are top notch, I recommend the Swabian goulash with sauerkraut and red cabbage, or the sauerbraten, or any of the sausage dishes! You can't go wrong, everything I've tried has been very authentic tasting and well made. Oh and if your dining in their many riesling offerings go well with any dish.
Six of us had dinner here last night, and while the place is cute and the food is good, the service was lacking and it was sooooooo hot inside that escaping to the parking lot felt like entering an oasis! It took a while for our drink orders to be taken, and once they were four of the six drinks were brought to the table and then two reminders were necessary for the other two to be brought.  It took a while for our dinner orders to be taken.... and once they were it took 45 minutes to receive our food.  I guess that's better than having it come immediately and knowing that it was previously big-batch cooked and reheated in the microwave.  This stuff tastes fresh, authentic, and made with love. The potato pancakes we shared for an appetizer were thin, crisp on the outsides and tender on the insides, and perfectly seasoned.  They came with a choice of a (teeny tiny!) side of either applesauce or sour cream (or both for an extra 55 cents).  Bread was not brought to the table, but it is available for an additional  charge (nice, fresh, seeded rye with real butter). For an entree I had the "Allgauer Kaesespaetzle" (Homemade noodles topped with cheese, then piled high with crispy onions and served with a German salad).  The salad was SUPPOSED to be a spoonful each of cucumber dill, grated carrot, corn & bean, macaroni, and real German potato salads, topped with field greens & romaine tossed with creamy homemade dressing and croutons. It was very, very tasty, but contained NO German potato salad and no field greens.  I didn't mind the lack of greens.... but no German potato salad in a German restaurant? Come on! The "Allgauer Kaesespaetzle" was an iron skillet of homemade (!!!) spaetzle baked with cheese and lots of butter and topped with crispy battered onions. It was delicious and very, very filling.  Four of us ordered it and only one person could finish it (my teenaged son).  I tried a bite of my table-mate's "Sauerbraten" (Top round of beef marinated in wine, vinegar and spices) and found it fall-apart- tender and absolutely delicious. The only REAL disappointment of the night (we could have overlooked the sometimes spotty and slow service... and perhaps the air conditioner was broken... and maybe the salad maker forget the German potato salad) was the fact that the two desserts we were most interested in trying were "sold out".  The restaurant opens at 4:00 and we were there at 5:30 and already neither the Black Forest Cake nor the Linzer Torte were available.  Very, VERY disappointing!
Gemütlichkeit! Black Forest Adler does a fine job representing this word meaning a peace of mind filled with warmth/hospitality/comfort. Our server was efficient and seemed well versed in the menu. They have a full selection of wine and German beers. I went with the Weihenstephan Hefeweissbier which was poured in the traditional tall Weizen glass. The server also brought out the bottle to look at which was a nice touch. Good value for a large beer!  I can highly recommend it as a great accompaniment to your meal. Some pretzel sticks are available for snacking in little barrels on the table. I ordered the Paprika Schnitzel with Spaetzle for a side. It came with a very nice salad of mainly lettuce, croutons, and some veggie/macaroni surprises underneath in a tasty dill dressing. The Schnitzel was two very large pieces of the pork. The breading was even and flavorful (thank you for not being too salty), cooked perfectly, and the meat very moist. The pepper sauce on top had a bit of a sweet and sour vibe to it. Some sauteed sweet peppers in it and it was an excellent accompaniment. The spaetzle is probably the best I have had and was not gummy or mushy. I could eat a whole bowl of just that. I took home half of my meal and it was delicious the next day for lunch.  I also had the chance to sample some of the Limburger cheese platter and the potato pancakes and both were tasty and generously sized for appetizer-portions. They did not skimp on the desserts, and we split/shared at the table. The chocolate hazelnut sundae was out of this world. I love anything hazelnut flavored and this hit the spot. I also love apple desserts and the apple strudel had very nicely cooked apples, a flaky crust, and was also served with a generous scoop of ice cream and whipped cream. The owner/chef came out to check on our meal which I think we all enjoyed.  I have had sampling of German from a friend's family over the years and have always had an appreciation for it, even if I don't get to eat it a lot. There are a few places in Buffalo, but I was impressed with everything here. Don't let the plaza corner spot in the suburbs fool you, this place is very warm and welcoming on the inside.
Delightful atmosphere, authentic German recipes, and a wide selection of wines/German beers are some of the reasons I feel 5 stars really aren't enough.  From schnitzel to sauerbraten, you'll find the complete German dining experience here.  Do not miss!
If you're craving delicious German food + bier + mind blowing desserts, go to Germany...or come here. No, seriously. Kommen hier. Tucked away in a hidden plaza on Niagara Falls Blvd, the Black Forest Adler brings a little German spirit to Buffalo. The ambiance is cute, with little nutcracker dolls and German kitsch abundantly displayed and decorated with. The interior is spacious and comfortable with German music lightly coloring the experience. The food is obviously very German. Wurst, Spaetzle, Schnitzel, potato pancakes. I think the most American thing on the menu is the Chicken Cordon Bleu. I had the Goulash, which was a hearty stew of pork and mushrooms served with Spaetzle (German noodles) and a salad. The first course -- the salad was delicious. Greens dressed in ranch with green peas, carrots, beans and a little German potato salad. Definitely more interesting than the typical "few lettuce leaf" salads that are usually served with a meal. I had a chance to try a friend's Jager schnitzel and it was very freshly made and full of flavor. The schnitzel breading was perfectly done and you could tell the meat underneath it was fresh and full of flavor (it's easy to use lower quality ingredients when so much breading is used, but such was not the case here). Dessert was the highlight of the meal. This place has really amazing desserts --- don't miss out if you come! I ordered the hazelnut ice cream to share, but also had a chance to try some apple strudel and both items were fantastic. I came with some Yelp friends and we had a great time. Service was nice and pleasant. If you're craving some authentic German cooking, don't miss out!
So, so good! I was able to sneak in here during their dinner hours (wed-sun from 4pm until 9ish) and was surprised at how authentic it was. Our server had a German accent and was able to describe the German menu to us in detail. My mom and I opted for the sausage sampler and then both had the special for our entree. Way too much food but it was great as leftovers the next day. Only negatives are the hours and that it is such a hike out on Niagara Falls blvd.
I will admit I am not well versed in German food. I'm sure my great grandparents are rolling over in the grave as I write this because I am very German. However I do know fresh food and that is what I received at this very cute establishment. From the wood paneling on the outside of the building. To the wall clocks in the main dining room and the yodeling coming from the speakers this place screams german in a very tasteful way. Walking in we were greeted by a very nice hostess who said it would be a few min until a table was ready. She offered us menus and pointed us toward a few chairs so we could sit. It only took about 5 min for a table to be open and we were seated and then we waited and waited. A waitress came by and said she would be right with us. A few min later the hostess came back and took our drink orders. Our waitress brought our drinks out and asked if we were ready to order. I said I had a few questions. She had other drinks on her tray and said she would be right back but she wasn't. Long story short flagged the hostess down and got our waitress to come over. Asked my questions and ordered some food. We went with the curry wurst I believe it's called for an app. It was pretty good. The pretzel that came with it was still cold in the center and was a bit dry. For my entree I choose the Wiener Schnitzel with spudsters instead of French fries. Would have done german potato salad but they were out. It also comes with a German house salad. It was so good. The fresh dill dressing needs to be sold in bottles so I can take it home. Bry also ordered the potato soup. It was different and very good. Definitely something to try if you come here. The schnitzel was fresh and crispy and everything I had hoped for. The spudsters were also amazing. Crispy little pieces of potato heaven in my mouth. They also need to be packaged so I can have them when I get a craving. I know I will. It's that good.  For dessert we chose Black Forest cake and apple strudel. As well as a glass of Riesling to wash it down. The cake was ok. A bit dry but the strudel was insanely good. Warm, flakey, crispy, and not to sweet. My mouth is watering now. Bottom line... service is a bit spotty. However you should go for the amazing fresh delicious food. Go get you some!! Like now!!! And tell Hans I say hi;)
Excellent family run restaurant.  The food is all amazing.  I love both the Currywurst and potato pancake appetizers.  The German beer and wine selection is nice to complement the food.  There is even a non-alcoholic malt beverage imported from Germany.  The spaetzle is a must have side as is their take on a side salad.  I usually get the special and am rarely disappointed.  The desserts look amazing but I am always too full.

I ate here tonight with my father, sister and brother-in-law. I was initially put off because when we walked in, it was not crowded at all and yet no one acknowledged us  for about 5 minutes, then it took a while to get seated. Also, the waitress seemed very unfriendly and abrupt. However, once we were seated she was very nice . The food here is really delicious. Their salad is excellent and my dinner was extremely tasty. My sister and I had the roast pork special with a type of homefried potatoes. I don't know what they did to these potatoes but they had some bits of crispy onion and bacon(?) that made bursts of flavor with the buttery taste of the potatoes,so good. My  bro in law had chicken frickasee which he loved and my father had the meatloaf. I tasted my dad's and the meatloaf was great but it had too much red sauce on it and the flavor of bell peppers was too strong. Also, all of the red sauce spilled onto the spaetzle and it kind of ruined the flavor of the noodle/dumplings as they were perfect on their own. My only other complaint is that it was really hot and they have no fans or air conditioning to move the air around so it was hot and stuffy. The food is worth the negative things but hopefully they will read the reviews and make some changes.

GLUTEN FREE German food!!!  I was in the mood for authentic German cuisine and googled "German" in Amherst and found this place.  I called on a whim to see if they would be able to serve us a gf meal (I have Celiac) and was totally surprised when I was told they made special gf dishes, including gf spaetzle and gf potato pancakes.  After we got seated, we had a chance to speak with the husband and wife who are the owners and chef.  They have someone who is gf in their family, so they have started putting gf dishes on the menu, and can create most items gf, since they make everything from scratch.  The chef arrives at 8am to prepare for the 4pm dinner service.  This is as authentic and homemade as it gets!  I had the gf potato pancakes, the gf bratwurst and the gf spaetzle.  Then for dessert, I had their homemade hazelnut ice cream Nutella sundae.  Everything was so delicious.  Plus the chef and owner both stopped at our table to make sure our meal was perfect.  The owner informed me that they are very careful in the kitchen and use separate pots and prep areas for the gf orders.  They have been in business for 3 years and are a real home cooking, family owned business.  You can really taste the love they put into every dish.  Plus the wait staff is extremely friendly.  So happy to find a new gf place to go out to eat.  We will definitely be repeat customers!
Small family restaurant but delicious as delicious can be.... The salad with dinner was AMAZING and the jäger schnitzel was awesome.  The pork was light and perfectly fried, fresh mushrooms in the gravy and the spaetzle was very good and rivaled German food in the motherland. Can't wait to come back here one day.

Almost too authentic. This place is really unassuming. You'll drive right by if you're not sure where it is as it's tucked in a strip plaza on a dumpy section of nf boulevard. You walk in and it's decked out in german fare with German music being streamed in over the internet fright from Munich. Even the proprietor is right from Germany. Now onto the good stuff..the food is excellent and they have a variety of items on the menu from different sausage and schnitzels prepared 4 different ways. Probably the most interesting thing I had was the salad because it is a hodge podge of different German items mixed together. Also, at $5 a huge beer for a German import it can't be beat. No other German place comes close except possibly for Scharf's, but even the Adler gives it a run for the overall #1.

To sum it up, we brought my German mother-in-law to this restaurant and she said that she hadn't had food this close to her grandmother's ever.  We then brought the extended German family and they all raved about it as well... so that's saying something! This restaurant is located in a little plaza next to Classics V but don't let the look of the outside deter you.  The inside is warm and homey.  They serve a selection of German Beers and Wines.  Each time we've been there, we've ordered the same thing- potato pancakes to start, the Bavarian Pork Roast (which comes with a German salad and spaetzle) and Sauerbraten (which comes with red cabbage and and spaetzle). The meats are tender and melt in your mouth, and the accompanying sauces are flavorful and delicious. The apfelstrudel for dessert is divine, if you have room for it!  This is real German food at its finest.  Black Forest Adler is owned by the chef and his wife, and she is always a presence in the dining room to make sure you are enjoying your meal.  I absolutely love this restaurant and hope it stays around for a long time!

Consistently the best food and german beer. I recomend this place up and down. What else can i say really. It doesnt matter what plate you order its always perfect. Then there is the portions!!!! Finally a restraunt in this town knows how to fill a belly. :-) I recomend saving room for desert, the linzer tortes are amazing.

Small family atmosphere...bring the family or friends, order beer and some potato pancakes and enjoy. Friendly, helpful staff. Traditional menu with some great dishes. Think meat and potatoes and roll through the night.
I'm too stuffed to write allot about this great place for German food. The Sauerbraten which comes with red cabbage and and spaetzle was fantastic as were the potato pancakes that I had for the appetizer, which could have been the meal all on their own. A+ for service also. I'd love to write more good things but I'm just too full.
This place was decent. Mediocre food, ambiance was friendly and warm, service was extremely slow. Probably wouldn't go back since the food was nothing to write home about.
I wish I could review the food but unfortunately I didnt get to try it. My husband and I walked in and waited for an awkward few minutes while we were looked at by three separate servers who said nothing and continued to bus tables. I'd have stayed had we at least been greeted but we were so uncomfortable we just left. Won't be making an attempt here again.

This restaurant advertises Authentic German Cuisine and has a German flag hanging outside. They only serve dinner and are closed during the daytime. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by a waitress who sounded like she was F.O.B. from Germany. She seated us right away. The interior design of the resturant is complete with all sorts of  German nick nacks displayed on the walls. It has a cozy-home feeling. The menu was an interesting read, but all the veggies and meats used are listed if you don't know what the German title of the meal means. We started off with the Potato Pancake appetizer with sour cream (other option: applesauce). They served us 3 potato pancakes... I wish they could have given us a bunch more for the $5.80 price. Sorry guys, maybe I just too cheap hahaha. Personally I think this place is kinda pricey, but I guess they need the money for their new business. Anyways, the food here is DELICIOUS!! I ordered the Paprika Schnitzel and my boyfriend ordered the Chicken Cordon Bleu with spaetzle instead of the french fries. Spaetzle, for those who don't know, is German pasta that looks like (to me) like scrambled eggs.. hahaha. It's pretty good though! Our orders also came with a German salad.  The salad is an interesting mix of 3 salads: lettuce & croutons, macaroni & corn, and potato salad. It was funny to have all the flavors in one bowl, but it was yummy! When our food came out, it smelled and looked scrumptious! The waitress made me feel like I was in Germany with her German accent. Ohh, also, all the waiters speak German here and the cook is straight out of Germany! My Paprika Schnitzel was very tasty. The flavor of the peppers had combined with the sauce and made the pork taste amazing! The Chicken Cordon Bleu was also very tasty. My boyfriend however, still favors his aunt's recipe because he grew up with that one. Nothing is better than homemade meals anyway. I wanted to get dessert, but I was definitely too full to eat anymore. I will be coming back here at some point. Dishes range from $11 - 20, so expect your dinner to be a bit pricey, but amazingly delicious!!!! I'll post up the photos of our food. =] You should definately try put this place if you enjoy trying new things, getting exposed to different cultures, and enjoy some German food or perhaps some German beer? lol
Family restaurant atmosphere, friendly and attentive service. Good selection of german beers, food was standard german fare, simple but authentic and delicious.
As the official ambassador of new restaurants to WNY (actually a self-appointed title reminiscent of "Commodore" Vanderbilt, "Colonel" Sanders, or "Captain" L. Ron Hubbard) I felt it was my official duty to grace Black Forest Adler with my presence and sample the fare.  Lets just say I left the Black Forest very full and very happy. This restaurant is a fun new addition to the WNY restaurant scene offering a very traditional take on German food.  I was recommended to the Forest by my Teutonic Legal Assistant who claims it was the closest thing she has ever had to her mother's cuisine at a restaurant.  Her mother (who ferments her own sauerkraut) even went with her and was thrilled with the results.  She claims to be very picky about German restaurants and was not blown away with Prosit (as I was) so I knew going in I was in for a real treat. My dining companions included my girlfriend who hates German food...yeah!...my two best friends and a fellow attorney (also a girlfriend to one of the best friends but now the details are drowning out the review). We started the dinner with the Leberklosse (Liver Dumpling Soup) which I thought was a bit too salty.  The dumpling was very thick and tasty, but overall I prefer the Leberklosse at Ulrich's. Next came the potato pancakes which were good, but a bit blah.  Once again. I think Ulrich's does a way better job as their pancakes are definitely more flavorful and hearty.  As a side note, if you like potato pancakes, the Original House of Pancakes makes very thin and very crispy potato pancakes which are quite amazing. From this point forward the fare becomes excellent and it is clear that the Forest is the best German restaurant in town.  We ordered the Limburger Cheese with Music Appetizer.  While I am too much of a gentleman to describe why they describe this meal as "with music" I certainly understood within hours after enjoying the same.  Limburger is probably the most stinky cheese in existence and it was hilarious to watch the expressions around the table as these Limburger virgins sampled this dish.  It was served with raw vidalia onions and the stench totally overpowered the onions.  While there were many descriptives as for the smell my favorites were an old man's foot and raw a$$.  While this may not be the best descriptive for an appetizer, it was quite enjoyable.  As a caveat, one of my Indian friends at the table decided to manhandle the cheese...while eating with your hands may work with curries, it should be discouraged while handling such potent fare.   The dinners were also quite exciting and the menu was quite broad.  There were four versions of schnizle, three types of wurst, a variety of roasted pork and even a vegetarian option (at a German Restaurant...REALLY??) I ordered the Thuringer Wurst with homemade sauerkraut and spaetzle.  This meal was served  with a complimentary salad which consisted of greens tossed in a mild creamy dressing over German Potato Salad, Macaroni Salad and Corn.  While this was something new and different I did enjoy it thoroughly.  The Thuringer was also quite a treat because it is something you just can not find in these parts.  While initially I would have liked some homemade mustard with the wurst, later research indicated in some regions of Germany any condiments served with this wurst are strictly verboten.  The sausage was flavored very mildly with (I believe) marjoram and hints of caraway...reminiscent of a breakfast sausage only much better.   As for the Spaetzle it deserves its own paragraph.  This was the BEST Spaetzle I have EVER eaten...and I have eaten a lot of Spaetzle.  Frankly, I never even liked Spaetzle that much considering it a cheap substitute for pasta (I am Italian remember).  There was a nice bite to their Spaetzle and it was sauteed in PLENTY of brown butter.  Soooooo delicious and amazing leftover!!! My friends ordered a few sauerbratens and they were the best I have in this region.  While Ulrich's and Prosit's sauerbraten tend to be dry, theirs was moist and delicious.   And did I mention the gravy...oh my!!   My girlfriend ordered a large salad...I love her to death...but seriously with all these great options on the menu...well she does have a great butt.  Of course being that she only ate a salad and it was one of our friend's birthdays, we had to order dessert.  We tried both the Linzer Tort and the Apple Strudle on the suggestion of our super friendly waitress, both of which were wonderful and highly recommended. At this point in the evening we were the L.M.A.'s (ask your favorite waiter what that means) and we knew it was time to go.  However, everyone was very friendly, even the chef and the bartender both took the time to ask us how we enjoyed our meal.  This restaurant has a wonderful family atmosphere and it tastes as if you are eating a homemade meal with cousins Helga and Fritz (see National Lampoon's European Vacation).  Oink Oink my good man!!
Don't get scared by the exterior of the restaurant! The place is very nice inside: hospitable and cozy. Menu gives a good choice of pork and beef as well as German wurst. I went for potato pancakes and they were very good! Definitely would go again!
Consistently the best food and german beer. I recomend this place up and down. What else can i say really. It doesnt matter what plate you order its always perfect. Then there is the portions!!!! Finally a restraunt in this town knows how to fill a belly. :-) I recomend saving room for desert, the linzer tortes are amazing.
VERY pricey &not as authentic as the decor.  Since when are "French fries" an authentic accompaniment to wiener schnitzel?  The sauerbraten was dry w/ little gravy. and was served in thick slices. Authentic sauerbraten is more if a stew with tender moist pieces of beef.  This was. Dry and chewy.  Spaetzel were from the box. Red cabbage from the jar.  Apple strudel was passable. Beer was warm! Don't waste your time or your money.  This place is a rip off!
Small family atmosphere...bring the family or friends, order beer and some potato pancakes and enjoy. Friendly, helpful staff. Traditional menu with some great dishes. Think meat and potatoes and roll through the night.
Had the Bavarian Roast Pork with spaetzle and German salad it was excellent. Very friendly service, food and atmosphere. Recommend
I'm too stuffed to write allot about this great place for German food. The Sauerbraten which comes with red cabbage and and spaetzle was fantastic as were the potato pancakes that I had for the appetizer, which could have been the meal all on their own. A+ for service also. I'd love to write more good things but I'm just too full.
Delicious potato pancakes. We split the chicken cordon bleu and it was a little too crispy, but the service was very friendly.
I wish I could review the food but unfortunately I didnt get to try it. My husband and I walked in and waited for an awkward few minutes while we were looked at by three separate servers who said nothing and continued to bus tables. I'd have stayed had we at least been greeted but we were so uncomfortable we just left. Won't be making an attempt here again.
I have been to Germany many times and this restaurant definitely serves authentic German food; I was very impressed.  It is a bit pricey but a nice way to treat yourself.
This restaurant advertises Authentic German Cuisine and has a German flag hanging outside. They only serve dinner and are closed during the daytime. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by a waitress who sounded like she was F.O.B. from Germany. She seated us right away. The interior design of the resturant is complete with all sorts of  German nick nacks displayed on the walls. It has a cozy-home feeling. The menu was an interesting read, but all the veggies and meats used are listed if you don't know what the German title of the meal means. We started off with the Potato Pancake appetizer with sour cream (other option: applesauce). They served us 3 potato pancakes... I wish they could have given us a bunch more for the $5.80 price. Sorry guys, maybe I just too cheap hahaha. Personally I think this place is kinda pricey, but I guess they need the money for their new business. Anyways, the food here is DELICIOUS!! I ordered the Paprika Schnitzel and my boyfriend ordered the Chicken Cordon Bleu with spaetzle instead of the french fries. Spaetzle, for those who don't know, is German pasta that looks like (to me) like scrambled eggs.. hahaha. It's pretty good though! Our orders also came with a German salad.  The salad is an interesting mix of 3 salads: lettuce & croutons, macaroni & corn, and potato salad. It was funny to have all the flavors in one bowl, but it was yummy! When our food came out, it smelled and looked scrumptious! The waitress made me feel like I was in Germany with her German accent. Ohh, also, all the waiters speak German here and the cook is straight out of Germany! My Paprika Schnitzel was very tasty. The flavor of the peppers had combined with the sauce and made the pork taste amazing! The Chicken Cordon Bleu was also very tasty. My boyfriend however, still favors his aunt's recipe because he grew up with that one. Nothing is better than homemade meals anyway. I wanted to get dessert, but I was definitely too full to eat anymore. I will be coming back here at some point. Dishes range from $11 - 20, so expect your dinner to be a bit pricey, but amazingly delicious!!!! I'll post up the photos of our food. =] You should definately try put this place if you enjoy trying new things, getting exposed to different cultures, and enjoy some German food or perhaps some German beer? lol
Wow! -- a truly German restaurant right here in WNY. The place is spotless and the service is good. (Kudos, server Justin!) I loved the German beer with glasses that matched the brand. The food was good  but very rich (the way German food should be -- the off-the-boat German chef even came out of the kitchen to ask us what we thought about the meal); hence, we ended up taking lots of leftovers home. The "Vegetarische," with egg noodles, cheese, and fried onions tasted from anything we've ever had and the wienerschnitzel was good, too--but a little thicker than the way they make it in Berlin -- maybe to make it more appealing to American tastes? The place was hopping, too, even though it was mid-week. Definitely worth a visit and a return visit. If you're into German food, Black Forest Adler is a good choice.
As the official ambassador of new restaurants to WNY (actually a self-appointed title reminiscent of "Commodore" Vanderbilt, "Colonel" Sanders, or "Captain" L. Ron Hubbard) I felt it was my official duty to grace Black Forest Adler with my presence and sample the fare.  Lets just say I left the Black Forest very full and very happy. This restaurant is a fun new addition to the WNY restaurant scene offering a very traditional take on German food.  I was recommended to the Forest by my Teutonic Legal Assistant who claims it was the closest thing she has ever had to her mother's cuisine at a restaurant.  Her mother (who ferments her own sauerkraut) even went with her and was thrilled with the results.  She claims to be very picky about German restaurants and was not blown away with Prosit (as I was) so I knew going in I was in for a real treat. My dining companions included my girlfriend who hates German food...yeah!...my two best friends and a fellow attorney (also a girlfriend to one of the best friends but now the details are drowning out the review). We started the dinner with the Leberklosse (Liver Dumpling Soup) which I thought was a bit too salty.  The dumpling was very thick and tasty, but overall I prefer the Leberklosse at Ulrich's. Next came the potato pancakes which were good, but a bit blah.  Once again. I think Ulrich's does a way better job as their pancakes are definitely more flavorful and hearty.  As a side note, if you like potato pancakes, the Original House of Pancakes makes very thin and very crispy potato pancakes which are quite amazing. From this point forward the fare becomes excellent and it is clear that the Forest is the best German restaurant in town.  We ordered the Limburger Cheese with Music Appetizer.  While I am too much of a gentleman to describe why they describe this meal as "with music" I certainly understood within hours after enjoying the same.  Limburger is probably the most stinky cheese in existence and it was hilarious to watch the expressions around the table as these Limburger virgins sampled this dish.  It was served with raw vidalia onions and the stench totally overpowered the onions.  While there were many descriptives as for the smell my favorites were an old man's foot and raw a$$.  While this may not be the best descriptive for an appetizer, it was quite enjoyable.  As a caveat, one of my Indian friends at the table decided to manhandle the cheese...while eating with your hands may work with curries, it should be discouraged while handling such potent fare.   The dinners were also quite exciting and the menu was quite broad.  There were four versions of schnizle, three types of wurst, a variety of roasted pork and even a vegetarian option (at a German Restaurant...REALLY??) I ordered the Thuringer Wurst with homemade sauerkraut and spaetzle.  This meal was served  with a complimentary salad which consisted of greens tossed in a mild creamy dressing over German Potato Salad, Macaroni Salad and Corn.  While this was something new and different I did enjoy it thoroughly.  The Thuringer was also quite a treat because it is something you just can not find in these parts.  While initially I would have liked some homemade mustard with the wurst, later research indicated in some regions of Germany any condiments served with this wurst are strictly verboten.  The sausage was flavored very mildly with (I believe) marjoram and hints of caraway...reminiscent of a breakfast sausage only much better.   As for the Spaetzle it deserves its own paragraph.  This was the BEST Spaetzle I have EVER eaten...and I have eaten a lot of Spaetzle.  Frankly, I never even liked Spaetzle that much considering it a cheap substitute for pasta (I am Italian remember).  There was a nice bite to their Spaetzle and it was sauteed in PLENTY of brown butter.  Soooooo delicious and amazing leftover!!! My friends ordered a few sauerbratens and they were the best I have in this region.  While Ulrich's and Prosit's sauerbraten tend to be dry, theirs was moist and delicious.   And did I mention the gravy...oh my!!   My girlfriend ordered a large salad...I love her to death...but seriously with all these great options on the menu...well she does have a great butt.  Of course being that she only ate a salad and it was one of our friend's birthdays, we had to order dessert.  We tried both the Linzer Tort and the Apple Strudle on the suggestion of our super friendly waitress, both of which were wonderful and highly recommended. At this point in the evening we were the L.M.A.'s (ask your favorite waiter what that means) and we knew it was time to go.  However, everyone was very friendly, even the chef and the bartender both took the time to ask us how we enjoyed our meal.  This restaurant has a wonderful family atmosphere and it tastes as if you are eating a homemade meal with cousins Helga and Fritz (see National Lampoon's European Vacation).  Oink Oink my good man!!
While Tammy is cavorting with the Girl Scouts, I was wondering what to do when inspiration was struck by Ron who is vacationing in Bavaria.  So I took a drive for some German food, in my VW Jetta of course. Fahrfunugen! Now I  have a new place to list among my favorites, the Black Forest Adler. Gerhard was a chef in Germany for twenty years before coming to America a couple years ago. His wife Laura is a gracious host. My server Danielle was excellent. Oh, the food? The goulash soup was superb, even though I had no idea what to expect. Their German salad is best described as a vegetarian garbage plate, people know is a passion of mine from my other posts (BTW, I haven't found a place in Buffalo to top Marks in Rochester, but I digress.) The base had German potato salad, macaroni with peas and chick peas, shredded carrots, and a corn and red bean mix. All topped with greens with house dressing. Delicious  The main event was a paprika schnitzel (pepper pork) with spaetzle and I ordered a side of red cabbage. Outrageous! The food and beer selection are German and 5 star. Zehr gut! Worth the drive.
Don't get scared by the exterior of the restaurant! The place is very nice inside: hospitable and cozy. Menu gives a good choice of pork and beef as well as German wurst. I went for potato pancakes and they were very good! Definitely would go again!
VERY pricey &not as authentic as the decor.  Since when are "French fries" an authentic accompaniment to wiener schnitzel?  The sauerbraten was dry w/ little gravy. and was served in thick slices. Authentic sauerbraten is more if a stew with tender moist pieces of beef.  This was. Dry and chewy.  Spaetzel were from the box. Red cabbage from the jar.  Apple strudel was passable. Beer was warm! Don't waste your time or your money.  This place is a rip off!
