Had a Groupon for a mani/pedi at Metamorphose on Central Ave.  It was the best mani/pedi I've had at a salon.  The massage chair was comfortable and the pedi started out with a quiet, relaxing footbath for at least 15 minutes before it was started.  That was lovely!  Jess, the nail tech, was sweet, charming and very good at her job. The salon itself is welcoming, everyone was very friendly.  The decor was calming and relaxing.  The location on Central is a little tough, but it's worth the trip. The massage and haircut prices are competitive and I will definitely be back for those services as well since I've been looking for a new salon.
