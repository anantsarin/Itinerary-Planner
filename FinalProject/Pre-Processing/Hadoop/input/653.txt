Neat store, with a great layout, that sells cute clothes? Sweet. Very helpful and friendly employees? Yes! Took my daughter here earlier, after a terrible experience at another store. Such a breathe of fresh air, as far as shopping for girl's clothes goes. My daughter had browsed the catalog she'd gotten in the mail and knew what she wanted, so we went with a mission. My son hates shopping(he's a boy and a toddler, it's bound to happen) and decided Delia's would be his place of choice for his, "Ihate shopping meltdown". He gets loud and pretty fired up. Â This is when we wrap it up and go. My daughter had about a minute in the shop when my son decided it was go time. Crunched for time, I suggested she ask the girl working the floor if she could help her hunt down what was on her shopping list. The girl who helped her was more than happy to do so and we were at the register within just a couple minutes. Phew! The clothing here is on the trendier side, prices are totally reasonable, they usually have some sort of sale going on, offer a punch card (20 punches, at 10.00 a punch and you get 20.00 off), and as far as I've been told and seen while doing the laundry, the quality of the clothing they sell is pretty good...except some of their graphic tees don't wash and dry so well, I've had them shrink and go uneven. I'd give five stars but the store selection tends to fall short of what the catalog/online shop offers. For example, they have super cute semi formal dresses online and none of them are in this store.
