Found this place open on Columbus Day, during our tour of the fall foliage, when many other places were closed. We shared a veggie burger, hand cut fries and coleslaw. The pattie was excellent, clearly made in house, and with a lovely mix of textures and flavored. The fries were nice and hot, not limp and greasy, and not too crunchy--- just right. The coleslaw was so good I had to get a second helping: fresh, healthy, and a nice mix of tang, crunch, and sweet (but not too sweet). Service was quick and friendly. All in all a very good experience, and I would go there again if I pass through Poughkeepsie.
Not impressed. I got the Thai dog - it wasn't hot - dog was just warm and flavorless. I didn't really get a "Thai" vibe from it- I guess they were trying with the peanut sauce to be like satay sauce or something - but it was really nothing special. Husband got the bacon wrapped dog and again nothing special and underwhelming. Edible at most, but won't be returning.
Used to be my wife's favorite spot for gluten free comfort food.
If you're looking for something different for your dog, this it it! All the different topping suggestions may sound a bit odd, but they are worth it!
Went here for lunch with coworkers and got the veggie dog with quinoa chili and guacamole.  Very good - especially the chili.  Coworkers got hotdogs, Mac and cheese, milkshake and fish tacos - everything was tasty!  Would definitely come back.
Soul Dog is very different on the inside now! Different color scheme and organization, although the menu is quite similar. There is a push to cater to the fad niche of being a "gluten-free" establishment (which is entirely a fad unless you have celiac disease or diagnosed gluten intolerance). My husband, daughter and I had a good time there recently - the food was good. I don't know if it's the new GF buns, but the bottom of the bun got super soggy and unappetizing soon after we were given our hotdogs (and I had 1 tofu dog with kimchi and 1 chicken dog with thai toppings). I was very disappointed in this because I never had this issue before with Soul Dog. Also, the chicken hotdogs are no longer applegate chicken dogs, which are (in my humble opinion), the best out there. They are more sausagey, which still tasted good but wasn't as good as the previous offering. It didn't blend well with the toppings I usually select. The kids' macaroni and cheese was a decent sized portion for my 9 month old daughter and tasted very good. We really enjoyed it - although it seemed a bit small for a 4-6 year old if you were going to order it for your child. (More than enough for a small babe to enjoy). The prices for the special hot dogs add up quick - don't think you will be going to this place and pay less than Palace Diner up the street if you and your dining partner select a few of the special dogs to chow down on. I was very happy that they were catering to us and kind to my daughter - but I have to admit, I kinda miss the old Soul Dog.
This is a great place to stop for a quick lunch. The prices have gone up from the last time we went and some of the menu items were gone. Still pretty good overall.
It's always exciting to find a little joint like this that offers options for vegetarians and gluten-free diners. I was in Poughkeepsie recently visiting my boyfriend so we decided to stop by and try out some veggie dogs. My boyfriend got two veggie dogs with various toppings, one with veggie chili, cheese, and guacamole, and another with jalapenos and cheese. I stuck with a simple dog with mustard, ketchup and relish. The veggie dogs really weren't bad - I'm not sure how they were prepared but I wish they were grilled or had more of a char on the outside to get some texture variations in the dog. Toppings were fine overall, but my boyfriend wasn't so sure about the guacamole, which he said was way too smooth and seemed to come from a tube. I think the roll was my biggest disappointment. It was your standard hot dog roll that you'd find in a bag at the store.  I guess I'm just spoiled by a local hot dog joint up in Rochester called Dogtown that serves up their veggie dogs on a nice crusty French roll. We also tried sides of mac & cheese and soul fries. As other reviewers said, the mac & cheese is pretty tasty, nice and creamy with the little kick of the red pepper flakes on top. The soul fries are garlicky and salty with a hint of rosemary. Super tasty, but I recommend sharing these, as these have a pretty strong flavor that is best in small doses. All in all, Soul Dog is a cool place to grab a quick bite and I appreciate their willingness to cater to different dietary needs. The worker there was very nice and food came out quickly. It's a unique restaurant in Poughkeepsie that I'd be happy to support again. I definitely wish this had been in my college town, and I would probably stop by again if I was in the area!
Another Celiac here, but I forget that when I go to Soul Dog. Yesterday was: - Disco fries: seasoned homemade fries with cheese and gravy Crispy where they should be and soggy where they were covered with ooey gooey cheese and yummy creamy gravy. Love the variety of textures and flavors in this homey comfort food. - crispy fish tacos I've never had crispy fish tacos before because of the gluten issue. Love love love. Lettuce, fresh red onions, cilantro and a tasty house sauce top the extra crispy, flaky white fish, served on a soft corn tortilla. My beloved thought they were a little pricey at about $10 for three, but he forgets that gluten free costs more. - hot dog with cheese and onion sauce A must-have at Soul Dog. The GF roll reminded me of the potato rolls I ate pre-diagnosis. It was soft but strong enough to hold the loaded hot dog. The light grill marks on both the buttered roll and the dog added to the appeal. A generous amount of toppings made it a little messy, which is how a good dog should be. - hush puppies Perfect! Crunchy outside with a soft fluffy inside. They have jalapeños, but I didn't get any heat. The savory is balanced with the sweetness from the accompanying honey mustard. Yum. Hubby also had Mac & cheese -- the gluteny variety. I've had the GF before and it was good. (I didn't get it this time because I'd recently visited S'mac in Manhattan, and as much as I love Soul Dog, there's no comparison. Don't feel bad, Soul Dog -- that's all S'mac does.) For desert, I had a vanilla cupcake with vanilla frosting. It tastes like a gluteny cupcake, and it has sweet, thick butter & sugar frosting. None of that fake whipped non-dairy topping stuff. (Yeah, I'm referring to you, Mozzarelli's.) Can't forget the brewed mint sweet tea. Oh, yeah. It's a little small, so it can get crowded at times. That's okay, though, because it's just more evidence of how good it is. If you have to sit, it's so worth it. Love the staff, too. When I go in, I feel like a kid in a candy store for the first time. Actually, more like a grown woman with an AmEx card in a great shoe store. Going back ASAP. Also trying to figure out how to get takeout when my Albany to NYC train stops in Poughkeepsie. Soul Dog is two blocks from the station...
Being a vegetarian, it's great to find a place that has veggie dogs! There are soooooo many toppings to choose from(My husband really likes to mix and match ( jalepenos, oninos, chili, etc) toppings. I'm a traditionalist so ketchup and mustard are my go to. I'm glad they have vegetarian chili as well! This place is family friendly and they have crayons for kids(This is a great place to bring children after visiting the mid hudson valley children's museum down the street, if you are in the area). They also pride themselves in having many gluten free options, which I know is important to some people. I haven't been here recently only because we've started to buy soy hot dogs at the market and for us eating hot dogs is more for emergencies, travel, camping, etc. We might return if they start adding more veggie items, such as a variety of wraps, soups( I know they have a quinoa chili as well as tomato soup), sandwiches, etc...but I guess that defeats the purpose of being called "Soul Dog"
The NYC area has a ton of hot dog areas that have a whole lot of clout. If you ask me though, the best hot dog around lies outside the reach of NJ Transit, at the end of the Metro North Hudson Line...in Poughkeepsie. I probably went to Soul Dog on a weekly basis in college, and even that was too little. There are countless toppings here that suit a wide variety of tastes -- guac, chili and salsa for those who want a little Mexican, peanut sauce if you want Thai -- and several different sausages to choose from, including chicken and a vegetarian option. They'll usually have a special dog of the day, but my standbys are usually chili, cheddar and guac or chipotle sauce. As for the fries, get the regular ones; the cajun fries are EXTREMELY salty. I know people are very territorial about their dirty water dogs, that nothing can beat the simplicity of a hot dog with a stripe of ketchup, mustard and (if you're a horrible, horrible person) that red onion relish. For those of us with taste buds though, Soul Dog is a MUST.
Well it did not take much convincing beyond our friegasm lunch to know we have it bad for the fries, the Soul Fries, Jamaican Jerk Fries, etc. you have it going on and us addicted to your deliciousnesses. youtube.com/watch?v=6QnG…
I sometimes have to go to Poughkeepsie for my job and when I do,  it's a treat to go here. I have Celiac Disease, which means I can't eat wheat, barley or rye. Finding a place that offers me hot dogs, beer, desserts, etc, that I can actually eat is a thrill.  I went here for the first time a few months ago and was as happy as a pig in, well, you know. I think I even called my boyfriend as soon as I was done to gloat about my fortune. Last week, I had a dog with veggie chili and cheese and the cajun fries. It was delicious, as always, and a good price.  I also had a brownie and some coffee. The time before that, I had tons of saurkraut and mustard, a lemon bar and the soul fries.   Next time I need to try some of the sides and some of the more unusual toppings. This is a great lunch spot with a funky but casual atmosphere. I recommend it to all of the Celiacs I know, not to mention anyone in the Hudson Valley area. What's especially great about their gluten-free baked goods is that they are actually really good  and are comparable to "real" baked goods.
This place it kick-a@% awesome.  Seriously.  My wife and i love it.  It's SUPER affordable and the hotdogs/toppings rule.  They always have a special sausage (type of sausage/topping deal). They name their hotdog/topping combos after famous people like the "Salma Hayek".  We're not gluten-free people, but if you are you're set at this joint. The people are real cool and laid back, the vibe's right on.  The mac and cheese is good, the quinoa chili and quinoa salad is soul satisfying...outstanding. We're total foodies and honestly, 5 stars for a hotdog joint???  It deserves 6 ..Try the spicy peanut sauce and the marsala mushrooms...not on the same hot dog of course :)  peace
Was up in Poughkeepsie visiting the mom-in-law, and we were going to get Vietnamese food when she mentioned a place called Soul Dog. She said it was a hot dog place and I wasn't too excited, but then I saw the menu and all the wonderful things I could put on top of a hot dog. You know when you're looking at a menu, and there's so many options, you get the feeling that no matter how good it is, you'll be just a little disappointed that you didn't get to try everything on it? That's how I felt. That was my nonsensical anxiety before I ordered from Soul Dog and exactly how I felt afterwards. Don't get me wrong, its a great place. But I just can't help but be a little sad that I don't live closer to this fine establishment. (Though my heart is probably thankful.)
Dogs are good, but it's the selection of fresh toppings that makes this place great. Excellent chili, and the jalapenos and sauces are primo. The dogs are boiled, so you don't get that grilled taste some prefer. It's cheap, tasty, and plenty of seating.
I come here for the hot dog toppings: roasted poblano pepper salsa, caramelized onions and lots others. This place is close to work, so it's easy for me to pop by and get a turkey chili dog. Any place named "Soul Dog" has to be good. You always feel the love.
I have to be honest, when I first heard about this place I was a little skeptical. I wasn't sure what I would be walking into. I wasn't sure if it was going to be upscale, a hole in the wall or maybe something in between. Thankfully I was pleasantly surprised when I walked through the door. This place is awesome. The atmosphere/people are friendly and down to earth. A couple of things that really stood out were A - Their napkin and straw holder is a bend up old record and B - they have white paper place mates and crayons on every table so you can doodle while you wait for your food (which does come out in minutes). The music was good and there was no rush to eat and run. The food is also very unique. They have over 15 different toppings that you can have on your hot dog. And speaking of the hot dogs you have the option to get a veggie dog if you don't eat meat. We were going to just get something to snack on, but then after taking one bite we quickly put in another order. We ended up having 1 order of soul mac and cheese fries, jerk fries, hot dog with sour cream and guacamole, hot dog with caramelized onions and Chipotle Cream, and another hot dog with caramelized onions, soul sauce and bacon. Everything was super delicious. My favorite was of course the mac and cheese fries and the hot dog with soul sauce. Everything had a bit of a bite to it - but not to much that you can't handle the heat. They also have dessert - cupcakes and cookies - that are all gluten free. I can't wait to come back here again!!!
I am so surprised to see that this place has any good reviews. I found this place and was so excited to try it out. When I walked in the decor was cute but dirty. There was dead bugs and dust all over the window panels but that's besides the point. I tried the all American hot dog with fries and the gluten free mac & cheese. The hot dog was AWFUL! No exaggeration!! It was warm as if it had been sitting out for awhile. The mac and cheese was even worse. I knew it was microwaved as soon as it was put down on my table. There's no real chef here. There was a young girl in the back making our food which means nothing is fresh but everything has to be microwaved. I was so disgusted I didn't even finish eating anything. I will definitely never come back here again and if you do your only wasting your time & money. What a shame!!
Not super impressed. Sabbrett hotdogs on store bought rolls. They were fine but hardly "gourmet". It's a normal hotdog. The fries were tasty and hand cut. The gluten free chocolate chip cookie was disgusting (and I love gf treats). The tatted up cashier was very unfriendly which is always a bummer. This is an average spot, serving average food. Not rushing back, but would do in a lunch pinch.
You don't know what you can put on a hot dog until you get to Soul Dog.  Then you find out you can put anything on it, and it blows your mind. Soul Dog, you need a NYC location.  I miss the opportunity to have a guacamole-sour cream-cheddar cheese chicken dog, or a beef dog wrapped in bacon.  And soul sauce.  Oh how I miss soul sauce.  And the fries.  Cajun, jamaican jerk, BBQ, soul... they were all perfect.  And how could I forget the mac & cheese? As far as the rest of the menu goes, my friends were fond of the chilis, and the sloppy joes, and the spicy peanut sauce.  The rule of thumb at Soul Dog, though, is that it's all good. The decor is sweet, and the crayons at the tables were a lot of fun.  It's not necessarily the best seating arrangements for larger groups, but there's always the park along the Hudson when the weather's nice!
Based on the reviews i went to soul dog yesterday, and already i'm an addict! the quinoa chili was amazing and as a self-appointed connoisseur of fries... omg choices choices, so many choices :O i had jamaican jerk fries  and loved every last one of em Yum :D i'm just wishing for the day they open a new paltz branch !!!
I stopped in here after getting off the train from Vermont and thoroughly enjoyed my meal. I even went back for seconds. I've never been a huge fan of hot dogs, but this place turned me around completely. The toppings they offer range from your typical chili & cheese to more unique things like salsa and spicy peanut sauce. They've also got a lot of gluten free & vegetarian/vegan options which I love. I highly recommend getting an order of Soul Fries with your dog(s), you won't be disappointed.
I use to not be able to go a week without Soul Dog.  The chicken Thai Dog was my favorite and the mac n cheese was to die for.  Since the business was sold,  my feeling have since changed.  The last time I got the peanut sauce, the cucumbers were the size of what you would put on a salad.  The beef dogs looked different, not sure if they are still using applegate products. The Soul Fries were over cooked and hard.   The atmosphere is blah.  Not sure if they are in a constant make over from the previous owner.   I miss the previous owner.
As a vegetarian, I don't often eat hot dogs, especially at a restaurant.  So, when I heard that there was a place with veggie hot dogs in Poughkeepsie (near where I was vacationing), I was there. Soul Dog is a 30-seat room with a Jamaican twist.  Its brick and plaster, multi-colored walls and wood floors and drinks served in Mason jars give it a happy atmosphere. The food follows the same theme.  Local corn on the cob was creamy and buttery.  Creamy-style coleslaw has a light, spare sauce, not sweet or overpowering to the cabbage.  Macaroni and cheese is deliciously gooey and sprinkled with breadcrumbs.  Iced tea is pleasantly minty. The weak point, strangely enough, was the veggie hot dog, which was OK but could have used a grilled bun.  Perhaps this is why all the exotic toppings exist, although the meat hot dogs are probably better.  Nevertheless, Soul Dog is worth a trip for the Poughkeepsie visitor or resident.
Great place! Yelped from my phone and it was nearby, with great reviews! Now I know why! Such an adorable little place (about 20 seats), with real character and friendly staff. I got the chicken hot dog with guacamole and sour cream, an order of the soul mac and cheese, and an order of the soul fries, and the home-made mint iced tea (complete in the mason jar!) Such good food, and great prices! Also, you're basically guaranteed 5 stars if you have crayons and white paper place-mats on your table (Yes, I'm 23. No, I was not with a child). I'm not a vegan, or even a vegetarian, but I love the options here for people who are. My sister is vegan, and I always love when I can find places where she could eat (Then I call her and rub it in her face because she lives 300 miles away). I definitely can't wait to go back! (Tip: Parking could be tight if it were a busy day in the area, but I had no problem during the week around 1pm.)
I love Soul Dog.  The only thing that keeps me away is the parking. I'm pretty much a meat-and-potatoes guy but even I will get a Chicken dog here, because the toppings make it great.  The fries are great too.  Real, with the skin on, fries.  None of that 'coated' or 'seasoned' crap that most places serve nowadays.  I'm not huge on the cajun fries but the rest are great. Try the spicy peanut sauce (with scallions) on a chicken dog; it's really good. This was nearly a 5 star review, because there's really nothing they do wrong here.  Consider it 4.5 stars.  It lost a little due to the prices (after you add on fries and a drink that 2 hot dog lunch comes out over $11) and the parking (which is not Soul Dog's fault; it's just a busy area of downtown po-town.  If you are lucky, you'll get a spot right on this block.  But, at lunchtime during the week, you won't often be lucky.  If you try to go around the corner, you'll find that the town has put restrictions on parking, you have to be a resident to park there!  How stupid! I'd be pretty mad if I was a local business owner. Anyway, try Soul Dog; you can't really go wrong. Read my profile for more about how I rank restaurants. I consider this a 2.5 to 3 star establishment.
Coming from a Gluten Free perspective, I was not super impressed by Soul Dog.  What I've realized is that people who are Gluten Free really should eliminate many carbs as well.  All blood type 0's need to avoid wheat (please remember this, as I've randomly asked blood type 0's about wheat and they all seem to find it disagreeable to one degree or another). I think Soul Dog food is good for comfort food.. I just wouldn't chow down on it or any Gluten substitute food because of all the extra ingredients one needs to add to make the darn thing take good AND be gluten free. Gluten Free people need to concentrate on health and eating SOUL DOG food is not the best place for this in my opinion..  Why be Gluten Free and loaded with things that aren't the greatest for your health? Sorry for the rant.  The food is above average I'd say, so for most people who can eat Gluten this is a good place..  The environment is cool and fun.  It's inviting and was really busy when I went.  Poughkeepsie and even the whole area definitely needed a fast dog place.
The have changed hands and I can NOT recommend the new hot dogs. I ordered 2 chicken dogs, which was my usual order, but I could only choke down one of them. The skin was tough and I could taste filler--I know it wasn't actually sawdust, but it sure tasted like it. Sad to see this lunchtime treat go down the tubes like this
It seemed very very strange that Poughkeepsie would have a cafe that catered gluten-free items on their menu, but I was very pleasantly surprised at how great this place is! Very small, but with a funky interior and friendly staff - definitely a popular place for college kids since its such a reasonable place to eat, and so much fun too! Three different hot dogs (beef, chicken, soy) and  HUGE list of toppings to pick and choose from. You could spend so much time coming up with different and yummy combinations. I'm not a hot dog fan, but I have to say that I really enjoyed my meal there. The vegetarian chili is AMAZING, and the gluten-free baked goods are also quite tasty. Definitely worth a visit - or more.
Best hot dogs... hands down. I lived in Poughkeepsie on and off for four years as a Marist student and I can't believe I only started coming here as a senior. Whenever I go back to visit, I make sure Soul Dog is on my list of places to eat at. There are a ton of great toppings to choose from for your hot dog... my favorites are guacamole, sour cream, caramelized onions and Soul Sauce. Not only are their hot dogs amazing, but they have great sides too. Some of my personal favorites are their hush puppies, fried pickles and various seasoned fries. Service is speedy and the staff is always friendly. There's limited seating, but I always go with a decent-sized group and we always manage to squeeze in. Also, there's extra seating outside when the weather's nice. While you're waiting for your food, feel free to grab some crayons on the table and draw on your placemats! Can you tell I always do that?
I want a Soul Dog around the corner from where I live.  We read about this place in a local paper that did a roundup of best local eats while we were on a short vacation out that way, and the detour on the way home to Boston was worth it!  I've often contemplated just driving out that way for the day, to hike and get a dog (if only gas was cheaper right now...). The selection of dogs is amazingly diverse: veggie, beef, chicken, plus their homemade sausage of the day.  I had 2 hot dogs, and I probably could've done a third (goodness knows I *wanted* to so bad), but the space was deservedly given to the fantastic jalapeno hush puppies+honey mustard sauce and fries instead.  Their sloppy joe topping, as well as their homemade Soul Sauce, are tasty separately and together, the caramelized onions will make any cooked onion fan smile, and the guacamole was lovely.  I was curious about the gluten-free bun, and I'm glad I tried it.  I don't know what other gluten-free things are like yet, but I can tell you that the bun was good, it held together nicely, and didn't crumble the way I've been told other GF breads do. This place blows Spike's out of the water, but with a similarly casual experience.  If you're in the neighborhood, and you like hot dogs, definitely stop by!
While exploring Poughkeepsie one weekend, we needed a little something to tide us over to make it through the afternoon without killing our appetites for dinner later and seeing that they had veggie dogs and chicken dogs, I thought this would be perfect. Soul Dog was super cute inside and I was excited about the idea of the wacky toppings. The staff were quite friendly and fast, the clientele was pretty chill. I ordered a veggie dog with guacamole and chipotle cream, my bf got a veggie dog with vegan chili. He was quite pleased with his. I sampled his chili and it was good. Mine was just flavorless - the guacamole just looked like pureed avocado with nooooooothing else in it and the chipotle cream had little more mystique than mayonnaise - plus there was so much of both and they were super runny so it was just everywhere. We both got a side of quinoa salad which was basically just quinoa with a lot of garlic, a huge portion at that. Just meh. We were both still hungry after this - I got a chicken dog with the chili and it was okay, the chicken dog had little more flavor than the tofu dog from the first round. I felt like I was doing something wrong but I just wasn't feeling this place. I really wanted to like it, but it was like a limp handshake. I wish I was eating mac and cheese, fries and beef dogs, alas I am not, so I guess I get the short end of the Soul Dog schtick.
I went to Marist and during my time there this was pretty much a weekly stop.  A bunch of friends & I would all get together and head there.  Most menu items are gluten free.  The Mac & Cheese is super tasty, especially with the seasoning on top. (I always asked for extra.) Get the Soul Fries! You won't regret it. I also like that they always have different art work hung on their walls and it's usually for sale. Keeping the place constantly changing was another good reason to stop in.
It's pretty good here. Excellent prices with the good ole' hot dog. I ordered 3 hot dogs. 1 chili and cheese, 1 cole slaw and bacon, and lastly 1 cole slaw and soul sauce. They were all fairly good. The chili had beans in it, i'm not a fan of beans in my chili, but the combination of chili and cheese was good. Then there was the cole slaw and bacon, my personal favorite. It was the perfect balance of sweet salty and mayonnaisey. The slaw was a very nice contrast with the dog and I was pleased with the crunch of the bacon...MMM. Then lastly, my cole slaw and soul sauce dog. It was nice, the soul sauce was slightly spicy and a bit sweet. That sauce was very very good. My only thing is, these dogs have no snap. I've heard the sausage had a snap..too bad I didn't order that.
In the mood to dine out but don't know where to go?  Craving casual and healthy food?  Then it's settled, go here. This is where I go when I don't want to spend a fortune but still eat my fill.  I have my favorites on the menu but am usually pleasantly surprised when I sample what my friends are having.  Love it when you have too many toppings to choose from.  Can't beat the prices and I like the health conscious but not obnoxious, bohemian atmosphere.  You can have your gluten free cake and eat it too!
I decided to check this place out because I had some vegan friends come into town and I wanted a place we could all enjoy.. i had the italian sausage and found the bread to be too soggy after ordering it with carmelized onions.. it was good but messy, so I'd suggest using something other than a generic hot dog roll for toppings.. all in all a great place.. for meat eaters and non meat eaters alike! I've got to come back for more fries..
I was on the second day of a NYC - Montreal bike trip when when I stopped in Poughkeepsie for an iced coffee and a bite to eat.  Located on what seemed to be a main drag, I initially thought that I was walking into a "Salty Dog" cafe, like the famous one on Hilton Head.  Instead I found that this was a hot dog joint, whatevs, I was mostly here for the coffee. I ordered up an iced coffee which was average sized, tasty enough, and came in a mason jar.  For eats I took a side of their quinoa salad ( about $3) and scarfed it down.  It's important to keep up caloric intake on multi-day rides, and after finishing everything I wasn't quite ready to hop back on my bike just yet, so fuggit, I'll get the nachos. They were cheap at less than $8 (maybe even $6.50?) and were totally customizable just like their hot dogs, the portion was huge (as all nacho meals should be) and I shamelessly demolished it while onlookers tried not to stare.  Come to think of it, I think a few people took note and ordered their own. I have no idea if I'll ever be in Poughkeepsie again, if I am I'll probably stop back in for the hot dog and fries, if not.  Well soul dog, we'll always have the memories.
I first heard about this place from a friend of mine who has to eat gluten-free, and the menu looked so amazing I couldn't pass it up. I wish I lived closer to Soul Dog...thinking about it, I may have to go there this weekend. I have actually only been there once, and I was hung over and my girlfriend and I were waiting for two friends of ours to show up so we could all eat together. We spent about thirty minutes drawing on our placemats with crayons, reading local magazines, and cursing our friends for their tardiness. By the time they showed up, I'd already drawn cartoons of their gravestones, and was starving. But it was so worth it. All kinds of hot dogs and sausages, all reasonably priced, and with ridiculous toppings to add on - I was a big fan of chili with guacamole and sour cream, So good. So good. Also, yes, the fries and hush puppies are pretty terrific.
I had a mind-blowing experience yesterday with a combination of foods that should never have worked together.   When my boss, Allen, told me yesterday that he was thinking of going out for hot dogs I assumed we were just going to have hot dogs. I had no idea that it was going to be an experience. After trudging through puddles and piles of snow we made it to Soul Dog, a small cafe on Main Street in Poughkeepsie - just two blocks from the train station. Soul Dog serves Sabrett hot dogs, chicken dogs, veggie dogs and sausages. I like a Sabrett hot dog - but what makes Soul Dog special is that they don't just grill the dog - they offer some wild toppings. As soon as I say that they offered bacon as a topping, I knew this was something I would like. (Other options include: baked beans, sloppy joe, marsala mushrooms, guacamole, peanut sauce and chipotle cream among others) Having never been there before, I asked Allen what we should order. Of course we would get a hot dog but he suggested that we share side orders of fires, and mac and cheese. Perfect. When it was our turn to order we were told about the specials of the day. They had, and I am not kidding you, french fries topped with chili AND macaroni and cheese.What?! So wrong. And you know that we had to have it. So - I had a dog topped with mustard and caramelized onions; Allen had one with mustard and sauerkraut; and we shared an order of the chili and mac and cheese topped fries. When this pile of potatoes, cheese, macaroni, meat and beans was put on our table all I could say was "oh, that's not right". It was though, it was so right. I almost can't describe it. The fries had a really good crunch and held up well under the toppings. They had a good amount of black pepper on them giving just a little heat. The mac and cheese was creamy. The chili was thick and hearty. You want to talk about food porn - this was like some weird fettish stuff. Something you didn't mean to see, but can't turn your eyes away from. Something weird and ugly but strangely sexy.  So wrong, but oh so right.
Awesome place first time i got a chicken dog that was delicious & soul fries the second time i had the veggie dog w/turkey chili & mac & cheese. the soul fries have a nice after taste w/the lingering flavor of the seasonings the mac in the mac & cheese was cooked just right. Last time i was there our drinks came in mason jars (reminded me of my mom). The place has a great friendly atmosphere & the staff is very friendly (the lady there was nice enough to cure my hiccups). They have veggie options & gluten free!
It's like a dog cart without the cart. Everything was freshly made, like the cole slaw. Dogs were good. My tomato soup was excellent. Little crowded at lunchtime with "regulars". Waitstaff was polite and efficient.
Stopped in for a quick two dog lunch and a cold beer. Had the Sloppy Joe dog & washed it all down with a Brooklyn Larger...very good. Very nice staff as well.
Afforable and tasty, just do it. Funky atmosphere, nice people, interesting menu.
I thought that my experience 6 months or so ago was a blip in the transition from owner to another.  Today's shared dinner of fried chicken that was cold in the middle, corn bread that tastes just like the kind I can make at home myself, and bland nachos indicates that we've lost a GF option in Poughkeepsie for our family.  Even the cheesecake was dry and tasted funky..
I get back to this after I eat. Well, it was great and the owner was hear working, very pleasant and the fries are as good as all the reviews said. Carrot cake is the bomb. If I lived nearby I'd come in every week. Jeff
I was so excited to eat here, hearing they had Paleo options. Sometimes we just don't have time to cook or are just out and about. First, parking is VERY limited, on main street, especially at the busiest times of the day, you will most likely be walking here. As for the food, the idea of a lettuce wrapped, natural hot dog is great conceptually, but it was hard and cold inside the lettuce with one piece of bacon half wrapped around it. It gave me a terrible stomach ache and felt like I had just eaten a brick. Also, we ordered the house made unsweetened iced tea and it was served in tiny plastic disposable cups for the same price you would receive a regular 16oz drink at another establishment. Very disappointing. The disco fries were maybe hand cut, but you could not taste the difference because they were covered in two different "sauces" that we assumed were supposed to be gravy and some sort of cheese, however, we could not tell which was which. They both looked and tasted like they came out of a spray can. Gross. The Gluten free Mac and Cheese was mushy and super bland. It did not taste like cheese at all. Unfortunately, we will not be visiting Soul Dog again. I have heard fantastic things about this restaurant from before it switched owners and I wish I had visited it then to get a true taste of the real Soul Dog. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for gluten free or paleo options.
Whenever I'm in Poughkeepsie I eat here. To say I love soul dog wouldn't be enough... It's my favorite place to eat in Poughkeepsie. I think I've perfected my order: generally 2 tofu dogs - 1 with quinoa chili, quac and cheese, the other with spicy peanut sauce, soul sauce, and jalapeños and an order of soul fries. The flavor combinations are out of this world, and I literally can not recommend this place enough.   my only caveat - sometimes the buns get a bit weighed down with all the toppings and require you to knife and fork it. Oh well.
The dogs are good and well priced.  They need to put more of their sauce on the dogs. That would improve it. It's not a bad place in terms of food. Low rating based on the cashier knowingly slipping me a bad bill tucked in between good ones. Didn't notice til I got home. So my food cost me 10 extra actually.
I was in Poughkeepsie for the day and found this place online. Their menu has something for everyone..vegetarians and vegans,gluten free options, and meat options.  I got two veggie dogs (vegan) with the vegan chili on top, an order of the BBQ seasoned fries and a Snapple for eleven bucks which is super cheap for the amount of food I got. Everything was awesome. I will definitely be visiting again!
Jesus is alive and well, and he's taken the form of Soul Dog's BBQ french fries.
What is good for the soul?  Thats right Soul Dog, this is a great little place at the lower end of Main Street with outside seating available for people watching while you dine and a relaxed atmosphere for those who choose to sit inside.  They offer nothing but Good Food here and the Jamaican Jerk Fries are loaded with all the right spices and I would have to say my favorite on the menu.  I have had the pleasure of eating here on several occasions and you can tell that they are passionate about the way they prepare their food as it is always spot on and made with love.
Loved the hot dog with gluten free bun. It was delicious. So nice to have bun with my dog. And the gf Mac n cheese was great too! My hubby loved it even more than I did and he doesn't have to eat gluten free. Can't wait to go back.
Cool little eatery on Main St. in Po-Town.  The layout and design of this place is pretty cool.  Most of the toppings on the menu don't strike you as something you'd enjoy on a hot dog but it's an interesting selection none the less. DD had the grilled cheese, it came out looking a little over cooked (bread was mostly black) but it didn't taste burnt so I'm not sure if this is something with the bread they use.  DW went with the Sloppy Joe, the ground turkey let her feel as if she was eating healthy and the roll they use was really tasty.  Feeling bad that we came to Soul "Dog" and nobody else in my fam was eating Hot Dogs, I went with 2 Sabretts with cheese.  I was expecting shredded cheese but instead there was a massive gob of melted cheese on each of my dogs.  They still tasted good, it just wasn't what I was expecting.  At least I know for next time.  We all shared a fries with Jamaican Jerk spice which were excellent.  The fries are hand made and probably the best thing we had.  DW and DD shared an Ice Tea and I had a Brooklyn Beer.  I like the fact that they serve beer, although the selection could be a little better.  Your only choice is a Brooklyn Pennant Ale, I get the baseball and Hot Dog tie in but a couple of more types of beer wouldn't kill ya.... All that said, we'd hit it up again.  Poughkeepsie seems like it's going through a renaissance and there are plenty of new eateries cropping up.
When I lived in Poughkeepsie, this was THE place to take out of town guests. I would describe it to them as a "gourmet" hot dog joint. It's been great to see this place grow, and it's run by a lovely family and kind staff. My favorite is a dog with Soul sauce and carmelized onions. Also of note is the mac and cheese, hush puppies when you can catch them, and the fries. Whenever my brother--who lives in Brooklyn and has Celiac Disease--comes up, we have to stop in. Glad to see them getting so much support, and Poughkeepsie needs more places like this!
So I have Celiacs but my Fiancee doesn't...we LOVE THIS PLACE.  I told him I was leaving him to move up here to come here all the time, he said can I come too lol.  The fries are to DIE FOR!  Best fries ever.  I spend $80 there this week while I was in town for work.  Thats how much we like it here.  GF Chicken dog with baked beans with cheese and jalapeño hmmm, hush puppies were amazing, we actually just got 2 batches to go :)  and I bought so much sugary goodness i may gain 10 pounds.  We go camping up state about an 45 mins away so we will def be making a trip up a few times this summer!  GET FRIES!  And create yourself an amazing Hot Dog,  don't be dull and boring live a little!!!  You will not be sorry!!!!
I wasn't impressed with the food here.  They managed to turn a high quality dog (Sabrett's!) into a tasteless thing.  The quinoa chili was dubious (and visually unappealing, as it had these little curly things that looked like worms). To put this in perspective:  I'm fine with the idea of gourmet toppings on hot dogs.  But the hot dog has to hold its own.  Whatever they did to the poor Sabrett's dogs (boiled them too long, I think) completely killed their flavor.   I'll give them the benefit of the doubt:  they might have had a off day.  But ultimately...it's a hot dog.  As the old saw goes, you can't make a silk purse from a sow's ear (though you are allowed to make hot dogs from them).
After hearing great things about this place, we finally went there one day.I still fail to understand what the hype is about.Food is bland and boring.Its just a hot dog after all.Tried their veggie hot dog and was absolutely tasteless.Stay away
I went to school in the area and my friends and I went whenever we were in the mood for a great hot dog and some great fries. The fries are seasoned and the hot dogs come with any topping. Seems like it doesn't fit in poughkeepsie, rather the west village in NYC. Great place to try out.
A great place for a cheap bite for carnivores, vegans, and celiacs alike.
Fun and casual, great creations and cheap, too!
Great dogs, cajun fries were awesome and the fresh brewed mint ice tea washed it all down nicely.  Cool little place!
Food was ok - fries were great. However, I hurled later. Maybe it was the peanut sauce or raw jalapenos... Not sure. Caution.
Soul Dog has put the common Hot Dog back on the map.  It's a fun location, clean, simple, and worth every nickel.  It's in my neighborhood, and definitely makes a great addition to the downtown.  Check out their catering options too!
This charming little eatery offers something for all diets. The vegan-friendly menu boasts exotic beef/chicken/veggie dog toppings, including a spicy "Soul Sauce." A chosen "Dog of the Week" goes on the board to boast the most pleasing combos. Soul Dog has more than just hot dogs--you'll be soul-ed with one bite of Soul Dog's vegetarian chili accompanied by a side of sweet potato fries.
I actually know the owners, their son used to go to school with me. Anyway, the hot dogs are good here. They have an impressive array of toppings, but I chose the good old sauerkraut and mustrard. I haven't been there in a while but I've heard the fries are good. A nice clean spot with good food for the family!
The food is less than average and it is really expensive. They are also barely open, I think 3 afternoons a week now. Really don't recommend at all. By the way, if you suggest that $18 for fish tacos and sweet potato fries seems like a lot, they will snicker at you as you turn around to find a table.
This place is a wonderful spot for people on a gluten-free diet who are often so limited on their choices when eating out.  The food is excellent!  We have started to buy their bread weekly as well.  Very clean, friendly and they even have gluten-free beer!!  Soul Dog is also delicious for those who eat gluten - so it really is a perfect spot.
Its okay but not as good as it was in the past.   The chipotle cream is nothing more than mayonnaise....it used to have a nice spicy kick to it.   I swore I would never go back when I got a very stale hot dog bun one time.    To me, the best thing on the menu is the vegetarian chili...slightly sweet and nicely spicy.   Desserts are good here too.
First time eating here. My daughter is gluten-free and had the mac and cheese and also order the sweet potato fries with jerk rub (great combo). I had the Nachos...the black bean and corn salsa was amazing!!!!! Can wait to go back and try new things. Price was good, parking was eh!
While I've heard "Soul Dog" mentioned before in the hinterlands of Hudson Valley, I'd never tried it until this weekend. Some tried and true fans took me to this hot dog haven because they serve veggie dogs along with their chicken, turkey, and beef franks. Well, I agree that it's the best place in town to get a dog and chili, but how many hot-doggeries are there in Poughkeepsie? The joint is small-ish and not fancy, but comfortable. While it was good, with lots of combinations to choose from, it was nothing to write home about. Now, having said that - remember: I had the VEGGIE dogs. Those soy-based suckers can only retain so much taste. My wiener-eating colleagues were quite happily devouring their authentic meat links, topped with everything from sauerkraut and spicy mustard to baked beans and guacamole. A place like this needs a little something to stand out, and Soul Dog has the Soul Fries: thick cut French fries with salt and pepper cooked into them! While they need a bit more of a beer selection, I applaud them on trying to offer alternative brews, not to mention desserts, that are gluten-free fare. (Story has it, their youngest child is allergic to wheat and they could never find any food choices at local restaurants, so they just started making it themselves.) Bravo!
Yummy and cheap food. The soul fries are fantastic and so is just about everything, though I think they need to toast their buns or invest in something a little sturdier since the ones they have sort of dissolve under the heat. My friends and I experienced this burping phenomenon for the rest of the day after eating there, which we call "soul burps." Fun little place, they feed you good food fast, and great for a hang over I'm sure.
(04/28/2012)  Quaint, eclectic, cafe serving up hot dogs (and more!) down by the river.  It's a little less traveled, same could be said for the menu.  All sorts of interesting things to be had on a dog.  Place is vegan, veg and celiac friendly.  Beef hot dogs were thin in girth, but beefy.  Beforewarned, the more toppings, the faster the rate of decline of structural integrity.  I felt like I got my dog pretty fast, and wolfed it down, but still had to do some maneuvering towards the last two bites to save myself from just cupping the whole mess in my palm and lapping it up.  The Soul Sauce was an interesting corn salsa (corn!) with a medium heat.  Quinoa Chili was tomato-ey and a touch sweet.  The Soul Fries are the perfect specimen of a handcut fry; crisp, fluffy on the inside, earthy, roasted bits of potato skin on the edges (the Cajun seasoning was spicy and salty).  The Quinoa Salad (with broccoli and scallions with lemon vinaigrette) was tart, slightly overdressed, somewhat "wet", but a nice way to cut the fat of a hot dog and fries meal.  While not necessarily the best dog I've ever had, they're doing something different and something good here.
I tried this place back in September. I heard a lot of hype, via word-of-mouth and positive reviews on Yelp upon fact-checking the word-of-mouth. I wanted to try it out. I was unimpressed. I do think the amount of toppings offered is impressive, I will give Soul Dog credit for the sheer amount of interesting flavor possibilities to top ones hot dog with. That factor alone will win this place a 3 star review from me. I also liked the look of the place itself, it was kind of cool (inarticulate, but thats the description that comes to mind). However, I do not think the toppings make up for the fact that the buns suck (taste like supermarket buns that become gummy when you chew on them), and the hot dogs are generic brand hot dogs that aren't anything special (amazing??? Really??). The toppings really make the hot dogs in the case of Soul Dog. This is not a hot dog stand, and I think at least the buns should have been of elevated quality. I think having a interesting homemade sausage/hot dog option on the menu (for a higher fair cost of course) as well as the cheaper generic brand option would have made this a 4-5 star review. I spent over 3 dollars on one crappy hot dog with a couple toppings, I didn't feel great about this purchase. I would have spent 5$ for a awesome unique hot dog/sausage  with a good quality bun and felt satisfied.
It's pretty good here. Excellent prices with the good ole' hot dog. I ordered 3 hot dogs. 1 chili and cheese, 1 cole slaw and bacon, and lastly 1 cole slaw and soul sauce. They were all fairly good. The chili had beans in it, i'm not a fan of beans in my chili, but the combination of chili and cheese was good. Then there was the cole slaw and bacon, my personal favorite. It was the perfect balance of sweet salty and mayonnaisey. The slaw was a very nice contrast with the dog and I was pleased with the crunch of the bacon...MMM. Then lastly, my cole slaw and soul sauce dog. It was nice, the soul sauce was slightly spicy and a bit sweet. That sauce was very very good. My only thing is, these dogs have no snap. I've heard the sausage had a snap..too bad I didn't order that.
I decided to check this place out because I had some vegan friends come into town and I wanted a place we could all enjoy.. i had the italian sausage and found the bread to be too soggy after ordering it with carmelized onions.. it was good but messy, so I'd suggest using something other than a generic hot dog roll for toppings.. all in all a great place.. for meat eaters and non meat eaters alike! I've got to come back for more fries..
I first heard about this place from a friend of mine who has to eat gluten-free, and the menu looked so amazing I couldn't pass it up. I wish I lived closer to Soul Dog...thinking about it, I may have to go there this weekend. I have actually only been there once, and I was hung over and my girlfriend and I were waiting for two friends of ours to show up so we could all eat together. We spent about thirty minutes drawing on our placemats with crayons, reading local magazines, and cursing our friends for their tardiness. By the time they showed up, I'd already drawn cartoons of their gravestones, and was starving. But it was so worth it. All kinds of hot dogs and sausages, all reasonably priced, and with ridiculous toppings to add on - I was a big fan of chili with guacamole and sour cream, So good. So good. Also, yes, the fries and hush puppies are pretty terrific.
It's like a dog cart without the cart. Everything was freshly made, like the cole slaw. Dogs were good. My tomato soup was excellent. Little crowded at lunchtime with "regulars". Waitstaff was polite and efficient.
Afforable and tasty, just do it. Funky atmosphere, nice people, interesting menu.
