Ultra nice place to hang with a good smoke.
if you like cigars, big stuffy chairs, and a nice bartender, come here and spend several hours in the middle of the day, like I am/did. just expect to smell like an ashtray when you are done! good selection of scotch and bourbon. *hiccup*
loved it!! This place was so much fun =)
One of the better places to hang. I love the beer and cigar selection. The crowd is great as long as the flip flop wearing losers stay away. Bartenders are good and everyone is friendly.
Great service and selection of cigars and beverages.  They will also order food from local restaurants for you.  Thanks !
Great place. Staff is knowledgeable and always courteous and very helpful. Good selection of Cigars. The best is chilling in the leather seats with a good cigar and listening to live music.
My Rocky Patel cigars are here!
I LOVE this place. Great vibe, big, comfortable chairs, I can smoke there (inside!) a big, extensive cocktail list, excellent staff and free wifi. What's not to love?
Randy is now running the place with class.  What a change!  Great new servers, and the personal touch that you can only get when the Manager personally checks on you and your guests.  Can't wait to come back again.
This is one of the best cigar bars in Florida! They have a huge selection Tatuaje Casa Fernandez, Casa Magna, Craft Beers. And there is always something going on, if you find yourself in Fort Myers you have to check this place out. Ask for Randy the bar manager or Brook the GM and tell them that Pete Hernandez sent you!
