New Paltz. Seriously, never heard of this place. I was traveling to Montreal and wanted a place to stop along the way. Sadly, my timing was pretty bad and I was stuck with choices that were pretty dismal. Apparently New Paltz harbors  some kind of distinguished institution or something because staying at fairly dumpy motels, in the middle of nowhere, ain't cheap. Stopped at one place after calling a few places in the area. All the rates seem to be well coordinated and most of the recognizable chains are within a few bucks of each other. Not being all that excited about dropping $80+ dollars on a mediocre room and having to carry a lot of gear up some stairs (apparently ADA requirements don't apply to upstate New York motels). So I searched harder and found the 87 Motel. Well, I actually saw when exiting freeway to look at the motel I was considering and while I was intrigued but the Bates Motelness of the place (as another writer here so aptly put it) I didn't feel like I was up for a struggle. So I came back anyway. The room rate was cheaper than anyone with a good distance $60. Which was probably too high for this room but it wasn't horrible. Make no mistake, you've got to have a fairly high adventure quotient to like this place. While it's not dirty, it is old, unkempt, not updated, and little freaky. The front desk staff was very nice. The night I was there I was the only paying guest who "wasn't a monthly". The "monthly" folks, there were a few in evidence, looked as though they might be making up a nice batch of meth or something. Now I'm a live and let live guy so I ignored it and enjoyed my room. Decent TV service. There's a brilliant pizza place less than a mile away (Rino's). Really great pizza Italian. The sheets and blankets were clean. No visible bugs (and yes, I'm one of those people who check). The heater worked well enough. The sad thing is, in a town where, once again, apparently, fairly high room rates are achievable a lot, the owners of the 87 have decided to milk this property for all its worth and not update, improve or fix anything. That's a shame because they have nice working there, a great location and they could really, with a small investment, make the place a cool, retro motel. But they don't. In the end, if, like me, you need to find a place to sleep in the middle of nowhere and you've got just a little sense of adventure in you, try the 87. Otherwise, just the extra premium and slog up the stairs in one the dumpy chains that also has properties in town.

The 87 Motel is conveniently located off exit 18 of the NYS Thruway, thus perfect for anyone looking to visit the charming little town of New Paltz, NY.  The entrance is a little tricky; it is connected to a Mobil gas station, but otherwise very easy to find. As I pulled in to the motel, I felt like I was pulling in to the Bates Motel.  The sign is partially damaged and the building closest to Main Street is completely delapadated and boarded up.  My parents had already checked in to the room we were staying in for the evening (we were visiting for my brother's graduation from SUNY) and cynically presented the old-fashioned key that easily could be duplicated as the means of entering our room.  Awesome. The motel is fairly honest in their photos on the website.  The decor is extremely old-school and does not match.  However,  the photos are also a little outdated and the rooms now look a little more worn in.  There is a musky aroma to come along with the room and if you are lucky, a few extra hairs will come with the shower...my family got lucky!  The beds are uncomfortably soft. On the plus side, the rooms include free wi-fi (if that's your deal, it's not mine but my brother was pumped that it worked fairly well) and breakfast.  The breakfast was a small collection of the worst store bought bagels ever and freshly brewed coffee.  It was something to have on a hectic morning so no one can complain about that. Room prices for graduation weekend were around $140 I believe, which is a bargain in mind considering the time of year but bit overpriced for what you actually receive.

bed bugs! stay away! seriously!

This motel is pretty run down, and was a bit expensive. There are really only two motels in town though, so that's the way it goes. Be prepared for an outdated, 70's motel that hasn't been upgraded since it was built. There is wi-fi, and it does work. The shower had water pressure that made soap unnecessary; it blasted our skin off. Each room has an actual key (first time in my life I ever got one of those to enter a hotel room), and the beds aren't all that great. Still, if you need a place to stay and you're exhausted this one won't disappoint. It was a bed, the first night in a long road trip vacation and it did the job.
Omg, worst motel experience of my life! Absolutely disgusting rooms - bugs, dirty towels and sheets, and the window didn't even lock. So sleeved out and gross- I barely slept at all. Management is also so rude unprofessional and worst customer service ever. Don't ever stay here!!!

The place is a little run down, but it's not terrible. Decor is outdated. Towels are softer than other hotels at or around this price level. The bed is a little springy. AC cools off the room almost immediately, after you turn it on. TV is old tube type and small. I've stayed in multiple rooms here before, and things do not match from room to room, it's pretty odd. Kind of comical.

We were hiking at the Mohonk Mountain House until pretty late. Our car wouldn't start and we had to be towed into town. The driver dropped us off at the Super 8 and left. The Super 8 didn't have a non-smoking room for us so we walked to the 87 Motel. I wasn't expecting the Ritz, but, whoa! The front desk reminded me of every movie and tv show I've ever seen where the private "I" has to chase the perp down into a flop house. Well, I get that impression every time I don't check into the Ritz. On closer inspection, the lobby looked clean and pleasant enough. There were pots for fresh coffee and tables and such. One table had the remains of dinner that the monthly guest had left. The monthly guest was still sitting in the lobby but he spoke to us and was nice and not too creepy. The guy at the desk was nice too...even though it was late and we were so tired. He was very pleasant toward us and tried to make us feel comfortable. I think he could see me looking around at everything. I asked him why there were so many photos of geese all over and he said that the geese hang out around there. The monthly guest added that they often tap on the windows to get you to come out and feed them something....awwww! He gave me the key (yes, key) and directed us around the corner to the room. It was about what you would expect from such an old and unimproved motel. I've stayed in worse though. The lock was on the doorknob and there was a chain on the door. Luckily there was a chair to prop under the doorknob to ensure complete security. I checked under the mattress and gave it the "all clear". I went in the bathroom and that also got the "all clear" (no bugs) too. The fixtures were old and worn. The inside of the bathroom door was smudged with dirt. The carpet looked clean and the walls were clean but slightly damaged. The bedding and towels were clean and soft. We slept fully clothed in our hiking attire with the light on but I got up and turned it off later. In the morning, we were anxious to get out but the nice young lady at the desk practically begged us to stay and have some breakfast. We thanked her but walked to a nearby café.   Some reviews mentioned the Bates Motel but actually, there are no real horror stories to tell about the 87 Motel.

If you have another option, stay somewhere else.  I reserved two rooms over a month from our arrival date.  When I got there they only had one room reserved.  After about 40 minutes of punching his old school computer keyboard, the manager found us another room.  Both rooms smelt like cats were living under the beds.  There were cigarette burns in the blankets.  The bathroom floor was dirty.  Somehow we were able to fall asleep though.  We were out the whole next day.  Came back in the evening and the room hadn't been cleaned except for 3 new towels in the bathroom.  Lights were on and TV was on in room.  I called the front desk to see why the room hadn't been cleaned.  They told me it should have been but next time to call and make sure housekeeping would come by.  Maybe I'm spoiled or something but I've never heard that one in a motel. This place is very convenient for New Paltz and they do have free Wi-Fi.  Otherwise, you won't find much you like.  I have my fingers crossed that I'm not bringing bed bugs back to my own home.

Nothing fancy but a good location and great service. Friendly 24-7 reception in a good spot just east of town. This is a great base for regional exploration. We enjoyed a full day of biking through the countryside, amazing historical Huguenot settlement in the middle of town, the nearby magnificent pedestrian bridge across the Hudson, fun eating experiences, and a relaxing atmosphere. Not the only choice in town but perhaps the best.

I ducked in to this motel to avoid dangerous rainy night-time driving, and I was so glad to've found them!  The rates are quite cheap, the ambiance is classic "motel USA", the room heaters worked quickly, the bed was comfy, the staff were nice, friendly people, and they're right next the the highway.  I don't know what more one could reasonably expect from a motel - this was pretty much perfect.

Totally adequate motel. About 3/4 of a mile from the downtown area. Breakfast is what you'd expect- bagels, etc. The people at the front desk are a little slow moving though it wasn't a major issue.
