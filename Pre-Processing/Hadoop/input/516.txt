Another one of my favorite races in Syracuse. Â Not nearly as big a party as the Utica Boilermaker but a fun race through most of the neighborhoods and all of the hills in Syracuse. An out and back race starting in Downtown Syracuse (Clinton Square). The folks in Syracuse do know how to throw a party.
A course not for the novice. It's a good challenge, and a wonderful run. It's got some scenic parts, but a few spots where I wasn't thrilled to be running through. The afterparty always seems to be a good time for all. Dinged one star for two reasons. First, every year it gets more crowded and becomes harder to run through as well get to things before and after. Second, the beer trailer really sucks. It is too small for the amount of people using it, expect to wait in line for a long time. It has always been staffed by rude people and has nothing but sh***y beers, we deserve better.
Da Best ! 10 miles of pretty forgiving hills, beer at the end, loud rock and roll in Clinton Square. Around 3000 maniacs ran in 2012 and had a great time. LOTS of bands along the way, great neighborhood support. Really cool view overlooking Syracuse at mile 5. It is the beginning of the summer running season in CNY. Do it. 3K event as well.
