Had a 6pm reservation and was there early, waiting patiently at the bar. The hostess stated to us that we only had until 7:30pm because there was a reservation for our table. I'm sorry but that was uncalled for and rude.  I have never had a hostess tell us we had to hurry. It wasn't super busy, even during Restaurant Week and we were on time for our reservation. Our waiter Sean was great.  The food (coconut shrimp appetizer,  seafood stew, shrimp penne and chocolate mascarpone crepes) was the perfect temp ready to eat and delicious. I took away 2 stars because we waited really long for water, was given one slice of bread when tables around us received more, excessive wait time for the appetizer, small table where I was bumped into a few times and the extremely rude hostess who gave obvious special treatment to her group of tipsy friends. She also continually came over and looked at tables to see if they were done, making others feel rushed. She could have been more subtle while doing her job - hovering at times.  When her loud group of friends showed up they were given special treatment,  to the point where their rude loud talking was ignored and the surrounding tables knew they were "friends". I will go back again, and hope that the particular hostess is not working or I just caught her on a mean night. The demeanor of the hostess, your first encounter of the dining experience,  should not be negative!
I think the portions were a little small but the food was very good. The staff was very friendly and service was pretty quick.

French onion soup was wonderful! We had two specials that exceeded expectations. Great addition to NT restaurants! Will be back again for sure.

We had excellent meals on a busy Friday night.  4 different dishes, 2 different appetizers and everyone was pleased with their food. Service was good and we all agreed we would definitely return. Highly recommend this restaurant if you like well prepared French food.

We just happened upon Webster's last week, and had a great experience. The food was great; the atmosphere was lively without interfering with our own conversation; service was friendly and attentive; and the price was less than you'd expect for an evening like this. Recommend the Grilled Webster salad for sure, and the Cassoulet was really good, too. We'll definitely venture up to Tonawanda again!

My wife and I ate at Webster's Bistro on Saturday night and were more than impressed with the quality of the food, service, atmosphere and price. We had wine, escargot, swordfish, steak, french onion soup, and bananas foster for desert. Fabulous flavors and experience overall!

Webster's opened a while ago and I admit I wish I went sooner..Do yourself a favor and don't make the same mistake I did. This restaurant can stack up to the best of them (Talking about ones in more popular suburbs), but make no mistake, this is a HIDDEN GEM in North Tonawanda. I'm labeling it a MUST GO. I went last night, a Wednesday night, for a family dinner. I didn't know much about the place. As soon as I walked in I was pleasantly surprised. The Atmosphere is very warm and welcoming. It took me back to my NYC days with fantastic décor making this place the prefect date place, family dinner place, or even business dinner location to take a client. The very professionally dressed staff was walking around calm, despite a full bar and dining room. Again it was mid week - i began to wonder then have I been missing something here? Locals clearly know its a great spot! For the Food we ordered the Escargots and Chicken Crepes, and a Apple salad to start, all outstanding. Since I wasn't sure what to expect this made our whole table now excited for dinners. The table olive bread is also very very good. We all ordered, from Chicken Cordon Blue, to Chicken Francaise, Seafood Stew, to Casserole and special of the night - Scallop/Shrimp in a lobster sauce over penne pasta. All of them I would order again and my family loved trying all the dishes. The food here so far is top of the line, for anywhere in Buffalo in my opinion. I can't wait to go back and try more. Venture out to North Tonawanda and give it a try...

My daughter and her husband are visiting from S.C. and haven't been to WBB so we had to be hittin it before they leave, Nice crowd for a Wednesday and hostess Rose Marie had no problem with us staying at the bar for a while before seating.  We enjoyed conversation and drinks for almost an hour beyond our res time.  When finally taking our seats we were hungry and it showed when we immediately ordered Mussels, Coconut Shrimp and TWO orders of Stuffed Peppers for the 5 of us.  Of course a bottle of Red Diamond Cab helped get all this down. I talked up the Casserole and the Chicken Francaise on the ride there so I guess it stuck in their head because after looking over the menu we went on to order the Casserole for my son-in-law and the Francaise for my daughter and her sister.  We ordered one of the specials which was Blackened Scallops with Mango Salsa accompanied by Grilled Brussel Sprouts and Risotto.  Again another bottle of Cab was needed.  We enjoyed every morsel but the girls did take home some Francaise to enjoy again the next day. Hard to believe but we had room to share some desserts so went on to order Banana Foster, Crepes and Chocolate Cake.  I can't believe I have to drive everyone home now. FYI, I think my son-in-law has a hollow leg.  True to form, as he exhibited on several Holidays, he can eat me under the table. Mark your calendar ........  Restaurant Week is coming!!! Sláinte

Myself and My wife and another couple chose this location for dinner.  We made an excellent choice.     The place is well appointed and the wait staff is solicitous.  The wine list is more than adequate and there is outstanding craft beer as well.  The food is awesome.  My Wife and My Friend had the Lamb Chops, His Wife ordered the Salmon.  They marveled at the presentation and enjoyed the well cooked entrees. I was pleased to find a Shrimp Scallop Penne offering on the specials list.  Its make up included a lobster cream sauce, asparagus tips and sun dried tomatoes.  It was one of the best pastas I have ever had.     We will be back for a third visit. If you haven't been there yet, what are You waiting for?

We had a Wonderful dinner here!  Our waiter Sean was the Best!  We highly recommend this restaurant!  We had a table of six in the front window and enjoyed the atmosphere, apps, entrees, drinks, desserts & Sean Rocked!

We made reservations ahead of time.  The restaurant is not open during the day but will call you back to confirm if you will leave a message and are willing to wait to see if they can accommodate you.  We seemed to surprise them as we walked in though as I mentioned we had a reservation.  A table had to be set for us and it took a rather long time.  The table was a tiny little metal thing on the patio with uneven legs and an uneven top.  We almost spilled our drinks a number of times due to the uneven top.  Food took a very long time to come out, almost an hour.  My wife got the chicken cordon bleu which is her favorite here.  It came out very cold and not very tasty.  She actually sent it away which I've never seen her do.  The owner came over and apologized and offered her some coconut shrimp which my wife didn't actually want but we didn't want to offend the owner so we accepted.  They weren't great either and kind of tasted like suntan lotion smells.  I ordered a strip steak medium rare which came out well done.  Charred on the outside and gray on the inside.  I don't send food back, especially after someone else does but really should have.  They weren't even really that busy but we were told the food took so long because it was the dinner rush (730 pm on a Tuesday) and they had a new chef which may have been the reason for the food issue.  The cordon bleu was comped which was a nice gesture as was the shrimp but I just don't know if we'll return after such a negative experience.

A really lovely addition to NT. The atmosphere and attention to detail inside make this a great date spot - from the real flowers on the table to the friendly staff, I'm glad we picked Webster's for our Friday date night. We came in at 7, without a reservation, and we were seated almost immediately-- though next time I would make a rez to err on the side of caution. The olive loaf and french bread were right up my ally. I ordered mussels and a garden salad, bf ordered the seafood bouillabaisse--everything tasted fresh and flavorful. Seafood all cooked perfectly. Service was generally good and prompt (though we had to wait for a while to get a water refill). It's not at the same price level or culinary creativity level as  800 Maple, but it's comparable in terms of the atmosphere. I look forward to summer evenings on their patio. Definitely recommend.

We really enjoyed Webster's Bistro. I have a soft spot for French cuisine. This is French/American so there's something for everyone. We sat on their patio for dinner, which was nice. I had the casserole which was fantastic. It reminded me of some meals we had in Quebec City. My wife got the chicken crepes and French onion soup, both of which were very good. We shared the stuffed peppers, which were generously covered in Gruyere. This is a very nice place to go, but not at all stuffy.

Visited last week during restaurant week.   I never would have thought a cool bistro, such as Websters existed in NT, as NT is known for bars and dives.  I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed the chicken francaise special.  I started with the zesty tomato soup, which had a fabulous kick to it.  The couscous added a nice texture.  The soup was not a purée, but did have some texture on its own.  Couscous was a nice touch. The main dish was chicken francaise and was tender, lightly breaded and sauted to perfection.  However, the real treat was underneath...a bed of creamy parmasan risotto.  The dish was topped off with bright green, and very fresh looking green beans, which I left untouched due to a personal hatred of them.  It is disappointing that so many restaurants believe green beans are the be all and end all to vegetables.  This shows lack of imagination in my opinion.   The website menu listed dessert as part of the $20.14 special, however, none was offered or served.  A serious transgression in my opinion.  This shows lack of attention to detail and is a sign that a restaurant misses the obvious.   All in all, good food, the regular menu was pricey.  I probably wouldn't go back other than for the special.  I doubt they will survive in this locale.  Perhaps they would do better in a Williamsville, Clarence, or east aurora type locale where overpriced, snooty restaurants are the norm.   Nice treat for the $20.14 price, but you can do better elsewhere.

I promised to give this review an update once I ate dinner here, so here it is! This is a great spot for an intimate date or to celebrate an occasion. It bids itself as a French style bistro and it succeeds in creating a distinct European atmosphere: from the music (when they play the French music -- please play it ALL the time!), to the lighting and the food; there's an elegant dining experience waiting for you (and your loved one!) here. My fiancé and I walked in here pretty late on a week night. It must have been around 8:45pm or so and dinner service was just about to end, but they seated us anyway (thank you!!). The service was really great and we understood that they were starting to clean up as we got our food. Despite that, we never felt rushed in anyway and we were grateful to have been seated without a reservation (because this place gets really busy on pretty much all nights of the week!). I ordered a french onion soup and their Beef Wellington Burger, while my fiancé ordered the Vegetarian Tartine and a Mushroom Napoleon. Our appetizers came out quickly and were super good! Her mushroom napolean was served in a puff pastry and was tender and full of flavor! My french onion soup was impeccable. Simply divine! Our entrees came out afterward and here's where I docked a star. My burger was pretty much done well and there was no pink in it at all, despite me asking for it medium rare. I did mention this to the waiter but let him know that it was okay, I didn't want to have them recook it as it was near closing down (plus I try not to waste food too much). I ate it and it was okay, but wish it was cooked to order. I did try my partner's Vegetarian Tartine and it was amazing. Crispy, fresh and oh so good! I plan on coming back here again soon. So far I've tried their chicken & crepes, cheese & pâté plate (which was great, but had too much blue cheese!) and their stuffed peppers along with the other menu items mentioned in this review. Everything but the burger has been worth raving about. The ambiance itself makes this place worthwhile to check out. I'm a huge fan!

This was my first trip to Webster's and my Grandmother's third! We got early reservations on a Friday evening and they were packed by the time we left. My thoughts: SERVICE. Fantastic; there was never a moment we weren't being tended to, even when the restaurant was packed. The entire staff was friendly and attentive from the moment we walked in the door. RESERVATIONS. Make one! BREAD. Absolutely wonderful .. be adventurous and try the olive loaf; you won't regret it! SALADS. Between the three of us, we had the garden, grilled, and Caesar salads. I had the grilled and it was WONDERFUL. MAIN COURSE. Here is the only part of the evening that derailed for me. My mom and Grandma loved their entrees; I didn't love mine at all. I had the special, chicken with parmesan risotto .. I felt the risotto was bland and the lemon sauce was overly tart. I tried a bite of my Grandmother's pasta (she had the shrimp and scallop penne, also a special) and found the pasta overly soft and sauce a bit fishier than I like. Regardless of this experience, I was so thrilled with everything else that I would happily go back and try another entrée. DESSERT. We shared the Crème Brulle; my mom said it's the best she's ever had. I enjoyed it as well. TIME. We were there for two hours; Webster's is truly a dining experience so plan on staying awhile!

Nothing but good things to say about this place, our waitress Amanda was super friendly and very helpful. Food did not take long to come to the table despite it being a busy Friday night and 6 of us at one time. I ordered the French onion soup and shared with my boyfriend, my mom ordered coconut shrimp that came with a fantastic spicy dipping sauce. Our entrees were everything I expected and more, I got the seafood stew which was perfectly cooked medley of seafood in a delicious seafood broth with linguine. Despite being stuffed three of is still ordered dessert. (My mango sorbet came with a candle because it was my birthday :] ) Everything we had was done very well, I will be returning someday to sample more of the menu without a doubt.

A very nice option for North Tonawanda.  I've had dinner here several times when visiting the area and have always been pleased.  Good food, reasonable prices, decent wine list (it could be a bit bigger, and I'd like at least one local option), and a good atmosphere for catching up with friends.  An enjoyable spot!

I can only comment on their Sunday Brunch (which I think they stopped due to lack of traffic) but we really enjoy this place.  We tried their Chicken Crepes, French Toast, Eggs Benedict, and Omelet.  All were amazing and served with a side of pastries.  The bartender, Kevin, also makes a great mimosa and is super friendly.  We loved the atmosphere and would really love to try their dinner menu after being so impressed.  Great addition to NT.

Had a 6pm reservation and was there early, waiting patiently at the bar. The hostess stated to us that we only had until 7:30pm because there was a reservation for our table. I'm sorry but that was uncalled for and rude.  I have never had a hostess tell us we had to hurry. It wasn't super busy, even during Restaurant Week and we were on time for our reservation. Our waiter Sean was great.  The food (coconut shrimp appetizer,  seafood stew, shrimp penne and chocolate mascarpone crepes) was the perfect temp ready to eat and delicious. I took away 2 stars because we waited really long for water, was given one slice of bread when tables around us received more, excessive wait time for the appetizer, small table where I was bumped into a few times and the extremely rude hostess who gave obvious special treatment to her group of tipsy friends. She also continually came over and looked at tables to see if they were done, making others feel rushed. She could have been more subtle while doing her job - hovering at times.  When her loud group of friends showed up they were given special treatment,  to the point where their rude loud talking was ignored and the surrounding tables knew they were "friends". I will go back again, and hope that the particular hostess is not working or I just caught her on a mean night. The demeanor of the hostess, your first encounter of the dining experience,  should not be negative!
