Love this place -- the vibe the instant you walk into this place is wonderful!  It's a total salon -- hair, color, nails, everything.  The space is designed in a smart, functional and smoothing way and the hair staff is incredible!!
I am always happy with my stylist, but I feel $50 is a bit much for a cut and blowdry in is area.  I  was also disappointed that the credits/rewards program didn't count the money I spent on spa laser services.
I agree that the decor and atmosphere is wonderful which is why I gave it 2 stars, otherwise it would have been 1 star. I had high hopes while waiting for my massage given the atmosphere, but was very disappointed with the results. I do not recommend this spa for a massage. First, they don't do 1 hour massages, only 50 minutes all of which is rushed and I'm not sure but I think the time they spend talking to you is included in that time. They give the barest attention to all areas. Just as you start to relax they move on to a different area. The lower back was not addressed at all which I thought was odd. My therapist also talked the whole time asking questions and offering ideas for my problem areas and seemed annoyed when I didn't seem receptive. Personally, I don't want to talk during my massage. Before or after is fine (which they did also). Overall it seemed like a massage factory. The therapist only had enough time to clean the rooms between clients. For $70 I expected much better.
