beach Dhaegs playground bocci? " well this is really wilkeson point. It's a great place to walk your dog, play fetch with them in the water.   Plan is once the sand study is completed at the beach, it should become an active swimming beach complete with lifeguards! (that's what the weird mesh netting thing is in the middle of the beach)   you can play beach volleyball down here! there is talk of a bocci court to be installed AND there's a water taxi dock for outer harbor concerts!
Located on the Buffalo waterfront is this surprising group of sculptures.  You have to make an effort to get here, but if you are a runner or biker etc. you will love coming here.  If you like to watch boats on the water this is also a good place.   Parking is easy here in a nice little parking lot.  Then you have a pleasant short walk to get up close and personal to the sculptures.   It's not an all day activity, although you could bring a picnic and stay a while.   Enjoy this part of the waterfront.
This is pretty much the only place I've ridden my bike and jogged around the city. It's very relaxing by the water. There's a small beach and restrooms nearby with doggie water. I love that the bike trail goes a long the water, into the woods, down by the lighthouse, over to Tifft. Whatever floats your meditation or exercise for the day.
Very cool Buffalo!  Love to see new can creative stuff like this going in.  Went out there for a run, but it was too small for that unless you wanted to do a loop or leave the park.  By the way go to the Times Beach Preserve which is located right next to the Outer Harbor Sculpture Park.  Very cool.  The only draw back is that it is located so close to downtown, but you have to take the long way around.  Not fun to get to by bike.
