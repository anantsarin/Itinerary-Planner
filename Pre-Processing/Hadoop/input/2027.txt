As goods it gets in NT. Hideaway Grille is clean, riff-raff free and provides a fair pour. Food is of fine quality. I enjoyed a doz clams on the half shell, mushroom soup, fresh corn bread w/honey butter, top notch prime rib, baked sweet potato w/maple syrup & walnuts for $30. It appears a healthy young buck may have an opportunity to dip his protected wick in one of the NT cougars occuping the patio. Happy hunting!
Another NT gem. I am only disappointed that we've lived in NT for over a year and only finally got to Hideaway for the first time today. Amazing specials, and if you want a little more variety than haddock for your fish fry Friday, you gotta hit Hideaway. It's a popular spot, so expect a wait at peak times, but pretty worth it. We went at 2pm on a Friday (no wait, obviously), got the soup & sandwich special (chicken gumbo & some amazing BBQ turkey & ham on pumpernickel) and a burger--- all delicious. We will be back!
Pros: Service, Rolls, 20oz Bone-in Rib eye Cons: Very small waiting area, parking lot Is it a good restaurant for kids? Yes Is it good choice for big groups? Yes Is the parking lot enough to accommodate the customers? No We decided to hang out with friends to have a nice time. It was around 6:30pm on a restaurant week and the restaurant was crowded. Our waiting estimated time was about 45 minutes, what to be true was less than that. So, if you are planning to go to this restaurant arrive around 5:30pm/6:00pm because the waiting area is very small and sometime can be too crowded. Plus the parking lot is not enough for the restaurant and you need to find some place on the street to stop your car. The waitress service was fantastic and the food did not take so much time to arrive to us. She was a very friendly, nice person and happy. And for what I noticed, not only her but the staff seems happy too. It is a very warm place and I can say unique in Buffalo, because I think I didn't find yet a place with waiter staff like this here yet. Today because I was carving for a meat, I tried the 20oz Bone-in Rib eye. Overall, I don't have anything to complain about the food. It was delicious! I could not find negative points about it. It was a long time that I didn't try a delicious rib eye like this. So, if you are looking for a place to hang out with friends or family, Hide Away Grille is your place.

I was here for lunch on a Saturday. We ordered beer battered fish & a Reuben sandwich. Service was good, however, I think that our young waitress provided incorrect information. Beer battered fish n' chips (special): Chips were excellent. However, the fish was lacking in taste. Also, the waitress told us that it was Haddock when she took our order. However, it tasted like catfish. This was confirmed when we overheard another waitress telling other customers that it was indeed Catfish. Reuben sandwich: Good portion. However, the sauce over powered the meat. Hence, the food was a disappointment. Service was average, plus the mis-information. Price was reasonable for the types and portion of food, but not worth it for the preparation, as outlined above. Won't be visiting here again Not a pro or con, but informational: The crowd was mostly seniors (over 60) at the time we ate (different parties that came in at different times). Cheers.

Great Menu! Great Food! Great Prices! Great atmosphere! I can't wait for the place to expand. My husband and I had a wonderful evening with friends. It does get busy but I plan to go back again and again.

Nice place. Food was great atmosphere was relaxed. The bartender was very attentive and sociable. I think his name was Nathan. He made us feel at home. I would not be writing a review if he did not give the service that he did. I will be going there again.

I generally avoid going anywhere in North Tonawanda.  Every time I go, I tend to get lost and confused; it's like a different world or something to me.  However, I ended up going there the other day for a bridal shower, and I was pleasantly surprised.  The decor of the banquet room was a little dreary in my opinion, but the rest of the restaurant looked decent, from what I saw.  The shower was a brunch, and the food was excellent.  There were mini bagels, lots of pastries (berry scones were the highlight of those!), eggs, bacon, and my favorite, potatoes.  The eggs and bacon were good, but to be fair, those are difficult to mess up.  Those potatoes though...let's just say I ate more than my fair share.  They were cut into large chunks, fried, and seasoned quite well.  I was feeling the grease the rest of the day, but oh so worth it.  I would go back...if I ever make it out to NT again!

The Best place for a beer battered fish fry in Buffalo Period!Gets really busy on Friday especially on lent. expect to park down the street and take a hike to get to this hidden but popular and packed restaurant. Their french fry's have a batter that leaves it tasty and crisp. Nice and clean place it is packed. I had one experience because we got seated at the bar and the waitress couldn't get to our table because of so much people.I took out of town family members here and every time they visit they request that we go here for a Friday fish fry.  This is not  too fancy but more business casual if your planning to eat inside but they have a nice patio that's great for summer days with a group of people. it didn't cost to much then expected. They at times wont take reservations on Fridays

This place is absolutely delicious.  Though I lived in downtown Buffalo, I'd make the drive out to the Hideaway pretty regularly.  They've got a pretty extensive and delicious menu, but its the specials that really shine.  This is the best restaurant in the Tonawandas.

Service was terrible. I ordered a baked fish that had pieces of skin still on it. My fiancée fish fry was extremely fishy tasting.  The waitress never checked on us after receiving our food.

I love the Hideaway.  Wonderful food and the atmosphere is great.  I'm glad that parking is better than it was in the past.  I wish them continued success.

My husband and I decided to stop by for dinner on our date night last night.  It was busy, but we were able to be seated promptly.  On Saturday night their special is prime rib.  Neither of us are fans of the fatty slab of beef so we opted for items from the traditional menu.  My husband had the strip steak (medium) and I had the Ahi tuna (rare).  Both entrees were cooked perfectly.  The only con about the whole night would be the bruschetta app.  For $7 were were expecting more than 4 small slices of french bread.  Other than the size, the bruschetta was pretty good.  Our waitress was very attentive and took very good care of us the entire night.

My husband and I went here with another couple for dinner.  It was not busy at all, the food and service was mediocre at best. We ordered the specialty bisque soup and they were out of it. How disappointing!

I went to the place when it first opened and wasn't impressed. Then for whatever reason years later gave it another go based on a recommendation from a friend. It became easily one of my favorite places to go in NT for a delicious meal. Their wings are great if you're looking for bar food. Out of the 10+ dinners I have had there I can honestly say I haven't been disappointed once. Which is tough for me. I can be quite critical of what I eat. If you're still cautious you can go during restaurant week.

Absolutely love this place. The service is always outstanding, and the food is incomparable.  The stuffed hot peppers and the bacon wrapped shrimp are my favorite appetizers, while the Pittsburgh steak salad is my usual go to dinner. Tried the fish last Friday, broiled Cajun haddock.  No disappointment as expected. Very tasty! Great date night place.

I tried this place randomly after being up that way to visit the gorge. I really enjoyed my lunch here! We sat at the bar and the bartender Jennifer was great! She was so friendly and attentive! We got some  appetizers, a beef/turkey burger, and a few beers. Everything came out really fast and perfect to order. I will definitely make the trip to come back here, it seems like the perfect place to grab a beer and appetizer to watch a Sabres or Bills game!

Hideaway is definitely a diamond in the rough of North Tonawanda. My Husband and I went about a year ago and both had a great experience so we decided to revisit last weekend! I called ahead since it was a Friday evening and the chances of a reservation being available are usually slim to none but we were happy to hear the hostess say they had plenty of openings. We were seated promptly upon arrival and placed an order for the stuffed banana peppers, a favorite appetizer of both parties. They were perfection, I highly recommend ordering these! For my entree I went with the sesame crusted tuna and Mike went with a filet mignon, oscar style. My tuna was cooked to perfection and came with a side of wasabi and soy (two of my favorite condiments). Mike didn't talk much while eating his steak, which typically means he is thoroughly enjoying it. When he came up from air, he confirmed that his steak was indeed delicious. The only critiques I have for hideaway is their lighting, its a little dim in there but not dim in a romantic way, dim in like a sleepy way. Also, the decor could probably use a little spruce-ing up. I do believe some of the newer restaurants in North Tonawanda (Remington, Webster Bistro, Smoke on the Water) are pulling some business away from Hideaway but I would hate to see such an awesome place fall by the wayside so make sure to consider it next time you are in the area, you won't regret it!

Went to Hideaway Grille today for the first time. First, I have to say their staff is extremely friendly. Our waitress/bartender remembered my name right off the bat and made conversation throughout our whole meal which was nice. They also put up with us for the 2 1/2 hours that we were there. The food was pretty good and it came quickly. I ordered half a caesar salad and a bowl of their cream of broccoli and cauliflower soup. The half salad was still pretty big and it was delicious. The soup was just okay. Kind of bland for what I was expecting. I had to add a lot of pepper and salt and it was still only mediocre. I hear that the chicken spetzel soup is awesome. I wish I would have just gotten a whole salad because it was that good. My boyfriend, his dad, and a guy I just met named Rudy all got the stuffed mushrooms and clams casino for appetizers. For someone that doesn't like mushrooms, I actually enjoyed them. I really dislike clams but I tried the clams casino anyway and I wasn't a fan at all, but everyone else loved them so I guess I'm just biased. Other than that, the atmosphere was great. It's a nice looking, spacious place. We sat at the bar, where they have flat screen tvs and quick draw. I think we won a total of $5. Overall, a good experience. UPDATE! Today I visited the Hideaway again, and I tried the french fries. They are delicious and crispy. They also gave me an ice cream sundae for my birthday even though it wasn't my birthday yet (two days early, can't complain). That is all :)

Another NT gem. I am only disappointed that we've lived in NT for over a year and only finally got to Hideaway for the first time today. Amazing specials, and if you want a little more variety than haddock for your fish fry Friday, you gotta hit Hideaway. It's a popular spot, so expect a wait at peak times, but pretty worth it. We went at 2pm on a Friday (no wait, obviously), got the soup & sandwich special (chicken gumbo & some amazing BBQ turkey & ham on pumpernickel) and a burger--- all delicious. We will be back!
