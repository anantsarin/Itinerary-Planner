Not sure why the average star rating is so low.   Maybe from when they first opened and suffered growing growing pains??  Fantastic brews, interesting and flavorful menu and TOP NOTCH service.   Have visited over a dozen times and have not been disappointed.
Love the decor, clean, new and very well done.  Their specials are enticing, but don't be hesitant to order the basic fish & chips and a beer sampler.  Just expect to then be too full to be convinced to order dessert. Good beers, great waitstaff, cool atmosphere. I went for lunch early on a Saturday, but am told that otherwise you're most certainly waiting for a seat.
Great beer! Great food! The menu was just big enough to offer something for everyone, and was executed to perfection. The big draw is their housemade sausages, and for good reason! Great atmosphere/decor with patio seating and cozy booths. All of the waitstaff we dealt with were friendly and our waiter had spot on recommendations for beer pairings. Overall, all the staff seemed very knowledgable and enthusiastic. You should definitely check this place out if you are in the area or make it a destination, we came from CT. Will be returning soon!
DELICIOUS food. They've got a CIA chef working the kitchen, and they make their own beer. The best place I've been while in Poughkeepsie.
Initially heard great things about this place from reliable sources from several Marist staff members. Me and gf went there this weekend and I had high hopes. The decor and vibe is pretty nice and laid back (kinda like a dive bar). This is where the complaints start..we got seated at a super awkward table in the corner of the restaurant that wasn't big enough for either of us (I'm 6'3, she's 6'5). Ordered the panda poutine and while it looked good, the fries were unseasoned and it was like swimming in soup, not gravy (GF had only ever had poutine once before, and i made it for her. Commented that mine was better and theres was bland). It was just kinda bland, and that described the rest of out dining experience. I got the roast pork (bland & slightly dry), she got a kielbasa (bland; tasted like it might if been store bought). The best thing I had was the beer. I'll go again for the beer and sit at the bar and maybe get some bar food to snack on, but probably won't dine in again. Ps Cornbread was pretty good
This place is great! We stopped in here on our way back from NYC as I had heard great things from reviews online. The place has ample parking, which is always great, and is very well-lit outside. We sat at the bar since it was a 2 hour wait that night (definitely a sign that they're doing something right) and our bartender was fun and provided great service. We tried the Alpha amber and cheese soup, Fazio farm burrata, and the K.O. wings. They were all absolutely delicious and I would definitely order all 3 again. I tried a flight and my fiancée tried the beekeeper's daisy cocktail. They were all delicious as well and I would have taken some beer home with me if they had any in bottles. Overall, it's a really great place and it has a great ambiance. I can tell that they will definitely be successful for a while if they keep the quality as good as it is now!
A group of six of us came here after much anticipation on their opening Friday night! We made reservations on open table, for nine pm, and arrived by cab so we could fully enjoy our night. The place is large with plenty of space to find a drink at the bar, or sit down for some dinner or appetizers. The ambiance was lively, but chill, with dim Edison bulbs in each fixture. The craft beer was tasty and unique. Food was amazing--each member of our party had rave reviews of the duck, ribs, NY strip, and scallops. Even though it was only their first weekend night open, and they were extremely busy, our wait staff was attentive and the experience was awesome. Great quality all around. We'll definitely be coming back, and we're happy to have such a great brewery here in Poughkeepsie.
Went Sunday afternoon. Seated immediately. We have special needs as two of the four of us are Gluten Free. No problem. Very knowledgeable staff. Starters of flank steak skewers were lick the plate tasty, Moroccan lamb ribs were warm, slightly spicy with just the right condiment. Dinner was one salmon (wonderful, perfectly cooked), the smoked pork chop (again amazing).  one had the Sea & Swine (a chef meal if I ever saw one. Total swoon). And one with a pulled pork sandwich with kettle chips. I kept stealing the chips off her plate. The apple and fennel slaw we added was being passed around with people fighting over it. Dessert offerings less comfortable with only the ice cream sundae able to be done really gluten free. Butterscotch pudding and dirt cups tasty. Server not overly attentive in a good way. When we needed something she was right there.  Kudos.
Overall, a wonderful addition to the local restaurant scene. I always love a place where I can get a burger and a beer, and the All American burger served here is, I think, the best in the Hudson Valley. It's burgervana. The beers brewed in-house are pretty good, but many seem to be malt-heavy, more so than I enjoy. However, they do support other local breweries like Newburgh, Captain Lawrence and Peekskill. I can usually find something on tap that fits the bill perfectly. My husband and I have been going since right after they opened, and we did experience some missteps like overly salted regular fries, poutine fries and spaetzle. But I chalk that up to new restaurant jitters. These issues seem to have worked out recently. And the salads are always perfectly dressed, a subtle detail that I always appreciate. Other menu highlights include the fried oyster appetizer and the kale salad. I've only tried a few, but all the deserts look phenomenal. But the shining star here is the brick oven pizza. It's authentic (as in, they actually use a brick oven, unlike some places I've been to in the area), the dough is flavorful with the right amount of chew, and the toppings are out of this world. Top notch. I thought I'd never get anything as good as Roberta's or Motorino in Brooklyn, but this is right up there. They've reorganized the front room, which overlooked the kitchen and beer vats, into a deli case featuring house made sausages. These babies rival both Fleisher's and the Meat Hook in Brooklyn. We've bought them on two occasions to grill out and they are amazing. Service is friendly, although occasionally harried, but still, I'm very happy Mill House is here.
Interesting mix of reviews on here.  This one was a little hard to review because there are positives and negatives but I really loved my meal and my beer so I am going with 4 stars.  I had the Pig & Fig Pizza which features figs, duck bacon, and arugula and was truly outstanding.  I also really enjoyed their "award winning" stout.  My husband's pale ale was really good but he thought his porky burger was overcooked and bland.  The real negative for me is that the kids' meals are $12!!!  That is highway robbery!  They include juice and ice cream but we opted for neither of those and they still charged us the full $12.  My son is three so that price just seems ridiculous to me.  Otherwise the place is nice -- beautifully decorated & friendly, attentive service.  As I said, my meal was delicious and the beers were very good, so I would still recommend it.
Excellent experience! I've been once and cannot wait to go again. The staff is friendly, knowledgable, and took great care of us, their beers are great and they have a good selection for all tastes, and the atmosphere is way cool. And the food! You know a place is good when you're even raving about the Brussels sprouts! Went there with a larger party and I got to sample lots of different things off the menu, every single thing was delicious and cooked to perfection. My friends and I (who eat out at different places quite a bit) were impressed with everything...I believe "explosion of flavor" was the phrase one of my friends used to describe the chicken. (Sounds like some of the other reviews on here were for a completely different place!) I also really liked how they've created a menu and atmosphere that accommodates both those looking for a more upscale dining experience and those just looking for a more casual crafted beer and burger - everyone can enjoy this place. I highly recommend.
I love Mill House. The decor is amazing. We were going there every week for a while after they opened. Yes, it's crowded, yes, I always make a reservation unless I pop in for lunch. They are not flawless but I think some of the reviews blur the personal boundary, like making cracks at the chef. Really? Like anything and anyone they are trying. Not everything I've had has been good, there have been a few stinkers at the table over the many times I've gone and many friends I've brought, but never enough to discount all of the good. Make a reservation and try it.
Tsk, tsk. This place should be better. Came on a Sunday afternoon, quiet- bar stools 25% taken. Greeted promptly and served first round of drinks. And that was it. Ate my entire meal with an empty glass. C'mon bartender! first priority is to sell me beer! I had to walk around to the other side to get him to come over and refill my glass. The uninspired bar food was disappointing as well. Fried pastrami balls were still cold in the middle (freezer to fryer). Burger was made with 8-pack style picnic bun. This place could be great. Prescription for managament/employees: PASSION. Only redeeming quality was decor.
Great food, and beer. Some of the portions were a little small for my liking though. Aside from that one minor setback, I loved it. Great atmosphere, friendly waiter. Can't wait to come back.
I have been to the bar here a couple times and have been very satisfied with the bar service. The bartenders are have a great knowledge of the beer selection and are well versed on the menu. The beers are excellent!  However, I am writing this review after bringing my girlfriend here for dinner on a Saturday night. After waiting an hour at the bar for a table we were approached by the host offering us a table "that would be part of a larger table in 50 minutes, so we would have to hurry." 20 minutes after declining that option we were seated. After a wait like that I was expecting exceptional service and food. We started with the cheese plate... fresh and delicious. However, the downward spiral started when our dinner came out a couple bites into the app. The meals were delivered by someone from the kitchen staff, asking if we were finished with the app that we had obviously just begun eating. After waiting this long for a table we expected to have a nice relaxing meal. The food was so-so... I ordered the salmon and the gf ordered the mushroom fetichini. Both were average, but extremely small portions. For the price it should have been great food or big portions... of which we had neither. Also, we ordered a bottle of Malbec when we sat down (having just finished our above average beers), which we didn't get until half way through our entrees. We ended up finishing the bottle of wine long after a check had been placed in front of us. I must say the place is beautiful... definitely well designed and comfortable seating. However, I expected more from this establishment. I went in with high expectations, and perhaps that is why I am so dissapointed. After reading other reviews I had expected a restaurant first, brewery second, but now know better. I would go again for a beer and app at the bar, but there are much better options for dinner in Poughkeepsie, especially considering the wait and price.
Pros: pleasant atmosphere, excellent waiter, wide variety of beers.   Cons:  the food was terrible.  Hamburger was rare despite being ordered medium. Thai sausage was cold, undercooked, and inedible.  Food is expensive and not worth the cost. Bottom line: fun place to hang with friends for some delicious beers.  But eat before you go because the food gets 1 star in my opinion.
I've been to the mill house numerous times for drinks and appetizers (which was never a disappointment) but had my first real dining experience here this weekend. The ambience, the service, the food, the drinks were all great! It was lively. Server was friendly and knowledgable. Food came out quickly. My friend and I shared the poutine which was so yummy, and I consider myself a poutine snob. I had a pizza with figs and duck bacon- the fire grill makes the crust delicious. My friend had the pulled pork sandwich which he gobbled down; BBQ sauce had a nice tang to it and I ate half of his homemade chips. Will definitely be going back soon! I'm so glad Poughkeepsie finally has a place like the mill house.
To start I will say the place is nice. You can tell its new and looks like a renovated old building.   The bar area is very small and cramped.  Bartenders are attentive and friendly. I was one of a party of 12 with a 6:45 reservation on a Saturday Night for an adult birthday celebration.   We had reserved a table on the private 3rd floor well in advance and expected to be seated there.  Upon arrival we were told we couldn't have the table we reserved because a larger group had come in and they needed it for them.  What they ended up doing is putting together a few high tops in front of the open kitchen located next to the front door.  The area was less than ideal for a few reasons: It was cramped, traffic from the front door and kitchen, it was hot and cold (kitchen heat and front door open) and the long table, as opposed to the horseshoe we should have had with our original reservation, made it impossible for us to talk.  And in general, high tops are generally not comfortable for a long dinner. Worst part is, the management was so matter of fact about moving us. The waiter was nice enough but service was slow and the waiter was not knowledgable about the menu or beer selection.  I asked about the lager selection and he said he didn't think they carried lager. IT'S A BREWERY.  Enough said.  Also, it was 7pm and they were out of several items including 4 salads and the chowder.  Unless they have a huge early bird special crowd, I dont get it. Additionally,  the waiter was not very attentive.  We had to ask for drinks every time we needed a refill as we were not asked if we needed drinks. At least on my end of the table.  The food.  I give the food a solid D.  No one at my table liked their meal and I was the only one who liked my app which was an iceberg wedge.  Not too hard to mess up. Lettuce was crisp and fresh. Dressing was great. I only had a rib eye sandwich special for my meal but it was way too salty,  VERY thin (2 slices of meat).  They advertised it as being on brioche but it was on a hamburger bun.  The fries were overcooked yet soggy and over salted.  Dessert which was some sort of chocolate cake that didn't seem freshly made.  It was more like a box cake.  It was soaked in sauces that didn't really enhance the dessert just made it sweeter and was topped with a watery whipped topping.  Of the 12 of us we all agreed we wouldn't go back.  I have eaten at some good places.  Including some really good pub grub places and this one was a solid D like I said.  After 2 hours we were told they needed the table.   While we weren't rushed, the service was slow so we should have been given more time. They did buy us a round at the bar to make up for it which I thought was nice. I know its a new place and all the rage in Pok but I was not impressed at all. Living close to all the great restaurants in Westchester, CT and NYC I dont think I would go back. Even if I found myself in Poughkeepsie for some reason I would rather go to the diner down the road.
Hey there Mill House - love ya!  Will be visiting again next time I'm up north.
The food was tasty and the place looks nice though I found it missing charm and coziness. It invokes the feeling of an upscale chain restaurant. The waiters are also trained to speak as if you are dining at Applebee's. "Hi ya! My name is John and I will be your server, what can I get you started with tonight". There's nothing wrong with this, but it's just not my style. Very impersonal and robotic. All this being said, the menu is huge, our pizza and fish and chips was good and everything coming out of the kitchen looked fine. Just not into the corporate feeling of the place.
Found this gem while in town for a bowling tournament.  Our waitress Carol was great.  The ambiance is beautiful just what you would expect, brick walls, craft beer, optional outdoor seating. Home made sausage is a specialty.  Recommend beer flights to start.  Would definitely come back.
The "Porky" burger, pretty damn good. Scarfed it down in a matter of secs. The jalapeño mayo was a great addition.
After the poor service on the phone I will never go there!  Tried making a reservation for 5 people at 5:45 PM and was told while making the reservation that we would need to be done by 7pm.  Rushing a customer out before they're even there?  Shame on your wait staff who makes the reservations.. they're losing your money before you even get people in the door.  We'll be taking our holiday party elsewhere where we won't be told we have a 75 minute  time limit!
Went for HVRW and the menu had excellent choices.  I will admit I didn't go with the menu as we were there for lunch and I really wanted to try something else.  Wishing I had been adventurous and tried it now, but my dish was still excellent.  I had the brat with cheddar and it came with purple cabbage and German noodles (the only part I could have passed on as they were fried and a bit dark for my liking).  Friend #1 had the pulled pork sandwich and basically licked her plate then asked for a bag to take home the chips she couldn't eat.  Friend #2 had the margharita pizza and a salad.  I tried the pizza and it was very good.  Planning to come back so I can test out the beer!
Absolutely delicious. Best pizza ever. Great beer. Has to be a culinary school graduate. Best pub anywhere.
Had dinner here tonight with my girlfriend, was a fantastic experience, great home brewed beer for just about everyones palate. Our server Ryan was nice and attentive. The wings from the bar were out of this world as was the "porky burger". Good selection of liquors and aperitifs. This place has been PACKED (no surprise with food and beer this good) the two times I've been so make sure you have a reservation. Keep up the good work!
I have been meaning to join yelp for years since I have been freeloading for about that long and this is the place that finally made me pull the trigger. We live 45 minutes closer to NYC and were in this area visiting the FDR homestead and I went on yelp looking for a good dinner option. This place was awesome. The beer was very tasty (I was happy to hear that they are going to start distributing it) the pretzel app was solid, the calamari salad was delicious, the burger was good (not great) and the fries were strong. My wife had the "smothered steak" which was fabulous and the highlight of the night was the brown sugar butter cake which I wish I could have shipped to my house whenever I like.....the place was very nice inside and the staff was quite friendly. If it were closer to our house we would be regulars.
Great atmosphere and the way that they renovated from what it used to be is amazing! I tried their Cold Steady Stout and was pleasantly pleased! It wasn't too heavy and had a chocolatey espresso flavor! Very nice! I finished with a coffee and side car of Fra Angelico at the bar, which was also very tasty. I didn't feel rushed to get out for the bar crowd and it was a nice mix of age groups. I can't wait to go back and try the food!
Great artisan crafted food; unique offerings that are fresh, perfectly seasoned and served quickly.  The portions are a tad small but the pricing is reasonable.  Derek our waiter was super friendly and efficient.   My brother got an education on the beer tastings from the bartender.  Fun and informative!  Great renovation, furnishings and choices of seating.  My brother had two servings of the fried Oysters; he said they were that amazing!  I had the Ale & cheese soup; delightfully tasty & light for what it is!  We tried the wings, two sausage dishes and the pulled pork sandwich.  Perfectly seasoned and not a salty after taste.  It makes a difference when food is fresh and prepared on premises.  We dined on Wednesday for early dinner.  They are currently closed on Tuesdays.
The decor was very good.  Nothing special about the food.. I had their own brewed IPA.. It was weak.  I am not sure what the big fuss is about this place.  Its location is poor and the food is average.  Certainly over-rated
I've go to say, I'm huge into locally made food, beer, and other products. I went to a concert at the chance so i figured i'd take advantage and try this place. The interior decor is awesome, great great atmosphere.....but that's where it ends for me. The beer just was not anything special. The soft pretzels were good but when are they not good? I had a flight so I tried all the made in house beers and I was not impressed, with Newburgh Brewery, Peekskill Brewery, and Captain Lawrence Brewery's all in the surrounding areas and all making excellent brews, I will not be back to Mill House.
Well, we went back, with a reservation, and had a totally great experience. We sat upstairs, had a great, very attentive waitress. Our food and drinks came out very quickly, which was great because we were hungry! Being that we were hungry, we ordered WAY too much food. We started with the poutine (amazing, we'll get it again) and the sage and garlic sausage (sausage was not our favorite but we loved everything it came with), then we ordered a pizza and a burger. The burger was great, although we were starting to slow down and we were too stuffed to eat the pizza (it was tasty as a snack later though, the pizza crust was perfect). All in all a great experience and we'll be back again soon.
We really, really wanted this to be a great place.  I have followed their preparation to open on Facebook.  We went twice the opening weekend, once to the bar on Friday evening and once for lunch on Saturday with a 12 year old son.   At this point, given both experiences, two stars seems about right.  We experienced several problems, which fall into three categories, I think:  Opening problems (don't have their process and business worked out yet--these may be corrected), poorly executed food (a real worry), and cuisine choices (personal gripes that may not be relevant to others). Number 1: When we went on Friday, they were trying to switch from lunch to dinner.  The timing was slow so we could not order apps for long time.  This may be their operating plan, but I expect they will rethink it.  The happy-hour appetizer crowd would seem to be a key demographic for them. When we did order poutine, the busboy literally asked if he could take it before we had had more than one bite, and then repeatedly asked.  Even half picking it up once when it was half full.  They are trying for too-fancy service perhaps?  Perhaps the staff were over excited for opening week? Not so big a deal. However when we returned for our family reservation on Saturday, there were more basic execution problems:  several of the food items we ordered were cold, not "less warm" but outright chilled.  These were cornbread, on the point of being frozen, and baby back ribs which were cold and with their flavorful smoked fat still congealed.  Ok, some items are prepared in advance and chilled, but serving them without getting the reheat and prep correct is a rookie error. . . Then when our bill came we were charged for the dinner rather than lunch price of all our entrees, a significant difference.  The manager apologized but was surly and brusque about it. Number 2:  The food was ok, really slightly less than ok, for the most part.  For my son's fish and chips, the fries were not cooked to take advantage of the duck fat--soggy at best.  The fish was not flakey on the inside the way good fish and chips is, it was lumpy and wet.  I don't know enough about frying to describe the problem, but I know what good fried cod is supposed to be. My wife's salmon, likewise was ok but marinated so long that it was goopey on the inside.  The hopping john was good.  My ribs and cornbread were, obviously, not good, being cold. I didn't send them back because we were tightly scheduled and I just didn't feel like the hassle.  I took them home and warmed them later for family snacks.  They were ok.  The smoke was a little long for baby backs. If they want the amount of smoke flavor they are getting at they should do spare ribs to stand up to the strong flavor. Number 3:  They have made an ideological choice to tend to the bland.  Nothing, with the possible exception of the ribs, had much flavor to it.  Bun with pork belly should have some heat, vinegar,  or flavor shouldn't it?  This was my overall impression of all the food:  bland.  And they don't put salt and pepper on the table so you can't even correct those simple seasonings.  But it really was more than salt/pepper.  It was a choice to make milquetoast food that would offend no one, and thus will be great to no one. The beer somewhat follows this same pattern:  The session IPA was barely IPA, the black double IPA was a joke in that category.  They did better with the less hoppy brews.  The heavy ale (kilt spinner) was quite good and the stout was excellent.  My wife ordered a martini at the bar and the bartender wasn't sure what vermouth was or where it would be . . . Dry is one thing, but so dry that you refuse to recognize the very existence of vermouth? So overall, a regrettable two visits.  I will go back after a few months to see if things have improved and to try a few other menu items.  It could be we just chose very poorly--the sausages and charcuterie sounded good on the menu.  I expect they are trying to do too much: making sausage, pizza, smoking, charcuterie, and their own beer.  A lot to get right without it all turning out mediocre.
Good place to go for lunch or dinner.  Seems like a big early rush cause they are new, but good food and service.  Lunch portion is ok but dinner could be bigger, was still hungry when I was done with dinner. So were the 3 other people who had dinner with me.
Good times. Can be hot or miss though. Try the house made sausages or tuna tacos if they are available .
Came here twice already. Once at 4pm on a Saturday, and was told that they weren't serving dinner for two hours and not seating anyone in the dining area. Ok, it's their opening week. Came on the following day, Sunday, and was immediately asked if I had a reservation. I didn't. Then I was told that there was a 45 minutes wait. They had 3 empty tables and no other people waiting. I was then told those tables were "taken". I'm pretty certain that I will never go back. Good luck with treating customers the way you did to me.
Chef Dan Crocco added brick oven pizzas to his repertoire when he moved with his crew from Brasserie 292. Here, the in house brews are complemented by a menu focusing on Dan's home made charcuterie and pub menu classics. Wonderful stuff, and lots of fun.
Service was lacking and meal felt rushed. They could not wait to clear our table fast bought. Has a nice atmosphere and food was pretty good. Waitress could have been a lot kinder though.
This place is amazing. The bartenders are great and the food is right up to par. Joel is my favorite server. I have been here over 5 times and I would gladly return again. The value of the wine list is great for my girlfriends that aren't huge beer drinkers. I am l definitely a beer drinker now though. I would recommend it to all my friends!
The food, beer, atmosphere and service are all phenomenal. This place was well worth the wait
Freakin awesome. These guys know how to run a restaurant. This is even better than Brasserie, with a different food and drink. The service was excellent. Attentive. Intuitive about attending to dishes. Complete professionals. The food was so good. Kale salad - which Im not usually a fan of was meaty, buttery and the pad thai dressing paired so perfectly. The deep fried franks red hot brussels sprouts were awesome. Maybe ask for extra  red hot powder if you really like franks. Ive never had this dish anywhere before. Unfortunately I was there for lunch during work, and unfortunately, my work had a strict no alcohol policy during work hours. If it was dinner, I would have ordered every one of their special mixed drinks on the menu. They all looked so ... So ... Drinkable. Just go.
The main draw of this place is the beer. There's a huge selection and it alls eems pretty well crafted. We arrived for our reservation and were told they were backed up. After waiting 30 minutes, our table cleared and we were able to sit. Not their fault, so it was okay. It was a busy night and we hung out by the bar. The food came quickly and was hot. The food was good - nothing rave worthy. I got the pulled pork sandwich and the bread couldn't hold up to the amount of liquid, so I ended up just eating it with a fork. Dining companion got a burger and same scenario there.
Great atmosphere and very nice looking place.  I had the flat iron steak, and I was very disappointed not only in the portion, but the sides that came with it.  I literally had about 6 green beans with it, and the mashed potatoes couldn't be more than a teaspoon.  All I know is if I leave a restaurant hungry, that is a place I won't go back to. Staff was a bit slow, and one of the guys I went with had to ask for a beer 4 times before he actually got it.
I heard they were new in town, and since my coworker and I were visiting, we decided to check it out. The panda poutine is delicious, even though I'm not sure if it being called panda is accurate. It wasn't exactly black and white, but no worries about the name, still good! I also had the Moroccan spiced lamb ribs which were good, possibly a tad sweet. The Sea and Swine was a good idea except the citrus scented pork belly was way too salty. My coworker got a special of the day which was a buffalo oyster sandwich with fries. He said it wasn't bad. I guess I'd expect better tasting food from a restaurant that looks so popular. That or I didn't order the right items.
Not sure why the average star rating is so low.   Maybe from when they first opened and suffered growing growing pains??  Fantastic brews, interesting and flavorful menu and TOP NOTCH service.   Have visited over a dozen times and have not been disappointed.
Great beer! Great food! The menu was just big enough to offer something for everyone, and was executed to perfection. The big draw is their housemade sausages, and for good reason! Great atmosphere/decor with patio seating and cozy booths. All of the waitstaff we dealt with were friendly and our waiter had spot on recommendations for beer pairings. Overall, all the staff seemed very knowledgable and enthusiastic. You should definitely check this place out if you are in the area or make it a destination, we came from CT. Will be returning soon!
Initially heard great things about this place from reliable sources from several Marist staff members. Me and gf went there this weekend and I had high hopes. The decor and vibe is pretty nice and laid back (kinda like a dive bar). This is where the complaints start..we got seated at a super awkward table in the corner of the restaurant that wasn't big enough for either of us (I'm 6'3, she's 6'5). Ordered the panda poutine and while it looked good, the fries were unseasoned and it was like swimming in soup, not gravy (GF had only ever had poutine once before, and i made it for her. Commented that mine was better and theres was bland). It was just kinda bland, and that described the rest of out dining experience. I got the roast pork (bland & slightly dry), she got a kielbasa (bland; tasted like it might if been store bought). The best thing I had was the beer. I'll go again for the beer and sit at the bar and maybe get some bar food to snack on, but probably won't dine in again. Ps Cornbread was pretty good
This place is great! We stopped in here on our way back from NYC as I had heard great things from reviews online. The place has ample parking, which is always great, and is very well-lit outside.

Went Sunday afternoon. Seated immediately. We have special needs as two of the four of us are Gluten Free. No problem. Very knowledgeable staff. Starters of flank steak skewers were lick the plate tasty, Moroccan lamb ribs were warm, slightly spicy with just the right condiment. Dinner was one salmon (wonderful, perfectly cooked), the smoked pork chop (again amazing).  one had the Sea & Swine (a chef meal if I ever saw one. Total swoon). And one with a pulled pork sandwich with kettle chips. I kept stealing the chips off her plate. The apple and fennel slaw we added was being passed around with people fighting over it. Dessert offerings less comfortable with only the ice cream sundae able to be done really gluten free. Butterscotch pudding and dirt cups tasty. Server not overly attentive in a good way. When we needed something she was right there.  Kudos.
Interesting mix of reviews on here.  This one was a little hard to review because there are positives and negatives but I really loved my meal and my beer so I am going with 4 stars.  I had the Pig & Fig Pizza which features figs, duck bacon, and arugula and was truly outstanding.  I also really enjoyed their "award winning" stout.  My husband's pale ale was really good but he thought his porky burger was overcooked and bland.  The real negative for me is that the kids' meals are $12!!!  That is highway robbery!  They include juice and ice cream but we opted for neither of those and they still charged us the full $12.  My son is three so that price just seems ridiculous to me.  Otherwise the place is nice -- beautifully decorated & friendly, attentive service.  As I said, my meal was delicious and the beers were very good, so I would still recommend it.
Excellent experience! I've been once and cannot wait to go again. The staff is friendly, knowledgable, and took great care of us, their beers are great and they have a good selection for all tastes, and the atmosphere is way cool. And the food! You know a place is good when you're even raving about the Brussels sprouts! Went there with a larger party and I got to sample lots of different things off the menu, every single thing was delicious and cooked to perfection. My friends and I (who eat out at different places quite a bit) were impressed with everything...I believe "explosion of flavor" was the phrase one of my friends used to describe the chicken. (Sounds like some of the other reviews on here were for a completely different place!) I also really liked how they've created a menu and atmosphere that accommodates both those looking for a more upscale dining experience and those just looking for a more casual crafted beer and burger - everyone can enjoy this place. I highly recommend.
I love Mill House. The decor is amazing. We were going there every week for a while after they opened. Yes, it's crowded, yes, I always make a reservation unless I pop in for lunch. They are not flawless but I think some of the reviews blur the personal boundary, like making cracks at the chef. Really? Like anything and anyone they are trying. Not everything I've had has been good, there have been a few stinkers at the table over the many times I've gone and many friends I've brought, but never enough to discount all of the good. Make a reservation and try it.
Tsk, tsk. This place should be better. Came on a Sunday afternoon, quiet- bar stools 25% taken. Greeted promptly and served first round of drinks. And that was it. Ate my entire meal with an empty glass. C'mon bartender! first priority is to sell me beer! I had to walk around to the other side to get him to come over and refill my glass. The uninspired bar food was disappointing as well. Fried pastrami balls were still cold in the middle (freezer to fryer). Burger was made with 8-pack style picnic bun. This place could be great. Prescription for managament/employees: PASSION. Only redeeming quality was decor.
Great food, and beer. Some of the portions were a little small for my liking though. Aside from that one minor setback, I loved it. Great atmosphere, friendly waiter. Can't wait to come back.
I have been to the bar here a couple times and have been very satisfied with the bar service. The bartenders are have a great knowledge of the beer selection and are well versed on the menu. The beers are excellent!  However, I am writing this review after bringing my girlfriend here for dinner on a Saturday night. After waiting an hour at the bar for a table we were approached by the host offering us a table "that would be part of a larger table in 50 minutes, so we would have to hurry." 20 minutes after declining that option we were seated. After a wait like that I was expecting exceptional service and food. We started with the cheese plate... fresh and delicious. However, the downward spiral started when our dinner came out a couple bites into the app. The meals were delivered by someone from the kitchen staff, asking if we were finished with the app that we had obviously just begun eating. After waiting this long for a table we expected to have a nice relaxing meal. The food was so-so... I ordered the salmon and the gf ordered the mushroom fetichini. Both were average, but extremely small portions. For the price it should have been great food or big portions... of which we had neither. Also, we ordered a bottle of Malbec when we sat down (having just finished our above average beers), which we didn't get until half way through our entrees. We ended up finishing the bottle of wine long after a check had been placed in front of us. I must say the place is beautiful... definitely well designed and comfortable seating. However, I expected more from this establishment. I went in with high expectations, and perhaps that is why I am so dissapointed. After reading other reviews I had expected a restaurant first, brewery second, but now know better. I would go again for a beer and app at the bar, but there are much better options for dinner in Poughkeepsie, especially considering the wait and price.
Pros: pleasant atmosphere, excellent waiter, wide variety of beers.   Cons:  the food was terrible.  Hamburger was rare despite being ordered medium. Thai sausage was cold, undercooked, and inedible.  Food is expensive and not worth the cost. Bottom line: fun place to hang with friends for some delicious beers.  But eat before you go because the food gets 1 star in my opinion.
I've been to the mill house numerous times for drinks and appetizers (which was never a disappointment) but had my first real dining experience here this weekend. The ambience, the service, the food, the drinks were all great! It was lively. Server was friendly and knowledgable. Food came out quickly. My friend and I shared the poutine which was so yummy, and I consider myself a poutine snob. I had a pizza with figs and duck bacon- the fire grill makes the crust delicious. My friend had the pulled pork sandwich which he gobbled down; BBQ sauce had a nice tang to it and I ate half of his homemade chips. Will definitely be going back soon! I'm so glad Poughkeepsie finally has a place like the mill house.
To start I will say the place is nice. You can tell its new and looks like a renovated old building.   The bar area is very small and cramped.  Bartenders are attentive and friendly. I was one of a party of 12 with a 6:45 reservation on a Saturday Night for an adult birthday celebration.   We had reserved a table on the private 3rd floor well in advance and expected to be seated there.  Upon arrival we were told we couldn't have the table we reserved because a larger group had come in and they needed it for them.  What they ended up doing is putting together a few high tops in front of the open kitchen located next to the front door.  The area was less than ideal for a few reasons: It was cramped, traffic from the front door and kitchen, it was hot and cold (kitchen heat and front door open) and the long table, as opposed to the horseshoe we should have had with our original reservation, made it impossible for us to talk.  And in general, high tops are generally not comfortable for a long dinner. Worst part is, the management was so matter of fact about moving us. The waiter was nice enough but service was slow and the waiter was not knowledgable about the menu or beer selection.  I asked about the lager selection and he said he didn't think they carried lager. IT'S A BREWERY.  Enough said.  Also, it was 7pm and they were out of several items including 4 salads and the chowder.  Unless they have a huge early bird special crowd, I dont get it. Additionally,  the waiter was not very attentive.  We had to ask for drinks every time we needed a refill as we were not asked if we needed drinks. At least on my end of the table.  The food.  I give the food a solid D.  No one at my table liked their meal and I was the only one who liked my app which was an iceberg wedge.  Not too hard to mess up. Lettuce was crisp and fresh. Dressing was great. I only had a rib eye sandwich special for my meal but it was way too salty,  VERY thin (2 slices of meat).  They advertised it as being on brioche but it was on a hamburger bun.  The fries were overcooked yet soggy and over salted.  Dessert which was some sort of chocolate cake that didn't seem freshly made.  It was more like a box cake.  It was soaked in sauces that didn't really enhance the dessert just made it sweeter and was topped with a watery whipped topping.  Of the 12 of us we all agreed we wouldn't go back.  I have eaten at some good places.  Including some really good pub grub places and this one was a solid D like I said.  After 2 hours we were told they needed the table.   While we weren't rushed, the service was slow so we should have been given more time. They did buy us a round at the bar to make up for it which I thought was nice. I know its a new place and all the rage in Pok but I was not impressed at all. Living close to all the great restaurants in Westchester, CT and NYC I dont think I would go back. Even if I found myself in Poughkeepsie for some reason I would rather go to the diner down the road.
Hey there Mill House - love ya!  Will be visiting again next time I'm up north.
The food was tasty and the place looks nice though I found it missing charm and coziness. It invokes the feeling of an upscale chain restaurant. The waiters are also trained to speak as if you are dining at Applebee's. "Hi ya! My name is John and I will be your server, what can I get you started with tonight". There's nothing wrong with this, but it's just not my style. Very impersonal and robotic. All this being said, the menu is huge, our pizza and fish and chips was good and everything coming out of the kitchen looked fine. Just not into the corporate feeling of the place.
Found this gem while in town for a bowling tournament.  Our waitress Carol was great.  The ambiance is beautiful just what you would expect, brick walls, craft beer, optional outdoor seating. Home made sausage is a specialty.  Recommend beer flights to start.  Would definitely come back.
The "Porky" burger, pretty damn good. Scarfed it down in a matter of secs. The jalapeño mayo was a great addition.
After the poor service on the phone I will never go there!  Tried making a reservation for 5 people at 5:45 PM and was told while making the reservation that we would need to be done by 7pm.  Rushing a customer out before they're even there?  Shame on your wait staff who makes the reservations.. they're losing your money before you even get people in the door.  We'll be taking our holiday party elsewhere where we won't be told we have a 75 minute  time limit!
Went for HVRW and the menu had excellent choices.  I will admit I didn't go with the menu as we were there for lunch and I really wanted to try something else.  Wishing I had been adventurous and tried it now, but my dish was still excellent.  I had the brat with cheddar and it came with purple cabbage and German noodles (the only part I could have passed on as they were fried and a bit dark for my liking).  Friend #1 had the pulled pork sandwich and basically licked her plate then asked for a bag to take home the chips she couldn't eat.  Friend #2 had the margharita pizza and a salad.  I tried the pizza and it was very good.  Planning to come back so I can test out the beer!
Absolutely delicious. Best pizza ever. Great beer. Has to be a culinary school graduate. Best pub anywhere.
Had dinner here tonight with my girlfriend, was a fantastic experience, great home brewed beer for just about everyones palate. Our server Ryan was nice and attentive. The wings from the bar were out of this world as was the "porky burger". Good selection of liquors and aperitifs. This place has been PACKED (no surprise with food and beer this good) the two times I've been so make sure you have a reservation. Keep up the good work!
I have been meaning to join yelp for years since I have been freeloading for about that long and this is the place that finally made me pull the trigger. We live 45 minutes closer to NYC and were in this area visiting the FDR homestead and I went on yelp looking for a good dinner option. This place was awesome. The beer was very tasty (I was happy to hear that they are going to start distributing it) the pretzel app was solid, the calamari salad was delicious, the burger was good (not great) and the fries were strong. My wife had the "smothered steak" which was fabulous and the highlight of the night was the brown sugar butter cake which I wish I could have shipped to my house whenever I like.....the place was very nice inside and the staff was quite friendly. If it were closer to our house we would be regulars.
Great atmosphere and the way that they renovated from what it used to be is amazing! I tried their Cold Steady Stout and was pleasantly pleased! It wasn't too heavy and had a chocolatey espresso flavor! Very nice! I finished with a coffee and side car of Fra Angelico at the bar, which was also very tasty. I didn't feel rushed to get out for the bar crowd and it was a nice mix of age groups. I can't wait to go back and try the food!
Great artisan crafted food; unique offerings that are fresh, perfectly seasoned and served quickly.  The portions are a tad small but the pricing is reasonable.  Derek our waiter was super friendly and efficient.   My brother got an education on the beer tastings from the bartender.  Fun and informative!  Great renovation, furnishings and choices of seating.  My brother had two servings of the fried Oysters; he said they were that amazing!  I had the Ale & cheese soup; delightfully tasty & light for what it is!  We tried the wings, two sausage dishes and the pulled pork sandwich.  Perfectly seasoned and not a salty after taste.  It makes a difference when food is fresh and prepared on premises.  We dined on Wednesday for early dinner.  They are currently closed on Tuesdays.
The decor was very good.  Nothing special about the food.. I had their own brewed IPA.. It was weak.  I am not sure what the big fuss is about this place.  Its location is poor and the food is average.  Certainly over-rated
I've go to say, I'm huge into locally made food, beer, and other products. I went to a concert at the chance so i figured i'd take advantage and try this place. The interior decor is awesome, great great atmosphere.....but that's where it ends for me. The beer just was not anything special. The soft pretzels were good but when are they not good? I had a flight so I tried all the made in house beers and I was not impressed, with Newburgh Brewery, Peekskill Brewery, and Captain Lawrence Brewery's all in the surrounding areas and all making excellent brews, I will not be back to Mill House.
Well, we went back, with a reservation, and had a totally great experience. We sat upstairs, had a great, very attentive waitress. Our food and drinks came out very quickly, which was great because we were hungry! Being that we were hungry, we ordered WAY too much food. We started with the poutine (amazing, we'll get it again) and the sage and garlic sausage (sausage was not our favorite but we loved everything it came with), then we ordered a pizza and a burger. The burger was great, although we were starting to slow down and we were too stuffed to eat the pizza (it was tasty as a snack later though, the pizza crust was perfect). All in all a great experience and we'll be back again soon.
We really, really wanted this to be a great place.  I have followed their preparation to open on Facebook.  We went twice the opening weekend, once to the bar on Friday evening and once for lunch on Saturday with a 12 year old son.   At this point, given both experiences, two stars seems about right.  We experienced several problems, which fall into three categories, I think:  Opening problems (don't have their process and business worked out yet--these may be corrected), poorly executed food (a real worry), and cuisine choices (personal gripes that may not be relevant to others). Number 1: When we went on Friday, they were trying to switch from lunch to dinner.  The timing was slow so we could not order apps for long time.  This may be their operating plan, but I expect they will rethink it.  The happy-hour appetizer crowd would seem to be a key demographic for them. When we did order poutine, the busboy literally asked if he could take it before we had had more than one bite, and then repeatedly asked.  Even half picking it up once when it was half full.  They are trying for too-fancy service perhaps?  Perhaps the staff were over excited for opening week? Not so big a deal. However when we returned for our family reservation on Saturday, there were more basic execution problems:  several of the food items we ordered were cold, not "less warm" but outright chilled.  These were cornbread, on the point of being frozen, and baby back ribs which were cold and with their flavorful smoked fat still congealed.  Ok, some items are prepared in advance and chilled, but serving them without getting the reheat and prep correct is a rookie error. . . Then when our bill came we were charged for the dinner rather than lunch price of all our entrees, a significant difference.  The manager apologized but was surly and brusque about it. Number 2:  The food was ok, really slightly less than ok, for the most part.  For my son's fish and chips, the fries were not cooked to take advantage of the duck fat--soggy at best.  The fish was not flakey on the inside the way good fish and chips is, it was lumpy and wet.  I don't know enough about frying to describe the problem, but I know what good fried cod is supposed to be. My wife's salmon, likewise was ok but marinated so long that it was goopey on the inside.  The hopping john was good.  My ribs and cornbread were, obviously, not good, being cold. I didn't send them back because we were tightly scheduled and I just didn't feel like the hassle.  I took them home and warmed them later for family snacks.  They were ok.  The smoke was a little long for baby backs. If they want the amount of smoke flavor they are getting at they should do spare ribs to stand up to the strong flavor. Number 3:  They have made an ideological choice to tend to the bland.  Nothing, with the possible exception of the ribs, had much flavor to it.  Bun with pork belly should have some heat, vinegar,  or flavor shouldn't it?  This was my overall impression of all the food:  bland.  And they don't put salt and pepper on the table so you can't even correct those simple seasonings.  But it really was more than salt/pepper.  It was a choice to make milquetoast food that would offend no one, and thus will be great to no one. The beer somewhat follows this same pattern:  The session IPA was barely IPA, the black double IPA was a joke in that category.  They did better with the less hoppy brews.  The heavy ale (kilt spinner) was quite good and the stout was excellent.  My wife ordered a martini at the bar and the bartender wasn't sure what vermouth was or where it would be . . . Dry is one thing, but so dry that you refuse to recognize the very existence of vermouth? So overall, a regrettable two visits.  I will go back after a few months to see if things have improved and to try a few other menu items.  It could be we just chose very poorly--the sausages and charcuterie sounded good on the menu.  I expect they are trying to do too much: making sausage, pizza, smoking, charcuterie, and their own beer.  A lot to get right without it all turning out mediocre.
Good place to go for lunch or dinner.  Seems like a big early rush cause they are new, but good food and service.  Lunch portion is ok but dinner could be bigger, was still hungry when I was done with dinner. So were the 3 other people who had dinner with me.
Good times. Can be hot or miss though. Try the house made sausages or tuna tacos if they are available .
Fun. Not great, but good.  Good sausage and mashed potatoes.
Came here twice already. Once at 4pm on a Saturday, and was told that they weren't serving dinner for two hours and not seating anyone in the dining area. Ok, it's their opening week. Came on the following day, Sunday, and was immediately asked if I had a reservation. I didn't. Then I was told that there was a 45 minutes wait. They had 3 empty tables and no other people waiting. I was then told those tables were "taken". I'm pretty certain that I will never go back. Good luck with treating customers the way you did to me.
This place was great, the food, staff and ambience was outstanding I would definitely come back.
Chef Dan Crocco added brick oven pizzas to his repertoire when he moved with his crew from Brasserie 292. Here, the in house brews are complemented by a menu focusing on Dan's home made charcuterie and pub menu classics. Wonderful stuff, and lots of fun.
We just had dinner with the family here; we were greeted by an enthusiastic and very knowledgeable server, Kyle. He was pleasant, courteous and provided a wonderful dining experience. (kudos to him)! I had the smoked pork chop which was delightful. My boyfriend had the ribs which were fall of the bone, delicious!. We also chose the flight of beer which was a delightful assortment of their brews. And the desserts! We had the "dirt" and the bread pudding, outstanding! This establishment is a wonderful and much needed addition to Poughkeepsie, NY, Well Done! Can't wait to go back!
Service was lacking and meal felt rushed. They could not wait to clear our table fast bought. Has a nice atmosphere and food was pretty good. Waitress could have been a lot kinder though.
I have to say that my husband and I were very impressed with our first visit. He had pulled pork and I had a beer and cheddar sausage with mustard spaetzle and red cabbage. Great food, awesome atmosphere. Coming back to try the homemade hot dog on a pretzel roll soon!
This place is amazing. The bartenders are great and the food is right up to par. Joel is my favorite server. I have been here over 5 times and I would gladly return again. The value of the wine list is great for my girlfriends that aren't huge beer drinkers. I am l definitely a beer drinker now though. I would recommend it to all my friends!
Great service, interesting selection of food, great bar menu- very reasonable. The tuna tocos were good but the wings are out of this world. You have to try them! Beers are all brewed in house and reasonably priced!
The food, beer, atmosphere and service are all phenomenal. This place was well worth the wait
I had the pleasure of visiting Mill House while visiting relatives during the winter holiday, and I was extremely satisfied with my experience. As someone who enjoys trying out new breweries, this exceeded my expectations. The food was superb, and the beers were just as tasty and unique. I went with a group of six, and we each tried a different appetizer and entree. The fried calamari salad was perfect - and that's coming from someone who normally is very picky about calamari! They were out of the pork chop, but I was happy to try the duck breast - very moist and perfectly cooked. You will not be let down by their food! My favorite part was how the beers were masterfully infused into different menu selections, like the beer float with Velvet Panda stout, barbecue sauce made with the Kilt Spinner, and, my personal favorite, the Dark & Stormy cocktail, also made with the Velvet Panda. While their beer selection is not huge (only six beers currently), for a new establishment I'm sure they will quickly blossom. Atmosphere is cozy with an upscale twist. Perfect for craft beer fans and foodies alike.
Freakin awesome. These guys know how to run a restaurant. This is even better than Brasserie, with a different food and drink. The service was excellent. Attentive. Intuitive about attending to dishes. Complete professionals. The food was so good. Kale salad - which Im not usually a fan of was meaty, buttery and the pad thai dressing paired so perfectly. The deep fried franks red hot brussels sprouts were awesome. Maybe ask for extra  red hot powder if you really like franks. Ive never had this dish anywhere before. Unfortunately I was there for lunch during work, and unfortunately, my work had a strict no alcohol policy during work hours. If it was dinner, I would have ordered every one of their special mixed drinks on the menu. They all looked so ... So ... Drinkable. Just go.
The main draw of this place is the beer. There's a huge selection and it alls eems pretty well crafted. We arrived for our reservation and were told they were backed up. After waiting 30 minutes, our table cleared and we were able to sit. Not their fault, so it was okay. It was a busy night and we hung out by the bar. The food came quickly and was hot. The food was good - nothing rave worthy. I got the pulled pork sandwich and the bread couldn't hold up to the amount of liquid, so I ended up just eating it with a fork. Dining companion got a burger and same scenario there.
Came here for dinner. Great food. Tuna tacos are delicious as well as the deviled eggs. Wish there were some more vegetarian options! My boyfriend raved about their sausage variety. Beer selection is awesome!
Great atmosphere and very nice looking place.  I had the flat iron steak, and I was very disappointed not only in the portion, but the sides that came with it.  I literally had about 6 green beans with it, and the mashed potatoes couldn't be more than a teaspoon.  All I know is if I leave a restaurant hungry, that is a place I won't go back to. Staff was a bit slow, and one of the guys I went with had to ask for a beer 4 times before he actually got it.
Very disappointed! I have been meaning to come for quite some time and was pleasantly surprised when I came in. The place looks great! Nice decor, great bar... And then that's were it went down hill. Honestly I have tolerance but asking for beverages refilled several times when only a handful of people are at the bar is not really acceptable. My husband had his entire meal with an empty glass in front of him.  Hmmm you are at the bar for a reason. Food was mediocre at best! Strange combinations of sauces and not served hot. Sorry to say I may not be back unless the reviews say service and food gets better. I only hope the owners read the reviews and listen to them. Poughkeepsie needs new establishment like this!
It was our first time at the Mill House Brewery. The staff was great and very attentive.  We got the flight of beer and tried a few different kinds. They were all pretty tasty. I had the half rack of ribs. The ribs were smoked and finished well. They fell off the bone. The BBQ sauce was very good and had a nice spice to it at the end. My only issue with the ribs is it had a lot of cartlidge and part of the half rack was un-eatable. But that happens sometimes with the baby backs. Over all a good experience. We will definitely go back.
People let me just start by saying W.T.F. where has this place been all my life. This is exactly the kind of place i have been wanting to go to for a long time. A place where i can go with friends chill out and eat great food and enjoy drinks. That being said all i can say about the food was that if you think your going to come here and get bar food you are dead wrong. The food we tried while here was unique and off the fu#*!ng hook, and we ate a lot. We started with buffalo fried oysters w/ blue cheese aioli insane . With that we ordered these flank steak skewers with a Thai style vinaigrette on them ,daaaaamn. Second round we ordered cheese fries (not what your thinking) these cheese fries had a short rib gravy with short rib pieces all over the place,cheese curd,and jalapeno peppers, OMG need i say more. For round three we completely blew our minds. These two things we had i don"t even think there are words for this type of food. Anyway we had Moroccan spiced lamb ribs wow! and a wood fired pizza called fig and pig (take a guess)..... Wrong it was duck bacon yes duck bacon smoked mozz and balsamic i don't know what, but these chefs need to be awarded with something soon. This has to be among the best places I have ever eaten and hold on i didn't even mention the drinks, beer, awesome for beer drinkers and these wierd cocktail concoctions that are made very meticulously by the bartenders with there crazy mixer shakes and twists of this that and the other thing. I had a bourbon ice tea lemon aide thing called shinebox ( go get your fu#*ing shinebox). If you haven't been there GO NOW. If you have been there i know like me you cant wait to go back. live fast sip slow and eat mutherf@#$*ing well CHOW...
Okay, when you go to a brew pub, you expect to have good beer. That's a given. The beer here is very good. I enjoyed the Alpha, and the Velvet Panda reminds me of Mothers Milk from Keegan Ales. But to get good quality food as well is even better. The chowder was excellent and the steamed bun appetizer was superb! The wait was excellent considering how busy it is as well. Prices are fair.
Tried to go to the CIA cafe today for lunch, and we were turned away because it "normally would be open, but today is closed."  They referred us to the Mill House in Poughkeepsie which was a pleasant surprise!  We called 15 mins ahead And they held a table for us.  Really nice decor inside and excellent food!  The beer flights were delicious and reasonably priced.  Loved the pretzel stix app and the calamari salad!
So I grew up with Russian River and Lagunitas in my backyard, so I expect a lot from breweries. I know what they can be. I have not been impressed by many on the east coast. I've come to expect weak session beers with little flavor and little imagination. That said, I was impressed with Mill House's beer. Their most potent beer is still only a 7.7%, but they were good. We had the Kilt Spinner (win), the Velvet Panda (win), Alpha and Old Steady RyePA (win, win). Not blow your socks off, but all good. Word of caution, the Old Steady tastes like a grapefruit pale ale. But great for hot days. We didn't try the food, but the pizzas from the wood oven looked tasty. Con: Busy busy busy. That's not a bad thing for business but be aware that in the bar you will be on top of other people and the wait without reservation for a table will be at least 40 minutes. That said, I will still come here again. Challenge to the brewers: Brew out of the comfort zone, push the 8% and 9% barrier, do some oaked versions (Kilt Spinner would be amazing oaked), and cross the Belgian line.
I really wanted to love this place.  Actually, I thought the food was decent and the atmosphere was nice.  They clearly spent a lot of time and money on their decor down to the little things.  As with most good or half-way decent things in this area, this restaurant will probably keep this standard for about six months and then decline.   I had the steak which was decent.  Small portions and they covered it with that crunchy onion crap.  I don't like my steak already sliced, and it was way overdone at that when I had asked for medium rare.  Other dishes at our table were the pizza (simple, and huge personal pie portion), the pork chops (pretty good but bland), the wings (not a fan... they were way too breaded and not crispy enough.  I've definitely had better.  Best wings in the world are at Southern Sun in Boulder, Colorado... anyone who knows wings know this is true!!!),  and the ribs (pretty good surprisingly!). We also had a beer milkshake at our table which was pushed on by our waiter... little did he know that I am not even 21... and I am also recovering from a drinking problem.  Not his problem at all, and that wasn't really my issue with our waiter.  It did bother me that he kept injecting himself in our conversation every time he came to our table, but whatever. Studying business management concentrating in the bar and restaurant industry and having tended bar and waitressed since I was 16, I have a rough idea of the way things should be done... especially when it comes to hospitality.  I never make it a big deal if a waiter is a bit short with me because I know what it's like to work in the restaurant world.  However... being able to give great customer service is NEVER something that you should fail to pursue.   Depending on the establishment, trash and small pieces of paper are sometimes left on the table even when dishes are cleared.  I'm talking about small sugar packets or straw endings.  Our waiter, Joel (I specifically looked up and down the check to find his name) reached over my plate while I was still eating in order to grab some trash that I would have happily put on my plate when I was done.  There is NO EXCEPTION for reaching across a customer EVEN IF THEY AREEE FINISHED!!!  Leave the trash on the table!! No one wants to be that close to your armpits... jesus.   So politely, I said something to the extent of "do you have suggestion cards?" I know they are a new place, and new places LOVE their customers to tell them how the service was.  As all restaurants/bars should... but instead Joel told me that there were no cards, and that he would be glad to hear my suggestion.  NO OFFENSE JOEL... BUT ARE YOU THE EFFING OWNER?  After the armpit incident I kind of assumed that this guy was a complete tool, but how he handled my suggestion was astonishing and I would have fired this guy on the spot.  I told him that perhaps "cash pots" would be a better alternative to reaching across the table.  "Cash pots" are perfect for restaurants that aren't laid out properly to completely clear the table without disturbing the customers' experience.  He told me that there's a bar in Saugerties that throws their trash on the floor, but that's not the type of aura that the Mill House Brewing Company wants to portray... wtf?  I didn't even say anything remotely close to that.  Having my suggestion compared to trash being disposed right on the floor was insulting.  He told me that my idea wasn't good and that their restaurant was far too good for such a suggestion.  I guess they put armpits to the face before positive customer experience/suggestions............I brushed it off because I have better crap to spend my time and energy on... but talk about terrible and rude service.   It's too bad, because I would love to have a place to bring my colleagues and family.  I just got engaged and considered having my engagement party here with 50+ people... NO THANK YOU!   Kind of figures though, I guess the same guys that own the Brasserie also own this place.  I got REALLY sick from the Brasserie's crab(p) omelet a few months back, and I vowed to be much more careful with my food choices since.  Just because a restaurant LOOKS nice, doesn't mean the quality is really there.  It's too bad because the partial owners who did the aesthetics on the place did a great job at the Mill House Brewing Company... I hope they work out better management.   Note--- to the person who said that they were asked to leave a good hour before their table was needed.  It happened to a couple behind us as well.  TALK ABOUT TERRIBLE MANAGEMENT!  Management should have the mindset to have REPEAT CUSTOMERS rather than so many negative experiences.  To disrupt someone's dinner to tell them that they need to leave is appalling to me, especially since our experience with the same incident occurred when several (5 or 6) tables were available right in our area of the restaurant! I might be back to try the food again... maybe.
Great decor...nice setup...great idea...crap food, small portions that you can not customize. We asked for polenta instead of of mashed potatoes and the server said I don't think we can do that but I'll check. Next thing you know I had potatoes next to an over cooked burger. We had someone on a strict diet that asked for veggies instead on something that was more expensive and they didn't do it. Each dish came out separately and the last two dishes, one being mine waited an additional 15 minutes! Make the customers happy not pissed off and neglected. Food was 4/10 at most and over priced. Very bland and small portions. Sucks cause the building is beautiful but don't let that fool you. The beer was decent that's about it. Get new staff or something. There's potential to be a good place but your farrrrrrr from being good at this point. You put a lot of money into that place make it seem like it. It's a shame. Too bad it's still not the panda house, at least they knew how to run an establishment. My guess is that anyone that have 5 stars is a friend if the owner or family.
I have been here at least a half dozen times since it opened and Mill House has unfailingly blown me away. The atmosphere is classy and modern, which makes me pleasantly surprised that the prices are quite reasonable. It's also refreshing to see the manager involved in all areas of service from greeting at the hostess stand, to running our food, to seeing how everything turned out. The food is superb and a nice variety (even for vegetarians). I love the local cheeses and the pan seared salmon. Also, even though it is a brewery, the mixed drinks are off the chart. My girlfriends and I love the dark and stormy! The only reason to fret is that the place is packed on the weekends so a reservation on Friday or Saturday night is a good idea. But hey, even when it's packed, the bar is geniusly designed to accommodate a large number of people so you can relax and have drinks while you wait.
The former Chinese restaurant, Mill House Panda, has been very nicely remodeled and expanded in this new incarnation as a bustling brew pub. The ambiance is convivial. I was told that the chef at Brasserie 292 is behind this more eclectic casual cuisine and it might be indicated by the graphics of the menu which strongly resembles that of the brasserie in format but not offerings.  The use of a few large banquettes also reminds of Brasserie 292.  I went recently for lunch with two colleagues and the consensus on this first visit was that the beer is very good, an offering of five or six made there of various strengths and colors.  I very much liked the flavor of the IPA they make.  The service was very attentive, almost doggedly so, so that deep conversations were frequently interrupted and trains of thought lost as one reassured our server that all was well.  This curmudgeonly gripe aside, it's better than the alternative of no interest by the server.  So, then there was the food--the menu suffers from that occasional hyperbole that masks a certain mediocrity.  For example, the  "Crespelle-Parmigiano and thyme crepe filled with eggplant caponata, smoked provolone, baby broccoli rabe, San Marzano tomato-pepper sauce" is your basic eggplant parmigiana.  Ok but not special.  However with some relief I can report that the "fish and chips" were fish and chips. The salads, however, were nicely thought out.  Since they are only recently opened, the jury is out and awaits further trials and, one hopes, stars.
My significant other and I visited this brewery today and were blown away.   I read quite a few negatives reviews on Yelp, and all I can think is that the restaurant may have had some problems when they first opened up, but none of that was evident today.  We arrived around  4:30 and the place was packed.  The space is absolutely beautiful and everyone seemed to be having a great time.  We were there for a light dinner so ordered the Pig & Fig pizza....it was fabulous, with fresh figs and duck bacon.  My significant other ordered a flight of beer and enjoyed all of the brews,  and ended up taking home a growler of his favorite.  It was tough to pick which dessert to try, but we decided on the banana cream pie which was absolutely delicious. We were so impressed with the food, service and atmosphere that we know it is one of our new favorites.  The menu is unique, and it's a fun atmosphere.  Give it a try; I can't imagine anyone being disappointed.  A great addition to downtown Poughkeepsie.
Sat down at the bar on my visit. The bartender was very kind, remembered all of our names, and knew his stuff! Got the flight to try out their beers and every single one is delicious. I had the fish tacos. They had absolutely no fishy taste, were really crisp and yummy. Boyfriend had the pulled pork sliders. They were dry but had good flavor. Will be coming back to eat a full meal very soon! Oh and the atmosphere was great, didn't even feel like you were in Poughkeepsie, let alone right on the arterial.
Well appointed, well renovated eatery.  Been there a few times.  Food is good.  Today we went for lunch and the gal gave us the rundown on the lunch specials.  Ordered the chicken bacon sausage with shredded lettuce.  Disappointing-lacked flavor was really rather small portion-looked somewhat like a cheap hot dog-too big a bun and about 3-4 small pieces of lettuce.  Here is the kicker....we got the bill and it was $16.00!!!  The server-when asked if this was a mistake-said oh-I should have given you the prices on the specials.  When ordering a lunch special-the guest will compare it to the burgers and sandwiches and align the cost with those items.  I called the owner later, Chris, who explained for several minutes that their sausages are hand made----blah blah blah...and said the servers should provide prices. Wanted my email so we could converse.  Don't know about you but was looking for more than an email friendship.  Hopefully they will provide a better customer experience to the next patron-but I didnt get that sense.
Fun. Not great, but good.  Good sausage and mashed potatoes.
This place was great, the food, staff and ambience was outstanding I would definitely come back.
We just had dinner with the family here; we were greeted by an enthusiastic and very knowledgeable server, Kyle. He was pleasant, courteous and provided a wonderful dining experience. (kudos to him)! I had the smoked pork chop which was delightful. My boyfriend had the ribs which were fall of the bone, delicious!. We also chose the flight of beer which was a delightful assortment of their brews. And the desserts! We had the "dirt" and the bread pudding, outstanding! This establishment is a wonderful and much needed addition to Poughkeepsie, NY, Well Done! Can't wait to go back!
I have to say that my husband and I were very impressed with our first visit. He had pulled pork and I had a beer and cheddar sausage with mustard spaetzle and red cabbage. Great food, awesome atmosphere. Coming back to try the homemade hot dog on a pretzel roll soon!
Great service, interesting selection of food, great bar menu- very reasonable. The tuna tocos were good but the wings are out of this world. You have to try them! Beers are all brewed in house and reasonably priced!
I had the pleasure of visiting Mill House while visiting relatives during the winter holiday, and I was extremely satisfied with my experience. As someone who enjoys trying out new breweries, this exceeded my expectations. The food was superb, and the beers were just as tasty and unique. I went with a group of six, and we each tried a different appetizer and entree. The fried calamari salad was perfect - and that's coming from someone who normally is very picky about calamari! They were out of the pork chop, but I was happy to try the duck breast - very moist and perfectly cooked. You will not be let down by their food! My favorite part was how the beers were masterfully infused into different menu selections, like the beer float with Velvet Panda stout, barbecue sauce made with the Kilt Spinner, and, my personal favorite, the Dark & Stormy cocktail, also made with the Velvet Panda. While their beer selection is not huge (only six beers currently), for a new establishment I'm sure they will quickly blossom. Atmosphere is cozy with an upscale twist. Perfect for craft beer fans and foodies alike.
Came here for dinner. Great food. Tuna tacos are delicious as well as the deviled eggs. Wish there were some more vegetarian options! My boyfriend raved about their sausage variety. Beer selection is awesome!
Very disappointed! I have been meaning to come for quite some time and was pleasantly surprised when I came in. The place looks great! Nice decor, great bar... And then that's were it went down hill. Honestly I have tolerance but asking for beverages refilled several times when only a handful of people are at the bar is not really acceptable. My husband had his entire meal with an empty glass in front of him.  Hmmm you are at the bar for a reason. Food was mediocre at best! Strange combinations of sauces and not served hot. Sorry to say I may not be back unless the reviews say service and food gets better. I only hope the owners read the reviews and listen to them. Poughkeepsie needs new establishment like this!
It was our first time at the Mill House Brewery. The staff was great and very attentive.  We got the flight of beer and tried a few different kinds. They were all pretty tasty. I had the half rack of ribs. The ribs were smoked and finished well. They fell off the bone. The BBQ sauce was very good and had a nice spice to it at the end. My only issue with the ribs is it had a lot of cartlidge and part of the half rack was un-eatable. But that happens sometimes with the baby backs. Over all a good experience. We will definitely go back.
People let me just start by saying W.T.F. where has this place been all my life. This is exactly the kind of place i have been wanting to go to for a long time. A place where i can go with friends chill out and eat great food and enjoy drinks. That being said all i can say about the food was that if you think your going to come here and get bar food you are dead wrong. The food we tried while here was unique and off the fu#*!ng hook, and we ate a lot. We started with buffalo fried oysters w/ blue cheese aioli insane . With that we ordered these flank steak skewers with a Thai style vinaigrette on them ,daaaaamn. Second round we ordered cheese fries (not what your thinking) these cheese fries had a short rib gravy with short rib pieces all over the place,cheese curd,and jalapeno peppers, OMG need i say more. For round three we completely blew our minds. These two things we had i don"t even think there are words for this type of food. Anyway we had Moroccan spiced lamb ribs wow! and a wood fired pizza called fig and pig (take a guess)..... Wrong it was duck bacon yes duck bacon smoked mozz and balsamic i don't know what, but these chefs need to be awarded with something soon. This has to be among the best places I have ever eaten and hold on i didn't even mention the drinks, beer, awesome for beer drinkers and these wierd cocktail concoctions that are made very meticulously by the bartenders with there crazy mixer shakes and twists of this that and the other thing. I had a bourbon ice tea lemon aide thing called shinebox ( go get your fu#*ing shinebox). If you haven't been there GO NOW. If you have been there i know like me you cant wait to go back. live fast sip slow and eat mutherf@#$*ing well CHOW...
Okay, when you go to a brew pub, you expect to have good beer. That's a given. The beer here is very good. I enjoyed the Alpha, and the Velvet Panda reminds me of Mothers Milk from Keegan Ales. But to get good quality food as well is even better. The chowder was excellent and the steamed bun appetizer was superb! The wait was excellent considering how busy it is as well. Prices are fair.
Tried to go to the CIA cafe today for lunch, and we were turned away because it "normally would be open, but today is closed."  They referred us to the Mill House in Poughkeepsie which was a pleasant surprise!  We called 15 mins ahead And they held a table for us.  Really nice decor inside and excellent food!  The beer flights were delicious and reasonably priced.  Loved the pretzel stix app and the calamari salad!
So I grew up with Russian River and Lagunitas in my backyard, so I expect a lot from breweries. I know what they can be. I have not been impressed by many on the east coast. I've come to expect weak session beers with little flavor and little imagination. That said, I was impressed with Mill House's beer. Their most potent beer is still only a 7.7%, but they were good. We had the Kilt Spinner (win), the Velvet Panda (win), Alpha and Old Steady RyePA (win, win). Not blow your socks off, but all good. Word of caution, the Old Steady tastes like a grapefruit pale ale. But great for hot days. We didn't try the food, but the pizzas from the wood oven looked tasty. Con: Busy busy busy. That's not a bad thing for business but be aware that in the bar you will be on top of other people and the wait without reservation for a table will be at least 40 minutes. That said, I will still come here again. Challenge to the brewers: Brew out of the comfort zone, push the 8% and 9% barrier, do some oaked versions (Kilt Spinner would be amazing oaked), and cross the Belgian line.
I really wanted to love this place.  Actually, I thought the food was decent and the atmosphere was nice.  They clearly spent a lot of time and money on their decor down to the little things.  As with most good or half-way decent things in this area, this restaurant will probably keep this standard for about six months and then decline.   I had the steak which was decent.  Small portions and they covered it with that crunchy onion crap.  I don't like my steak already sliced, and it was way overdone at that when I had asked for medium rare.  Other dishes at our table were the pizza (simple, and huge personal pie portion), the pork chops (pretty good but bland), the wings (not a fan... they were way too breaded and not crispy enough.  I've definitely had better.  Best wings in the world are at Southern Sun in Boulder, Colorado... anyone who knows wings know this is true!!!),  and the ribs (pretty good surprisingly!). We also had a beer milkshake at our table which was pushed on by our waiter... little did he know that I am not even 21... and I am also recovering from a drinking problem.  Not his problem at all, and that wasn't really my issue with our waiter.  It did bother me that he kept injecting himself in our conversation every time he came to our table, but whatever. Studying business management concentrating in the bar and restaurant industry and having tended bar and waitressed since I was 16, I have a rough idea of the way things should be done... especially when it comes to hospitality.  I never make it a big deal if a waiter is a bit short with me because I know what it's like to work in the restaurant world.  However... being able to give great customer service is NEVER something that you should fail to pursue.   Depending on the establishment, trash and small pieces of paper are sometimes left on the table even when dishes are cleared.  I'm talking about small sugar packets or straw endings.  Our waiter, Joel (I specifically looked up and down the check to find his name) reached over my plate while I was still eating in order to grab some trash that I would have happily put on my plate when I was done.  There is NO EXCEPTION for reaching across a customer EVEN IF THEY AREEE FINISHED!!!  Leave the trash on the table!! No one wants to be that close to your armpits... jesus.   So politely, I said something to the extent of "do you have suggestion cards?" I know they are a new place, and new places LOVE their customers to tell them how the service was.  As all restaurants/bars should... but instead Joel told me that there were no cards, and that he would be glad to hear my suggestion.  NO OFFENSE JOEL... BUT ARE YOU THE EFFING OWNER?  After the armpit incident I kind of assumed that this guy was a complete tool, but how he handled my suggestion was astonishing and I would have fired this guy on the spot.  I told him that perhaps "cash pots" would be a better alternative to reaching across the table.  "Cash pots" are perfect for restaurants that aren't laid out properly to completely clear the table without disturbing the customers' experience.  He told me that there's a bar in Saugerties that throws their trash on the floor, but that's not the type of aura that the Mill House Brewing Company wants to portray... wtf?  I didn't even say anything remotely close to that.  Having my suggestion compared to trash being disposed right on the floor was insulting.  He told me that my idea wasn't good and that their restaurant was far too good for such a suggestion.  I guess they put armpits to the face before positive customer experience/suggestions............I brushed it off because I have better crap to spend my time and energy on... but talk about terrible and rude service.   It's too bad, because I would love to have a place to bring my colleagues and family.  I just got engaged and considered having my engagement party here with 50+ people...

Awesome! A bunch of us took the train up to Poughkeepsie from NYC, for a long ride in the Catskills. One of the guys found this place online and we agreed to eat there after. 112 miles later, and we were on the edge of bonking and f**king starving (and much in need of a beer). Although it was only 5:30 as we got close to town, someone thought we should call ahead to see if we needed to book. Alas - fully booked! We rolled up anyway just to check, but there wasn't anywhere to leave our bikes so we were pretty sure it was a no-go. One of the guys stuck his head in just in case - turned out the manager was a fellow bike enthusiast - he led us round back and let us put our bikes in the brewery - right between the tanks. He then sorted us out with 5 seats at the bar. Food and beer were excellent, and the service was second-to-none. The place is an absolute gem
Nice place, very inviting space with plenty of seating options around the bar downstairs or upstairs in the dining room. Sat at the bar after a nice day of walking the bridge and enjoyed a flight of their beers. The beers were the highlight. They had a nice variety with distinct tasting notes to each, good enough to get me back but the food was lacking or my choice of food was lacking. Fish n Chips came with one ok size piece of fish :( (batter was nice and light so i'll give them credit there) but colesaw was dry and flavorless and the mountain of fries were OK. Maybe sticking with the higher regarded sandwiches is the way to go, but was it wasn't a good first impression on food. The service was inconsistent as it took a good 15 minutes to get any greeting at the bar and then it picked up a bit after that. It's worth another try when heading upstate.
I really want to love this place, really I do. I have been to the MHBC twice now, and both times I walked away feeling "meh." What I like: I really love what they did with the interior. The restaurant is warm and inviting. Dining is intimate and cozy. I enjoyed the pretzel app both times I was there. It is delicious, especially with the side of spicy mustard. A wonderful treat on a cool night. I like the beer. Yes, the beer is good. What I did not like: Both of my meals were not that great. On my first visit I had a burger. I ordered it med-well and it came out over well. The burger was greasier than I liked too. It wasn't horrible, but I expected it to be better. The second time I went I ordered the salmon and again, WAY over cooked and no flavor. It was actually pretty gross. Maybe I shouldn't have ordered a salmon from a brewery, but I did not want another mediocre burger. I took a few bites of the salmon and could not find the appetite to finish it. Conclusion: Beer is good and food is okay. Maybe I will be back, but mostly for the beer.
Hip and fresh interior.  Creative menu, friendly staff, great mimosas.
This was our second visit to Millhouse--the first was an event during Queen City Pride earlier this year, which was a ton of fun--and I have to say they nail everything from the decor and ambiance to the food. We had a reservation and were celebrating my birthday. They have a very attentive waitstaff, fantastic craft beer, and the Ribeye melted in my mouth. Try the Buffalo Sprouts for a tasty take on "Buffalo Wings" that are vegetarian friendly as an appetizer. We will definitely be returning and bringing our friends along next time.
When in Rome as the saying goes! In that note order some type of the sausage. We were a party of 7 and 6 of us did. It is freshly made and delicious! We did have a laugh about the 'brioche' rolls on the menu which turned out to be a hot dog roll. Derrick our server was very knowledgable. Franks for the memories!
I came here with my wife after doing the walk across the Hudson.   My wife ordered the fig and pig pizza and I ordered one of their chicken sausages, which are all made in-house.  Both were delicious.  Definitely going to have to try their other pizzas and sausages. Their beer selection was also very nice.  I tried one of their stronger beers (9%), forget the name of it, but it was really good, kind of tasted like Chimay.   The service was very friendly and quick.  Our server stopped by multiple times to check on us and made some great recommendations. Definitely coming back here in the near future.
Amazing Food and Beverage in Poughkeepsie! The interior design is so nicely done. The food is executed perfectly and the service is on point! Definitely a "must try" when you are in Poughkeepsie! 5 Stars!
Oh. My. God. This place was stunning from the moment we walked in the door!  So I made a reservation for 3 on a Saturday afternoon because we were in Poughkeepsie for a wedding (which was awesome).  I picked this place because the BF loves craft beer and the reviews were great.  It. was. awesome!  Our server was knowledgable and made great recommendations... we were gonna get burgers but thankfully went for the Bratwurst instead, along with the Buffalo Brussels (You MUST try them!!!).  From the Dark and Stormy cocktail to the Banana Cream Pie, the comfy booth and the bustling atmosphere, I would absolutely take the train up to Poughkeepsie just to eat here again.  We loved it!
Get new hostesses! They were rude and not accommodating. Both having horrible attitudes. After we were finally seated 15 minutes later. There was multiple open tables. (You might want to train them on when to reserve tables to reservations when a table sits open for an hour. That's money out of the owners pocket). We sat at our table for another 10-15 minutes without a server coming over to talk to us. The bartender ended up having to grab one for us. Our server that we finally got was nice and was quick to help. The food tasted great, but the size of the kielbasa meal was small for the cost. Overall good food, bad hostesses!!!!
This restaurant is one of my favorite pit stops whenever we visit the Hudson Valley. The staff are all friendly and the food and beers are so good! I've also heard from friends that the cocktails are excellent so I will try those the next time I stop by! This weekend, we had the brussels sprouts (with buffalo powder...YUM), the KO wings, the mini-fest special (a board of 3 types of sausages with sauces to accompany each one), and the pulled pork sandwich with shoestring fries. Everything was flavorful and unique. Last time, I had the fig and pig pizza and the panda poutine and both were excellent too! We also had kids in our party and their meals came with ice cream! As for beers, we loved the Kold One and Old Steady. We even took a growler of the Old Steady home with us. And even though we were super full, we ordered the Dirt for dessert. It was so delicious and HUGE! I could not finish it by myself! I only wish I lived closer so I could stop by more often. I heard they'll be at the Hudson Valley Brew Festival so maybe I'll make another trip up to enjoy the festivities!
Friends and I came here for drinks and finger foods to celebrate the #JavalySmithWedding. (Does Yelp use hahstags?) The beers I tried were delicious, some with particularly interesting stories behind them, and the bar staff was friendly and knowledgeable. The food was good, too. Would definitely recommend to anyone in the area looking to get a beer.
Came here for my mom's birthday dinner. I am not a beer drinker, so I can't give my opinion on that but the other people in my party seemed to enjoy it. First off, the popcorn is outstanding. The service is also very good, I must have had my water refilled 6 or 7 times! I had the all American burger for dinner and it was fantastic. For dessert I had brown butter cake with buttermilk gelato. The portion was smaller but upon eating it I was filled up quick. It was rich and decadent. I will certainly come here again.
Love this place!  The food and the beer were delicious. We had the Mergiez Sausage and Thai Sausage (Bahn Mi) and they were very tasty.  The Buffalo Fried Brussels Sprouts, from the bar menu, were not as good as I had hoped but we still ate the entire plate.  Also the "flight" of beers- which allows you to taste test different brews- is definitely worth it.  The service was good.  And the place looks great!  Definitely want to try it again.
We ate on the outside patio, though it overlooks the parking lot it was quite pleasant to be outdoor on a sunny day. Waiters were very in the ball, came right away with glass of water and silverware. The sausages display at the entrance makes it look like a deli! The Bahn Mi sandwich was good, though not quite the real thing. The jalapeño mayo was a nice touch, but not exactly "Thai ".  My friend had the burger with delicious fries. All in all I would definitely go back as the extended menus is very appealing. Also for the beer lover in you, you will have many choices.
Great bahn-mi with specialized sausages made on site. Although it was the most expensive bahn-mi ($16) that I ever had, it was worth every penny. The size was sufficient for two to share. We also had fig and "pig" pizza which was excellent. The dining room was lively on a Sunday afternoon. On our way out, we bought more sausages from the restaurant and grilled them at home. They were very good.
What a fantastic meal! I found Millhouse via Yelp and the pictures and reviews were enticing enough to give it a try-- and happy we did. At first, i thought we were headed in the wrong direction given the surroundings but with much surprise this hidden gem was extremely welcoming when we entered the parking lot. We had a reservation and although we showed up late, we were seated within minutes without a problem. The ambience is trendy, rustic and warm. Everyone was polite and checked in with us regularly. For appetizers, we ordered the flank steak skewers and panda Poutine. Both phenomenal. The skewers were cooked to perfection with some sesame aioli I wish I could jar and take home. The Poutine was served with melted curds, short rib gravy and jalapeños. Yes. It's sounds as good as it was. For dinner, my boyfriend ordered the bratwurst served with spatzel and I the kielbasa served with homemade garlic pierogis. Awesome sauce. Dessert- oh, we went there. I won't go into details because you must try for yourselves. "Dirt" and I believe it's the brown butter pie. YUM.
This is the third time I've come to this restaurant and I'm not impressed. It's now 8pm on a Sunday and they have already closed their kitchen?!?! I'm pretty sure 8pm is still considered dinner time AND it's restaurant week!!!!!! There's at least 40 people in here right now so the excuse of being slow is bs. Absolutely ridiculous!!!
A couple of weeks back, I participated in a celebratory lunch here with seven co-workers.  I work right in the back of MHBC so I was privy to all of the construction taking place all summer long.  No expense was spared in the transformation and revitalization of this nice, new place- the former Mill House Panda, which I also patronized.  The construction materials, overall design and decorations are really very chic and trendy and the ambiance evokes a warm, inviting feel from the moment you enter the building. I only wish that the management imbued the same good feelings.   Our male server was very amiable and wrote down all of our choices, of which there were a couple of minor special requests made, but he did question my choice of dressing that I wanted to switch to on the wedge salad that I ordered.  I don't like when servers do that because you get the impression that they are ambiguously criticizing your tastes, which is not professional at all.   We all like what we like.  It's just a matter of personal preference- no need for wait staff to question it. Anyway, after 6 of our plates were served by the young man that took our order, one of us was left waiting for several extra minutes for the last dinner to be served.  When it finally came out, it was delivered by the manager, not our original server.   At that point, three of us asked him about our dishes.  One of my co-workers had ordered fresh-cut jalapenos for her pizza.  When she asked the manger where they were (because the server had indeed written that down) he asked her in a slightly critical tone "What do you want them for?".  Ha!  None of your business, buddy!  Because she asked for them, that's why!  Why would he question her like you would a small child?  Then he told her that MHBC doesn't have fresh jalapenos available!  He didn't have a pleasant tone at all and that came across very obviously. Then, my other co-worker (whose son is a CIA grad and she caters private dinner parties) asked about her Fennel and Apple Slaw.  She was expecting a slaw made dominantly of those two items, but her side was mostly cabbage- to the point that no apple or fennel could even be detected due to the naturally over-powering flavor of cabbage.  After she inquired with the manager about this, he informed her he would comp the slaw for her, but then proceeded to give her a lecture about what constitutes a "slaw"!     Simply put, this manager had an arrogant air about him and was not very helpful in assisting us. Unless he was just having a bad personal day, I'm thinking he is in the wrong business.   Oh yes, and the table's comments about all of the dishes?  "Pretty good" to "Eh".   MHBC is very expensive for lunch, also.
Loved salad with calamari.  Special hamburger was complicated but it worked.  Would definitely try it again the next time we're in the area.
Had better. When we arrived we were seated at an awkward table. When my fiancé asked the hostess if we could have a different table she said we could not move because they were booked. Yet, there were many tables open all around the restaurant. Unless each reservation specifically requested those tables then I don't understand why she couldn't rearrange the seating. So we sat at the bar. Beautiful place. Food was decent, nothing mind blowing. It came out quickly and was hot. Service was pretty good. No hurry to go back.
Killer killer meal - great atmosphere, awesome service, top notch modern food.... Awesome beer. Best thing we had was sage and garlic house made sausage... Wow!! Went for lunch and will back again soon.
The food and beer is exceptional at this craft brewery and restaurant - way better than you can usually buy at these prices. I had the garlic & sage house made sausage over mashed potatoes and greens - outstanding. Beers are great. I recommend their Kold One and the cream ale. Our whole group walked out happy tonight. Definitely eat at Mill House Brewing Company!!! One of the best new Hudson Valley restaurants for sure!
I'm only giving it four stars because I didn't try any of the food, although the menu looked great and there looked like some vegan options. The beer however is incredible, there is a a good range of different styles of beers and the brewmaster nails them all. Oh and he's extremely friendly, we happened to catch him while he was refilling his drink and discussed the brew process with my brother (whose a new home brewer) and recommended a nice route to the rest of the places on our stop. He had mentioned being friends with some of the other brewers. You can try 6 of their beers for 10 dollars (which is reasonable...but I've seen better deals) especially because you have to leave out one of their beers. :( The bartender was nice enough to let us try the one we left out because it was that good. The service was really great, and the decor is beautiful. This is the perfect place for after work drinks or a nice Saturday night date. I wish I lived closer.
I have been to Mill House twice now, and feel comfortable with 4 stars. Very solid food, albeit mostly "upscale" plays off traditional bar food. Bar pies with flair, interesting sausages, burgers...etc. Have been similarly impressed with the beers - all solid, but not blow me away awesome. Let's go with super solid. My daughter is a huge fan of the All American burger, might be her favorite burger in the HV. My biggest beef with MHBC is this: both times I have been there, the server has started out by telling me what they are out of that night. And the list is usually long, and somewhat incomprehensible from a restaurant management perspective: how does the kitchen manager fail to stock the fridge with enough figs? Kielbasa? And this disease also seems to hit the brewmaster: each time I have been there, they've been out of at least one of the house brews. Disappointing, because it's really hard to have a flight of their stuff when one or two aren't available! The space is great, and judging from the difficulty getting a reservation they are doing well out of the gate. Let's hope they flatten out some of the bumps with stock and stick around.
This place seriously has it all. I'm bummed that this opened after I graduated from Marist - but everytime I come back; I make sure this is most definitely on my itinerary. BEERS ON BEERS! - this has such a great and wide selection of home-brewed beers. You'll certainly find a beer you like here. FOOD - the food is great; but the most amazing thing is the Fig pizza; holy moly; I usually never order pizza from a restaurant just bc I just feel pizza is usually just pizza; but this makes your taste buds burn with passion. ATMOSPHERE - one of the trendiest spots in Poughkeepsie; the exposed brick walls are marvelously warm and just hugs you into a sense of comfort. TIPS - try the flight of beer! It's a great bang for your buck and you get to try out so many kinds; its also quite fun to get a giant plank of beers in front of you. Also, make sure you make a reservation as this place is bumping.
Fantastic food! A little pricey for the portion size but delicious! The bartenders (2) were less than friendly lacking any sense of humor or warmth. We were in and out because of it.
The homemade sausages are out of this world. I picked up some of their homemade bacon at the beer, bourbon, and bacon festival and it was sooo delicious. The price of the brews are incredibly reasonable. The beers taste better than the other breweries in the area. The only downfall is they have a typically long wait.
How could this place not be a solid five stars?!  This place is awesome, with great everything. Their beer (and the shot pairings) are great (and already award winning).  The food is creative, delicious and addictive.  He atmosphere is superb - everything I love. The service was impeccable, with careful attention and suggestions.   I cannot wait to come back here as soon as possible.  Love it!
Highly recommended from a couple of family members so we gave it a shot. The restaurant seems misplaced in Poughkeepsie but aside from that no major complaints. It also doesn't seem favorable for kids- no kids placemats to color or anything like that. The food was great and the service was fast! We had the soft pretzels, and deviled eggs to start. The kids had kids cheeseburger ($12) and chicken fingers ($12) good food but def overpriced by $6 each. My wife had the American burger and I had the porky burger based on the waiters strong recommendations. He nailed it! We will be back for sure.
Poorest of service. This place is run by ill-tempered children. Acceptable beer though. (But you'll have to wait 20 minutes for your beer to get to the table.)
I had a very interesting dining experience here. This review would've turned out differently with some better management skills. The beer was enjoyable and the atmosphere was out of this world but don't ask too many questions. We came across an issue with an entree and it was handled in a very unprofessional manner. The waitress was curt when handling it and the management really couldn't be bothered. Then we were told at 4:45 that they needed our table for a 6:30 reservation. I thought that was about an hour too early to give us a warning. It doesn't really give off a welcoming feeling! It was very disappointing considering we were there testing it out for a Christmas party later in the month.  For a restaurant just opening it doesn't seem as if they are too concerned with making their customers happy.
I really wish I could give 3.5 stars but since I have to round I think I'll round down to a 3. Service was slow, we waited 45 mins for a seat even though we had a reservation and 10 mins for a drink after we were seated. Food was mediocre but fairly unique options. The best part about this place is the people it appeals to. It truly brought in a beautiful fun crowd in the middle of a pretty impoverish area.     Great for all types of parties or a bar side dinner.
Food: The food was very well done. Our large group got a Sausage sampler, which included 2 links of each menu sausage. They were clearly fresh/house made and everyone at the table had their favorites. Panda Poutine, Buffalo Oysters, Manilla Clams...all well liked. The star of the show was clearly the fig and pig, very well thought and just bursting with tremendous flavor. Charcuterie was slightly undersized and the meats were not up to par when it comes to the NY/NYC region and it's ability to provide the best in Italian. Beer: Not bad and a reasonable price. The only dark beer- Velvet Panda, had some caffeine/coffee notes...I don't do coffee with my beer and wasn't aware that was coming. SERVICE: This is where the Mill House fell far behind. Our reservation was 20-30 minutes late in being sat...that is OK, but usually we get a round of beers or some small gesture. The waitress seemed CONFUSED that we wanted to treat the menu and our meal like a "tasting" menu, ie; just keep ordering and eating. I explained it to her several times that we were going to just keep ordering food and eating....that shouldn't be too confusing but she seemed slightly not OK with that, which makes no sense to me. She didn't know the menu very well either and really didn't give us the foodie type info we like getting. At the end of the night...as the restaurant wound down the open air kitchen began to clean and BLAST rap music...that is right folks...30 million (whatever it is) in renovations, wood finishings, a glass enclosed brewery and your favorite racial slur filled....rap. They turned the music UP a notch and took the quality of their restaurant DOWN a few. Not acceptable on any level especially when you factor in that one of the OWNERS was right there with them. Very odd. We were all VERY surprised. The kitchen staff were friendly and having "fun" cleaning but this isn't a hip hop night at the bar and I really don't want non-dinner music...at my dinners. I will be back because the food and atmosphere are very nice and service was not horrible just a bit spotty/confusing.
The place has been open only a little more than a week, yet I've found myself here three times already and a fourth time is planned for this week. I've enjoyed small plates at the bar, lunch and also dinner - and not only has all of the food been fresh and tasty - the service is always  fantastic!  I'm so impressed with how knowledgable the waitstaff is about the food and beer, especially for a new place with a large menu.  And they are also super attentive and friendly. The past 2 visits I've had the Porchetta Sandwich with Belgian Fries - the ciabatta bread was flaky, crusty and had just the right amount of crunch, very fresh. I've also had the fish tacos, local burrata plate and the pulled pork sliders on mini brioche rolls.  Outstanding! This is now my neighboorhood go-to spot - the equivalent of Cheers, but with much better food.  Can't wait to work my way through every dish on the menu.
I heard they were new in town, and since my coworker and I were visiting, we decided to check it out. The panda poutine is delicious, even though I'm not sure if it being called panda is accurate. It wasn't exactly black and white, but no worries about the name, still good! I also had the Moroccan spiced lamb ribs which were good, possibly a tad sweet. The Sea and Swine was a good idea except the citrus scented pork belly was way too salty. My coworker got a special of the day which was a buffalo oyster sandwich with fries. He said it wasn't bad. I guess I'd expect better tasting food from a restaurant that looks so popular. That or I didn't order the right items.
Ordered buffalo oysters per review. Did not disappoint. The fig/pig pizza was amazing. I brew my own beer so I am always looking for new styles to try. Beer flight is the way to go. The variety was fantastic. Would recommend this to anyone looking for a good meal with interesting taste profiles. If you love beer, this place won't disappoint. And the wait staff did an outstanding job.
