I've been staying in the same cabin for 6 years. I go a few times a year. The bunks are adequate (you're camping, people!!!) and my gas heated cabin is always comfy. They offer a gas stove/oven and a refrigerator which is all convenient and family friendly if people aren't interested in "roughing it". I highly recommend going in the winter. The gas heated cabins are kept open and if you go midweek you can find yourself alone I'm the middle of a beautiful park. Be advised that most of Quaker Run is cellphone-free. That can be a blessing or a curse. You decide.
I haven't been down to Allegany in years - probably since college camping with friends from band.  I have good memories of cabin camping here! For Memorial Day weekend I headed down to Chautauqua Lake to visit some friends, and we thought we'd make a trip over to Allegany State Park for some hiking.  I'm in training to hike Mount Marcy later this summer, and I need to get more miles on mountains in.  For this reason we chose the Black Snake Mountain Trail at the southern edge of the park just beyond the Quaker Camping Area. It was a 3 mile trail (though I think maybe a bit longer) and had a steep ascent if you follow the trail up to the right.  It was a beautiful trail!  A bit muddy.  Lots of fallen trees to climb over.  It was really nice, though not as challenging as I had hoped.  The other positive was that there was no one on the trail with us.  For a holiday weekend, we were pleasantly surprised. After our hike we drove up to the Red House area.  I marveled at the beauty of the small lakes in the park.  They are so pristine!  And I love that there are so many people out enjoying nature. I am highly inclined to come back this season to hike some more, and maybe try a bit of camping with my husband.  He's not a fan, but I hear there are luxury cabins!?  He might be down for that!
Just like I do every year, I spent Columbus Day weekend camping in Allegany State Park with my family. Long ago we stayed on McIntosh Trail but six years ago we made the switch to Summit Trail right near the Art Roscoe Ski Summit/Fire tower on the Red House side of the park. These cabins have two rooms with two cots in each, are heated, and have a kitchen area complete with refrigerator, stove, counter space, and table. They're heated as well! Bathrooms are located in a separate building conveniently located in the middle of the trail. Back in the day I would go camping multiple times a summer with my dad and brother either in our old camper or tent. No matter what kind of shelter we had over our head, we had an awesome time. I've never had a bad time at Allegany State Park. Sure, our motto is "It's always an adventure with Dad" and Allegany helps that ring true. From the Bear Caves to Thunder Rocks to an old Tornado Site, there are literally countless things to see and do in Allegany State Park. Creeks, beaches, tennis courts, mini golf, oh my! Do you fancy fishing, kayaking, or canoeing? That is available as well. Personally, I love to go geocaching and Allegany is home to several night caches in addition to the annual GeoBash in April/May. Located about an hour and 45 minutes from Buffalo, Allegany is a great destination for all kinds of people ranging from nature enthusiasts and those looking to get away and relax in the tranquility of the great outdoors. Just don't feed the bears!
A truly fascinating park full of hiking, fishing, swimming, cabins, tent sites, and a creepy series of Native American folklore, ranging from animals standing on their hind legs to the infamous High Hat (dreamed up decades before Native Americans knew of stovetop hats). There's a different air about this place, something special and unique that isn't found in many other parks. My favorite spot was the thunder rocks, a series of massive boulders left behind when the last ice age receded. It's impressive to see and you can attempt to climb these large rocks. They go on for at least a quarter mile - that's as far as we walked - and it's truly an incredible site. I'd love to come back in the fall as the leaves all turn or to camp in the spring! I just, um, hope to not run into High Hat. ;)
Allegany is a huge state park spanning both Pennsylvania and New York State. It's an awesome place to go to camp, hike, swim, make fires, have a picnic and go fishing. I recently came here on Memorial Day Weekend for a camping trip. I felt super lucky to get a reservation for a cabin only a few days before the big weekend as they had a last minute cancellation. A cabin with 4 cots inside cost $79 (including fees) for two days and it was wonderful. It was along the Hamlin Trail (cabin #11) and even had a gas stove which we used to make breakfast. It was just one big open room with 4 cots inside it, the stove and a fireplace which is perhaps used in the winter time to heat the cabin (although the web site says this particular cabin is not winterized). We brought a sleeping bag + some pillows to lay on top of the cots with and it was pretty comfortable. We had a fire going most of the night to roast marshmallows right outside our camp site. You can buy wood at the general store which around a 10 minute walk from this particular camp site (or a 2m drive). You carry in your trash and they have a waste / recycle center that you can drop off in on your way out. The Allegany River is a good place to go fishing for trout and such. We did a little fishing here the first night we got in, but didn't end up catching anything..although our fishing neighbors did. Maybe our technique just wasn't so good :(. We only hiked one trail: The Bear Caves, which was about a 4mile hike. It had some elevation increases which was moderately challenging, but definitely had some nice views as you passed huge stones or "caves" alongside the trail. Allegany is a gem of a state park and Buffalonians are likely to live only an hours drive away. Great place for a getaway.
I had a really great time here. I really enjoy how on the website you can choose exactly the cabin you want instead of just luck of the draw. We stayed at Sugarbush in Red House. It was very peaceful during the day and kind of scary at night being that secluded. There was no one else there when we went bc it was during the week. We fished a little in the Red House Lake but really it seemed dead. In some areas where you could see the bottom there were methane bubbles coming up. But then there were ducks on it so there must be something in there. I know they stock it at least once a year. I wonder if they have to because the lake is oxygen deprived so wouldn't stock itself. We also went fishing on the Allegany Reservoir. That was a great time. There is a crappy movie theatre about 30min away in Olean and Kmart and Walmart. The bathrooms were very well kept and the showers too. The cabin was also very clean and neat. Never felt squeamish about bugs or anything. There were two sets of bunk beds. Therefore we had to share a twin size bed!! Probably could have thrown some mattresses on the floor together but we didn't. Saw a lot of deer. The heat works very well in the cabins. That's all I can think of right now. It's worth a visit!
Another awesome experience at Allegany this Memorial Weekend! Some additional tips: IMO I don't think its worth it to get a cabin in the Hamlin section for two reasons. You have access to an outhouse without showers. You have to deal with keeping a wood stove burning to get heat. I ended up walking over to the Diehl (sp) section where they had real bathrooms with showers and an area with deep sinks so you can wash your dishes. Next time I'm either going to tent it (~19 bucks for a spot), or stay in a cabin in the Diehl section of Quaker. My friends had their wedding here, it was a pretty sweet setup! The wedding was at the Quaker amphitheater, very cute. The reception was a tent at the picnic area across the way. The bathroom was a flushing toilet (no sink though) and it didn't smell. A quick walk down a path led to a bathroom with flushing toilets and working sinks. There was also a creek, and a playground if you wanted space from the wedding. Very, very cute wedding!

Amazing time climbing Bear Caves and Thunder Rocks. Sparkling lake, dense pretty woods. Only hitch was booked a very nice clean cabin that had too few beds to accommodate our family. That concrete floor was cold! Listing said "four beds, sleeps 6" and should have said "four twin bunks." Plan to return - with cots! Also had a fantastic delicious convenient dinner in the upstairs of the pretty and historic Red House Administration Building. There is little advertisement for the place but their menu is extensive, homemade and fresh at reasonable prices. Short drive there and back so you can get back to the campsite in time for S'mores.
Here are just some of the things that I have seen and done at Allegany State Park in my 36 years on earth: ...saw Thunder Rocks covered in snow and icicles as well as moss and ferns...grew one huge bicep scooping ice cream at the snack bar for three summers in a row...camped in cabins, tents and cars...wondered what that was walking around the tent...watched bears eating out of the dumpsters...saw beavers building dams...watched my Mom chase a raccoon up a tree after it stole a pork chop right off of the grill...walked around Red House Lake on a cold, dark winter night as well as on multiple hot summer days...saw colorful autumn leaves...shuffled through piles of fallen leaves so they made a shsh shsh noise...cross country skied at the summit...watched the sunset from the scenic overlook, the stone tower and over both Red House and Quaker lakes...watched bats swoop over Red House lake to scoop up the bugs...learned about wildlife and park history at the museum...looked for the first mention of robins every year in the bird sighting book at the Admin Building...built a campfire...identified migrating birds in the wetland area...pretended that the "lounge" area at the Admin Building was my living room...bought a sweat shirt and coffee at the gift shop because it gets darn chilly at night, even in the summer...hiked and biked hundreds of miles (no, not all at once, silly)...ate at the Red House Inn before they tore it down...ate at the Admin Building restaurant in its many incarnations (they give you free popcorn before dinner!)...played mini golf...paddled around Red House Lake in a row boat...found Bridal Falls...got stung by a bee...found a geocache...caught a fish...put two crayfish in a bucket and watched them fight...went skinny dipping (shhh)...went with friends to jump off the spillway one night, but chickened out at the last minute...went on a nighttime owl identification hike...found an owl pellet...got covered in mud in the bear caves...went to dendrology camp and got to "first base" for the first time...went spotlighting for deer...went sledding...ate wild blackberries...almost found Little Ireland...learned to orienteer...went on multiple field trips...made sand castles on the beach...took pictures...walked through stinging nettles...peed behind a tree...watched the Fisher's Big Wheel fireworks from the scenic overlook every 4th of July...listened to peepers...caught lightening bugs...sat alone by myself in the woods...saw every star in the sky...saw both lakes drained (and felt very sad)...walked across both lakes when they were frozen...felt minnows nibbling my toes...wondered if those mushrooms were poisonous...watched a newt eating a worm...got attacked by a Canadian goose...skipped rocks at Science Lake...saw a bat roosting under the covered bridge...looked for fossils...told ghost stories...listened to the stories told by my parents and grandparents of their experiences in the park and wished that I could have gone swimming in the Quaker pool or to a dance at the old Quaker store.
