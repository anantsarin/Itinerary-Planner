Kathy is great! I love this place cause they are great and very reasonable. A gel manicure is $26 and a French gel which I got was $30. Kathy is perfection when it comes to the white tips. I'm a perfectionist when it comes to my nails and she does a great job! The only negative part of my experience was  the owner told me my toes were dry. I put my socks on and went home. When I got home, my toes were smudged. Not too happy about that but my fingernails look fantastic!

First time visit and I left without the pedicure. I walked in and they told me it would be 15 minutes. I had some slight wiggle room for waiting, but not much more, so I stayed. As I sat down I noticed all their pedicures they were working on were pretty early in the process, so they basically lied to me. This was proven as 20  minutes later, I was still waiting. I got up to leave, but they then ushered me straight to a chair.  I then sat in the chair, my feet in warm water, for another 15 minutes, thinking that at any time they'd get to me.  At that point, they shouted to me, "two minutes!"  so I waited those two minutes, and then got up to leave.  They didn't even apologize. Look, if you're busy, just say so.  Give a reasonable estimate of how long it will be. That's better than outright lying. In all that time of waiting, I also noticed the salon was quite dirty.  There was clipped nails and skin all over the floor near my chair, which was gross.

I've had several bad experiences with this nail salon. I went to get my nails filled since it was the most convenient place at the time. I waited an hour to be seated! The lady cut me with a tool they use and looked at me like I did something wrong. I decided to get a design and showed the lady what I would like. She rushed and looked nothing like I wanted. After my nails were "finished" you could see my natural nail. I will not go back.

Tina is amazing. Ask for her by name. Her pedicures are the best I've had, bar none. I tend to be a bit ticklish and sensitive to even minor pain and I am pleased to say that she's the best out there. It's usually around $35/40 for an hourlong pedicure and it's worth every dollar. The only thing I'm not crazy about is the building's chemical overtones; they really need better ventilation.

bad all around. I went in 2 weeks ago for a manicure. The technician filed the tops of my already thin nails, i asked her to stop, but the DAMAGE was already done. she said she was trying to get the ridges out.  I had to cut my nails as short as possible and keep protective gel on them. So I figured she was just the wrong person for me. I went back today to get a pedicure, I am leaving tomorrow for vacation. A man was the tech. It was worse than if I had done it myself. He did a sloppy job, the nails were not evenly cut, polish was missing from the sides of some toenails, andm y cuticles were messy with polish- i just wasted $27, 45 minutes, and time at home to fix my manicure. I am done with Le Nails!

I came in to Le Nails recently for a pedicure, but I ended up leaving very disappointed. While I appreciate the fact that Le Nails has comfortable massage chairs for those getting a pedicure and such, I have to admit that the comfortable chair was one of the only real positives of my experience. Upon arriving, I briefly spoke to a woman on the staff, picked out my nail color, and sat down. A few minutes later, the woman came over and started the pedicure treatment. Sure, there's a leg massage with some scrub, but it's nothing above and beyond any other place that I've gotten a pedicure from. Add to that the fact that my toenails were cut and filed to be at least a bit crooked and my polish was done unevenly? Um...not so awesome. Basically, I'm giving this nail salon 2 stars instead of only 1 because of the comfortable chairs and the extra bit of attention my feet received with regards to my callouses (I wear high heels a lot at work, so I tend to have some callouses on the back of my feet, etc.). Otherwise? The experience was just sorely disappointing and I'll be going somewhere else for my next pedicure. I even came back home after my experience at Le Nails and removed all the polish and such that they had applied, filed my nails to look even, and THEN re-polished my nails. Honestly, my toes looked much cleaner when I did the entire process myself. In other words, don't waste your money.

Le Nails is in the corner of the shopping plaza that houses Pier One, Barnes and Noble, and Tops. I've only gone there a few times but have been happy with my services on each occaision.  I have to admit that I usually go to Miracle Nails on Route 13 next to the Hampton Inn, but last week, I needed a pedi and Miracle was too busy, so I went to Le. My pedicure was perfect. The operator took the time to razor off my (huge) heel callous, gave me a long and luxurious leg massage, and was careful to make sure that I was out in time. Maybe the best thing about Le Nails is the fabulous massage loungers. Each chair has an option for a buttocks massage. It might sound weird, but it's really great...you can sit there and have your butt and hips massaged while getting a pedi and no one will even know.  Very relaxing.

I found this place just driving by. They had clients at every station, so I assumed it was a good place for a set of nails. Boy, was I wrong! I'm a nail tech myself, and the list of things they would be shut down for is a mile long. (Using a razor on calluses is illegal in a salon in NY) But, as a client only, here's my issues: My nails look awful. They were all crooked, with acrylic on my skin, and big globs of acrylic stuck underneath that she didn't bother to fix. 4 days later, and they're all lifting off. Definitely not what I expected for a $50 set of nails. Grinding down the natural nail is NOT needed, and you're taught in nail school that it should not EVER be done. All that needs to happen is a light buffing to remove the top layer of oils. My nails look terrible, and it'll take at least 6 months to repair the damage they did to my nails, despite me asking the woman to not grind my nails, and asking that she remove the acrylic from my skin and from under the nail. It took me an hour to even make them presentable when I got home. I'll certainly not be recommending this place to anyone.

Worst nail salon experience I have ever had. The people are extremely rude. The service was horrible. Our nails look horrible. The man that works there is hostile and rude. We made an appointment and had to wait 30 min once we arrived. When we communicated that we were unhappy the forced us to pay and would no fix the problems. Trust me when I tell you to avoid this place at all coasts!

I took my 8 year old niece for a fun adventure the othe day that included manicures.  I really really wish those manicures had not been at Le Nails.  We walked in and 2 nail techs were sitting watching TV.  As soon as we asked for manicures they decided to do manicures on the 2 other women there that were getting pedicures so we then had to wait 20-30 minutes. At first my nails looked great, admittedly.  But the women were in a rush to leave and didn't let us fully dry so we both ended up getting smudges pretty quickly.  But then it got worse!  I don't know what that woman did to me but my nails have been cracking and peeling- something that has never happened to me before. And the polish selection is awful.  The only positive thing I can say is  that the woman did put a couple of flowers on my niece's nails, free of charge.  I wouldn't send my worst enemy here.
