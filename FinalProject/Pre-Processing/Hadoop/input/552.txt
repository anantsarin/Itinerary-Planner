Got my hair cut and dyed here. My stylist was Megan she was amazing. I wanted my hair to be a very crazy bright red, but not like I bleached my hair and put manic panic or something in my hair. I happened to have green tips in my hair when I decided I wanted to do this, but this didn't seem to be a problem for Megan she cut most of it out and did what I think they called a soak cap to lift my hair color before doing the red color. Now normally when places lighten my hair with bleach or anything of the sort my hair turns orange, but whatever they did lifted the color right out even the remaining green which they said might be hard. Anyways long story short my hair was fabulously red and trendy looking and the hair cut was awesome. I wish I didn't have to move so they could do my hair again.
