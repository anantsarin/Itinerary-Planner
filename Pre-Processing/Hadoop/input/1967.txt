We recently had to move out of our two bedroom apartment in literally two days due to a water pipe breakage. Beeline movers came to the rescue. We spoke to them over the phone and they were more than willing to move us on such short notice. Even though they had another job in the morning, they agreed to move us at night. They kept their word and actually showed up at night. The guys did not once complain of being tired or showed any signs of laziness. They were true professionals who handled all our furniture with great care (something I was very worried about since I have expensive furniture) and did a great job moving all our stuff into our new apartment. We are so happy we chose beeline movers in such a time of crisis and well we are not disappointed. Thanks guys for all your great work!!!
These guys are seriously amazing movers! We had been through a traumatic move with a big-name national franchise and decided to give Beeline a try for our next move. These movers hauled all of our stuff from a house & storage unit with smiles on their face for the entire day! Really great team and super professional!
Brendan and his team did a wonderful job packing up about 40 boxes of 16mm film prints.  They had to be handled carefully, properly, and also logged -- which they handled without a problem.  Brendan was efficient, easy to work with, and gave me a really great quote.  Highly recommend!
We were thrilled to have Brendan (owner) accommodate us so last minute!! We needed immediate delivery of a (very fragile) custom mantle and shelves, and they booked us without hesitation. They gave us a GREAT rate, and were excellent at keeping us updated on the time of delivery. They delivered everything in perfect condition! It is so nice to finally find a business that cares just as much about the delivery of your items as you do!! We will DEFINITELY be doing business with them again. Thanks BeeLine!!!
I moved a few months back and used Beeline Moving. They were very quick and very nice. All of my stuff made it to my new place in the same condition it left my old place. The moving guys were great, the owner was great. They were also the best price around. I would recommend them.
I can't begin to express my gratitude to this company and the men who moved me today from a 2256 sq ft house to a second floor apt. I had so much anxiety about this move especially getting my large bedroom furniture up a narrow staircase with a small landing at the top and my china cabinet to the attic. These guys couldn't have been more assuring and it was warranted! They achieved what I was sure was impossible and couldn't have been more careful doing it! I needed professionals and I got exactly that. In addition, my boyfriend needed a mattress moved and a couch disposed of. This was not part of the original plan but Brendan accommodated our last minute request. Thank you beeline! If I ever move from this apt. I'm going to need you again!
Owner (Brendan) was very nice and gave us a great rate. The movers were awesome and took great care of our furniture. No damage or scratches and the move was fast! Couldn't have asked for a better moving experience! Thanks guys!!
Hired beeline movers to move me from westchester county to dutchess county. They were professional, helpful, careful and precise with the entire move. I highly recommend them and would use them again in an instant.
I became aware of this company after researching online. Three months prior I had a  bad experience with a National moving company that I did not want to repeat. I decided to take a chance on this local, family style company as my previous approach failed me. Maybe a local mover that has to compete with big national brand names would try harder to please. Well I was correct. BeeLine movers were professional, courteous, respectful of me & my belongings & performed an outstanding job. From the time they walked in my door, I felt at ease. It was evident by how they wrapped every single piece of furniture that this move was going to be different. THEY CARED!! I had no damage whatsoever & the day was smooth sailing. The price was fair & I would highly recommend BeeLine to anyone. You will be in good hands.
We recently hired Beeline for a move in Orange County.  Quick estimate, good email communication, and the two guys who came to move the furniture were very professional.  Definitely will recommend to friends.
We've used these guys twice now. They could not be more accommodating, even working through Memorial Day weekend to accommodate our schedule, and delivering to multiple locations, all for a very reasonable price. I would not hesitate to use these guys. They're human.

These guys were awesome. Very careful with my stuff. We had some pretty heavy items and just a lot of loose stuff and boxes. Everything came out without a scratch. They communicated the whole time about what they were doing and where things should go. Very friendly and professional I also liked (loved) the fact that they were a flat fee. They weren't the cheapest, but they gave me a price and stuck to it, even though there was a misunderstanding of the amount of stuff I had (probably mostly my fault). Men of their word, which meant more than a low-ball price. No nickel and diming here. Moving is a stressful experience anyway. These guys helped make it less so.

They were super friendly, professional and most importantly they took great care of all of our stuff!

Brendan and his guys were great! My husband and I had an issue where the closing on our house fell through and was pushed back to a time where we had no one to help us.  We called on Thursday and set everything up for Monday.  They were reasonable priced and were able to come on Monday to empty out our townhouse and our storage unit and bring our stuff to our new home.  The guys were efficient and came with supplies and ready to work.  They stayed all day until the last boxes were moved, and were really pleasant and easy to work with.  They took great care of all f our stuff, and helped us with anything that was loose that we didn't think of.  We were very grateful to find such a professional company on such short notice, I would highly recommend this company to anyone in the area looking for a great moving company!

We moved in the rain and thunder storm and these guys were just great. They did a very professional job and I couldn't be happier with the work they did. I highly recommend Bee Line Movers for your next move.
