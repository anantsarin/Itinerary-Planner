We stopped by late in the afternoon. Greeted and seated promptly by very attentive and friendly waitstaff. Hot tea and crispy fried noodles served right away. Low mein, shrimp with cashews and chicken with almonds were delicious. Nice light sauce and tasty vegetables. We'll be back!!
Always good!  I like eat in better than take out though, you get crispy noodles and tea, with your meal.  Very pleasant wait staff and excellent service. Good prices and I love love love their hot and sour soup!
Great restaurant in Elmira. Service is the destruction around and food is always delicious!
Came in for dinner with a group of 8 before a show. What a great Chinese restaurant. The menu is diverse and the food was cooked well. If you are going to a show you should make this your pre show meal.
