I picked Clinical Dimensions blind in a google search for facials/spas after moving to Troy three years ago, and I've never looked back. Kathy is great at what she does. Because she used to be a medical lab tech, she understands the biological and chemical aspects of skin. She can talk about it in a way that makes sense. She's also just a wonderful person. I highly recommend her!
I love this place.  Kathy Tolcser is the sole facialist/spa tech, and she gives the best, most thorough facials in the area at a very reasonable price (and I should know as I've been to many of the local spas as a treat to myself after a grueling week of working and traveling.  (*In the interest of full disclosure, she was my girl scout troop leader when I was a little kid - but my face is not something I would trust to someone just because of a nostalgic bond.  She really does an excellent job).   The best thing about a facial at Clinical Dimensions is the mister and the chair - the mister is this wand that blows steam on your face and opens your pores, but more than that it just feels great when its cold outside.  The chair is this awesome Japanese thing that you recline in almost at 180 degrees - but when your mask is drying, she puts it on some setting where the leg part of it does figure 8's and its the most relaxing thing in the entire world.   If I could afford it, I would get a facial here every month - my skin glows after it, the Skinceuticals samples that Kathy gives me are great (and the face sunscreen for oily skin I bought upon her recommendation has been with me to Costa Rica, India, Brazil and Hawaii without letting my fair skin burn or breakout), and its just an awesome experience.  If you're springing for a facial and want to feel spoiled and pampered - Clinical Dimensions is where you want to go!
