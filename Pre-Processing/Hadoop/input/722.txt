Recently went to A Pure Day Spa and noticed that the management has changed. It has a new feel, new beginning, and a new staff. A lot of the stylists from Sorrata's (not sure if I am spelling it correctly) are there. They use to be located by Stewerts before they closed down. They offer a variety of services and are always able to schedule at a time that is easy for you. They do great manicure's and pedicure's. They also have a day spa package that doesn't cost nearly as much as the one from Kimberly's but has the same exact procedures included. I definately recommend going there.
I made an appointment for a petite facial and an hour long massage. Chong Ho was fantastic. She began the appointment by discussing what I wanted her to focus on and explaining to me how she was going to proceed with the services. The massage was wonderful. Chong Ho worked out the kinks in my neck and shoulders and left me feeling relaxed. She then went right into the facial, smoothly letting me know in quiet tones what she was doing. Both services were top notch. The only drawback to my visit was the lack of a locker and relaxation room. It would be wonderful to be able to change into a robe and slippers beforehand and finish out the appointment in a quiet, darkened relaxation room with a glass of water before getting changed and leaving.
