This is NOT in the Bronx; it's in Austerlitz! We were driving down Route 22 yesterday and found this fascinating place.  The sculptures are the work of a very friendly man with a great sense of humor - Bijan - and his large paintings are also exhibited, in a small building on the property.  We really enjoyed wandering around the grounds and later talking to Bijan.
Not as good add storm king, but maybe better than dia beacon? (kidding). Small one person sculpture park, pretty cool. A lovely little unexpected art adventure in any case. From the Albany post: "The Circle Museum is a registered Columbia County Museum consisting of over 100 large-scale works of sculpture. In this location for 25 years, BIjan Mahmoodi is the owner of the museum and the artist. His art reflects his fascination with hard-to-find Industrial Era fabricated metals and bronze casting. Inside the artist's studio, also on the property, is a collection of Bijan's oil paintings that explore the circle motif you see in most of his sculptures. Why is it called the Circle Museum? Bijan explains.... "Because our planet is based on the circle - the sun, the planets, the moon and life itself is cyclical.The circle is what inspires me."
We were driving down Rt. 22 (the middle of nowhere), and we saw this on the side of the road and had to stop!  It was a nice distraction.  The guy does interesting work.
Fun place to explore. Met the artist and he was great.
