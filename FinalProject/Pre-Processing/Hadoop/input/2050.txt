Okay. So I'm visiting my sister and she's not up for an outing. But I just drove 400 plus miles the day before, and I need a kummelweck fix something bad, man. Can I sit in a dark establishment alone, swilling a cold draft, then inhale the legendary beef on weck I desperately desire? No. So, I order a Yuengling draft and order BOW's to go, cuz I'm her best brother.  Yeah. I'm the best brother. Before I'm able to tap out a draft review, before my draft beer was finished, the large bag appears. $8.99 for a BOW. Life is good. The sandwich was generous, the beef tender, the roll loaded with salt just as it should. Maybe the horseradish was not eye watering fresh. Oh, well. I'm still the best brother.
what's not to like? great food-the beef on weck, reuben, pizza, wings are top notch. They have micro brew beers on tap in a friendly, casual setting. Great prices too!
Always a great spot to stop in after my long shifts.  Staff is extremely friendly and attentive. One of the best places for a variety of beers and great selection of food!
Although I have passed this place a few times, I have never actually been inside the place until this past Friday night. Upon walking in, the place is a nice looking establishment, very clean and the people inside are seemingly professional and friendly when approached. I had strictly gone in for a drink and ordered their house IPA, which was good but definitely lacked the hoppiness I was looking for. Seemed sort of flat and almost finished like a Brown Ale (New Castle's aftertaste came to mind). Another friend ordered the house Amber and said it was a good brew to order. As for food, it was your standard bar/grill food we ordered (nachos, steak sandwich, mozzarella sticks) all of which were pretty good, but the steak sandwich seemed to be the best of the 3 we had. My only reason for demoting this place to 3 stars is the service from the bar staff. When we walked in they had 3 people working the bar (I assume they were expecting a larger crowd?) but that didn't help any. Our original bartender was very courteous, recommended some beers to friends, and got our orders quickly. However; once she left it was downhill. It took my friends 15 minutes or so after getting their menus for one of us to get the attention of the seemingly oblivious male bartender who took solace in talking with other patrons at the back of the bar. The other girl working was absolutely oblivious to everyone at our side of the bar, instead she would sit in front of the computer/register monitor for chunks of time then clean some glasses and go back to the computer. I'm definitely on the fence about going back.
This place didn't really overwhelm me- food or decor; think TGIFriday's and this is pretty much a wannabe. Coming here for a company dinner, we were a party of about sixteen.  We made reservations, and were seated in a back room with other parties.   One star for the wait staff - they were on point, patient, helpful, and friendly One star for convenience - the location One star for the bbq wings - they were wayy better than the buffalo, which was a bit disappointing Pretty typical in my book.
The best thing about the Buffalo Tap Room is that you can see a TV from almost any seat.  This makes it a great place to watch Sabres games, which I did on Saturday night while having dinner.  Decor in the dining room is pretty basic, though, and I had a plastic plant poking me in the back of my head through all of my latest meal here. As far as the food is concerned - I've never been overly impressed.  The wings are pretty good - nice and big and spicy - but this is Buffalo, so I'm not going to get overly excited about that.  This past visit I got the loaded fries or whatever.  I was expecting something a bit more . . . refined?  Maybe that's not the right word.  I was expecting like real cheese baked on or something.  What I got was a plate of tiny little french fries covered in nacho cheese (or similar molten cheese) and tiny pieces of crumbled bacon - which at first I thought were bacon bits, but blessedly they weren't.  Just underwhelming. They do have a decent beer selection, mostly microbreweries, which is always a plus.  Also, everyone else I know always raves about their food, so maybe I'm just being picky...
Meh. We went last night for fish fry.  There was nothing spectacular about the fish fry. It was a standard fish fry that was reasonably priced.   Con: 35-45 minute wait for a table at 7:30 at night. Too long.
I went to this place for the first time to watch the Bills game on Sunday, when CBS decided to torture us by holding out on us viewers and cable service providers by blocking out the channel (shame on them for making us, Bills fans, run to the nearest sports bars or to our friends' house with dish network) Anyhow, the place serve a lot of microbrews for decent price [per pint/pitcher] (which is always a plus in any man's heart) and their finger food is excellent!!  I've had brooklyn lager and their grilled cajun wings; both were brilliant!! A+ They have a full bar w/ number of flat screen LCDs on the walls for sports games. I've never been to the restaurant next-door but i hear great things about their Entre dish.
I am giving this place five stars based on the fact that it is a sports bar. They have great food and a great beer selection. The hot banana pepper dip is great and not spicy at all! I can't wait to go back and try the stuffed banana peppers themselves. I had a terrific roasted mushroom salad and my dinning partners burger was great! Service was wonderful and very helpful and attentive! This is a great place to grab something to eat and watch a game! Great food, great service and a great price! For an area so full of chains this is a nice addition and I can't wait to go back and try some more of their menu!
Stopped in for lunch today, used to go here often, first time back since I moved to Vegas six years ago. Used to like it a lot due to beer selection, since back then not every bar carried good micro brew like nowadays. Just sat at the bar which only had one other person at it. Had the steak french dip sandwich, which was delicious. Nice slices of strip steak on a slightly toasted bun with caramelized onions and melted provolone, and on the side some au jus for dipping. Decided to get some soup for my choice of side, which was garden tomato. Soup was good with veggies in it seeming nice and fresh. Okra was a nice touch in it. Would have got the pasta fagioli because it was one of my wife's favorites but it would have cost $2 more. It is very good from what I remember though.
Food is wonderful!  Delicious buffalo chicken wing dip!  One drawback of the place is that they do not serve any fish or seafood on days other than Friday. Otherwise, a great place!
Amazing wings!  Servings were over large!  Meat lovers pizza was delicious!  Huge beer selection!       Could use a decor update as it was dark because of the paneling!     Family restaurant separate from bar area!       Service was unbelievable!  Asked for recommendations and she was right on!
Hadn't been here in a couple years so thought we'd stop in...it appeared crowded from parking lot but turned out it was from the gym next door.  There were only 5 tables eating when we arrived around 6.  We were seated immediately, and drink orders taken.  Then unfortunately we waited quite a while for our waitress to take our order.  Finally she arrived and took our order...I had portabello sandwich and side salad, boyfriend had grilled chix sandwich and fries.  My salad was a disappointment - anemic lettuce and a couple slices of onion and about 4 sliced black olives.  My pet peeve is salad plates that are too small for the salad..., one fork into the salad and about half the lettuce and 3 of the 4 olives fell off the plate!  lol  The sandwich was quite good...thankfully I ordered some garlic mayo...(which I had to ask for otherwise it would have been dry...thought maybe she could have mentioned the options)  Boyfriend also had a 'dry' grilled chix sandwich and borrowed some of my mayo.   Then we were done and sat...and we sat...only one other table arrived while we had been there..so again, it wasn't busy...everyone seemed to be back in the kitchen.  She did finally come through and we waved her over, asking for our check...she  brought the check- started walking away and I said.."no wait...stay here" (lol-didn't want the disappearing act again)  And we paid our bill and left. I wouldn't say it will be on my list of 'regulars' but it was 'ok' and would try again in a pinch.
I've been to the Tap Room a few times before and I've always enjoyed it. Good service and food. We decided to go the other day, my first time in a couple years and I enjoyed it even more. We tried a few of their house beers, which were delicious (the ones I tried). I got the Strawberry Blonde and Summerfest. My boyfriend had the Rye IPA and one other. Strawberry Blonde was my favorite, nice and refreshing. The food was good. I got the chicken pesto sandwich which was kind of messy but really good. And they added roasted red peppers to it for me! I had it with a side salad, which was 99 cents extra but they have two house dressing to choose from. I had the basil vinaigrette and it was alright but kind of lacked in flavor. I also highly recommend the appetizer we got, the Stuffed Banana Pepper dip. Delicious! The waitress talked me into joining the rewards club (which was pretty easy for her to do), where you collect points every time you go and once you reach 200 you get $10. On your birthday you also get a $15 gift card and Mondays and Tuesdays you can double your points. $1 = 1 point. Overall, nice and relaxing place to enjoy a beer or a meal (or both).
Great beer selection with a variety of their own microbrews. I've never had a complaint with the food or the service. Truly one of buffalo's best!
We went here last night and I was less than impressed to say the least. I had been here before in the bar area, which was enjoyable, but it looks like they are depending on the bar to keep them alive. I understand that this is a tap room, but when I asked about specialty martinis, the waitress told me that they have nothing of the sort. Awesome. For a place that seems to be getting by with the bar crowd, there should be something to appeal to those looking for something other than beer. My family and I started off with the supreme nachos. The plate was huge but the toppings were scarce. And who in their right mind charges an extra $1 for salsa....on nachos...  The cheese tasted like it came from the dollar store, which is ok for home, but for a $10 appetizer, not as desirable. Next came the soup and salad. I decided to go with the seafood chowder. Big mistake. You think chowder, you think thick creamy deliciousness right? Wrong. It came out looking like a watered down version of Campbell's cream of mushroom. The worst part? Salad shrimp from a can.  My families salads were small and meager at best. Dressing came in condiment cup with the top on so you know it had been sitting around. Then there was the entree. Friday during lent in buffalo. Ordered the captains platter which is fried fish, shrimp and scallops. I think I may have seen the empty frozen seafood box from Aldi in the garbage on the way out. I really could have paid a lot less and had the same thing at home. My daughter had the chicken parm, which looked decent but the sauce was a very dark red, which just reminded me of blood and was a total turnoff. They seemed busy but no as busy as you would expect for a Friday night at 6pm. The chairs are ridiculously hard with no cushion and the tables are tightly packed together.  Another faux pas...walking through a cloud of smoke to get to the front door from the bar patrons smoking outside. Yuck. If that wasn't bad enough, all you can see out the front window as you "try" to enjoy your meal is the crowd of smokers in front of the door. Poor planning. Overall, this establishment will continue to do business because of the craft beer on tap which the husband said was decent. We, however, will not be back.
We have eaten here countless times for lunch (a favorite for my father and brother) and everything has been good...burgers, sandwiches, salads, even their pizza is pretty good.
As far as small, independent bar and grills go in the Tonawanda/Amherst area there is none better in my mind. Somewhat tucked back in a plaza on Eggert near Sheridan Drive, it has one of the cleanest looking bars and some of the best choices for pub food and drink in the area. What usually brings me to the Tap Room is the beer selection. They have at least 8 beers of their own on tap and usually 21 in total. There's something for everyone in their micro-brews ranging from the dangerously sweet Strawberry Blonde to the robust Brown Ale and a range of seasonal selections. If you can make sure to make it over there for their Holiday Ale, which tastes like a combination of gingerbread cookies and heaven itself. They always seem to fly through those kegs so make sure you get there before you begin any of your holiday shopping. The food selection is also some of the most underrated in the region. When people talk of Buffalo pizza they often go with Bocce, La Nova, or any of the other larger names. But for pizza that comes quick and is always delicious I don't think you can do much better than the TR. The same goes for the wings as I'd put them right up there with Duff's and the kings of Buffalo. Try the Jamaican Jerk or Cajun wings--unbeatable. The one drawback may be the price. While the food is probably the best pub food in the area, you'll likely pay more than you're used to. While a few dollars more for a sandwich, pizza, or wings won't matter if you're slamming 4 pints of craft beer, you will notice that things tend to just be priced higher. But in the end, you pay for quality and its quality you certainly get. Favorites: Cajun and Jamaican Jerk wings with a Holiday Ale to wash it all down. Not-so-favorites: Paying the highest prices for that food in the local area. But a minor drawback. Definitely a must-go!
This tap room and grill is in an unexpected location: in fact, if my friends didn't tell me this exists, I would not have known about it. Anyway, together with a large group of friends, we went there one Friday evening for dinner and drinks. There are two sections of the place: the dining room, and the bar. We opted for the bar, but in both locations, one can still get the same food. They have a larger-than-usual selection of beers, very appropriate for a tap room. I had the hefeweizen, and I also ordered some wings. I couldn't complain about the beer, nor about the food, per se, but there seems to be something lacking in the overall setup that I cannot say I thoroughly enjoyed the place. It might be a tap room, but I felt like there wasn't enough "interesting" beer selections. And the food might have been tasty, but it really felt like it took ages for it to come out. I should say, however, that the staff was friendly, but the timing and selection can use some improvement in my opinion. So, will I head over here again? Maybe, I haven't written them off. I'll probably be here when I am with a large group of friends, so that conversation can fill the void of the what-seemed-to-me a longer-than-usual wait just to get one's food.
