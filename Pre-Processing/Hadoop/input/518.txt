Out of the syracuse area YMCAs , this is the one with he great aquatic pool area! It's hot out there, Learn how to swim! Free child care while you work out.
I've been a member of the Fayetteville YMCA for about 2 years and have been visiting about 3 times per week since joining. I love the facility because it is spacious, clean, and well-lit. The atmosphere is very welcoming and non judgmental; I always feel comfortable working up a sweat. I usually use cardio machines, namely the elliptical, and always find one (or several) to choose from. I have also taken Zumba and Yoga classes, which are included with the membership fee. The instructors were knowledgeable, friendly and encouraging. I plan to maintain my membership to the Y for as long as I can afford it, I truly enjoy it!
The East Area YMCA is an almost new facility. It has brand new work-out equipment, two pools, three basketball courts, and three massive areas full of treadmills, elliptical machines, bikes, free weights, and assisted weights. The staff is very nice and willing to help and you really cant ask for more. This YMCA is also very friendly to families who have kids ranging from 0 on up. All-in-All it is one of the best places to get fit as a person and a family.
I go to the East Area YMCA for their yoga classes. My family gets a family membership. My other family members go to work out, swim, and zumba classes. I often wish that the yoga classes were a little more varied (like in the yoga studio-scene). Overall, we're very happy with our membership.
This is a Beautiful gym, especially for families. Large swimming area, plus kiddie/family pools, and a variety of activities. From a traditional gym stand point, they have no shortage of cardio equipment, including variety. No individual televisions, however. Additionally, they do not have eSpinning bikes like the Clay Y does. The biggest downfall is that they do not have wireless available either, besides in the lobby.
