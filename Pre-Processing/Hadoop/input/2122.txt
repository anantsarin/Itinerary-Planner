Great service from Danielle. Nice lunch, I had the turkey club served with chicken wing soup. The soup was great, just the right amount of heat. Well made sandwich with fresh bread served quickly. Great for lunch if you are in the area.
Great beer selections for after work hours!! Great lunch including speed lunch guaranteed to be 15 minutes or less! Try the buffalo chicken quesadilla.
This place was an oasis in an otherwise desert of a drive from Cleveland to Buffalo. The server came quick and the food even quicker. She (Jenn) was pleasant. The food was great, the kickin bourbon was in the top five sauces I've ever had, and the beef on weck came with horseradish, au jus, and a garlic buttered roll. I would shoot someone for that roll.
Worst food on fairmount ave. way to big of a menu and since the casino in bemus has the same owner it don't surprise me that the food is sub par at best. The two places need to separate because right now they both suck.

Had the chicken parm. It was pretty good. Was a massive portion. However, the southern tier craft beer phone and matts at $5.50/16oz draft is overpriced. Considering the brewery is two miles away (I know they still have to buy it from a distributor) they can kiss my ace at that price. $4 maybe $4.50 but don't balance your budget on my beer price. You know what? Next time I'll just order a water. Believe me, I'm fine with that.

I like this place, but a couple of things bug me.  The wings were tasty (I recommend the Signature Sauce), but small.  I was also a little disappointed I couldn't substitute boneless in a wings and fries entree.  Why not?  There were a lot of TV's, consistent with the classic sports bar feel, but they're very small.   Whatever, I'm being picky.  The side dishes are good, the service was good, and it wasn't too loud, even for a sports bar.  I'd go again if I find myself in the area.

I have been here a total of four times since they opened. I have not had a meal that I would describe as good, however several people I know have. The steak is a complete waste of money. Their burger was a greasy mess. I have heard their wings are good but honestly I wouldn't spend the money. For the same money I can take my family to a much better meal. All in all, unless I draw the short stick i do not see myself eating here again. Sad since I love to support local business.

My girlfriend and I tried out wing city grille and were very disappointed. She ordered the buffalo fish sandwich and when it came out the bread was dry and hard, the fish was edible but nothing to write home about.  I had the cuban panini with the homemade buffalo chips.  The panini was pretty good but I was shocked at the lack of any seasoning on the chips.  Service was pretty good.

I was there on a Friday night, alone in a new town, and sat in the bar area. The waiter showed up in less than three minutes, but apologized for making me wait. It was very busy, but he was great. I couldn't decide between the wings or a burger, and he very helpfully suggested an Angus burger. It was juicy, cooked perfectly, and the fries were those double crisp ones that taste like they are coated so they're very crunchy. The only downside was two drunk couples next to me who were very loud. But it IS a bar! Maybe not a place to take grandma.

Wings were satisfactory but a bit small. Service was friendly. Has a very sterile, typical sports bar aesthetic. Won't rush back; however, I wouldn't not go again.

I love this place! Wings are pretty good but even better is the Beef on Weck. I'm not a huge fan of the sandwich in general, but they do it REALLY well there. The horseradish, au jus and salt on the roll totally rock together. The service has ranged all over the place, but it's more often good than poor.

Absolutely delicious.  Tasty wings, good cocktails, great sandwiches.

I visited here a few times, and the food was good. I loved the desert menu, the chocolate lasagna was unreal
