I wanted to avoid 1) driving and 2) my hotel restaurant so my boyfriend and I ended up at this place. I thought this was more of a sitdown place but its more like Panera Bread. Order your food then pick it up and sit down. Line was long but it moved fast.  You have a choice of a single or twin waffle. Obviously a twin waffle is more money. Overall, waffles were good and fried chicken was amazing.Waffles were good but presentation was sad? They were on paper plates. Ordered a side of eggs, also as my boyfriend pointed out, "it's sad looking"  My single fried chicken and waffles, side of eggs, plus my boyfriend's eggs and bacon on a single waffle plus an iced americano came to $22 which wasn't bad at all.
Waffle was tasty but not worth the 30 minute wait at the counter. I wouldn't bother to go back.
The service isn't great. My waffle looked nice and tasted nice. I went with my roommates and they thought the waffles were sweet. I agreed, because they are...waffles. Waffles are sweet. Anyway, I got a twin waffle with Nutella and a fried banana. The fried banana was my favourite part. They gave me and my roommates our waffles at different times which was stupid because I got mine before any of them and it got cold.
I come here nearly every weekend I'm in Ithaca and order a relatively basic waffle and coffee. Both are surprisingly delicious treats; I was surprised by how consistently good the coffee is, in fact. At first, service was a bit scattershot, but the management seem to have gotten a hang of things and it's improved immensely over the last year. Word is, Waffle Frolic has actually been so successful that they're expanding into the space next door. That's especially good news because I've never been a fan of the joint's layout: most of the seating is upstairs, requiring a shuffle down to grab your order (or a long wait before even going after a table) and then a careful walk up with what might be multiple cups and/or plates. I think the upper floor, where most of patrons eat their food, has also suffered from some neglect - something about the seating upstairs looked both a bit cheap and/or tired even from day one and could use some more sprucing up, though I see that the stools next to the second-story windows have been improved, which shows they're attending to the issue. This space also looks like it could stand to be more frequently cleaned, too, or at least freshened up paintwise. And while I like the idea of the library hidden in a back corner, but it almost seems like someone's forgotten, just-exposed closet: it should be expanded and highlighted more.
I love this place. I stop by every time I'm in area. Sweet, savory, the grilled cheese they are all delicious. I was happy to see this past weekend when i stopped in that they got a speaker system which allowed for customers to place their orders and then grab seats which made the first floor not as crowded and easier for flow throughout the whole place.

Shared a twin waffle with bacon and eggs and an americano. The waffle itself was okay - nice and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, but it was bland. The bacon and eggs were delicious and cooked perfectly. The coffee was good but a little on the sweet side. Service was so slow. The person working at the register seriously acted like they were on muscle relaxers. I had to repeat my order three times while she stared vacantly into space and slooooowly found the right buttons to press. So that was pretty weird. The food was expensive for brunch, but a lot of their ingredients are local and/or organic. Why can't anyone here manage to wipe down a table? Every single one upstairs was sticky. Still, a fun place to check out if you're not in a hurry and you don't put your elbows on the table.

On any other day I would tell you that this is the best place on earth. .... But we get there today and they are closed.  I have no words to tell you how sad I am.  We only get to this area once a year and this is a MUST go to. I am Soooo sad and pissed.

Excellent fried chicken.

Chicken and Waffles....enough said.....Their waffles with the fried chicken drizzled with hot sauce and their syrup is my favorite breakfast item in the world. I seriously go to no other place for breakfast anymore. The cornbread waffle and turkey chili is also one of my favorites. This thing is awesome and loaded with chili which is amazing as well! I've actually yet to try any other waffles as when I go I always go in with the intent to try something new but that chicken and waffles just can't be beat and alas, I always order that!

We were visiting from out if town and wanted to find something gluten free.  We had the gluten free waffle/egg/bacon and the vegetable burger.  Wow!  Amazing tasting food and incredible service.  Tip, the twin waffles are huge!  Glad we stopped here.
Excellent fried chicken.
I love breakfast! I was excited to try Waffle Frolic and wasn't disappointed. Props for having buckwheat waffles. We got one with banana, peanut butter and honey (the Elvis) and the other one with banana, strawberries and nutella. The waffles were good, slightly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. They also have savory waffles, which I would have liked to try. The prices were okay, about $6 for a twin sized waffle and additional charges fort the toppings. You order at the counter and they'll call you pick up your order. I noticed that people tended to stay to study there.. so with limited seating, it can get crowded.

Lots of varieties of waffles will greet you to this restaurant in the Ithaca Commons.  It's a restaurant that seemed to be very popular with college students, at least during the time I went to (which would be noon, an early brunch hour).  You get a lot of choices when it comes to waffles.  You can have your traditional breakfast waffles, chicken and waffles or even dessert waffles.  Also, if you're not in the mood for waffles, you can order other food there as well. In my case, I was tempted to order the chicken and waffles, but I decided to have something more sweet than savory.  Ultimately, I decided to order the classic buttermilk waffles with my choice of toppings, which you do pay extra for.  So my waffles were topped with ice cream and chocolate chips, which made for a good dessert type waffle.  I also washed down my meal with an Italian soda.  The food was filling and delicious.  A little bit different food before an afternoon hike, but I enjoyed my meal nonetheless, and would certainly consider coming back here in the future.

Bad service, bad set up, bad management. This place is run by a bunch of Inexperienced People. It's not a restaurant, that is for sure. What started it all for me is that I ordered Chai tea from here, a particular size which I was charged for then i was told after my order was ready, these are the mugs we have. After I complained nothing got resolved, no refund or serving of purchased size. The place was messy as hell, after I asked someone to come clean an empty table (which is someone's job) the chick had a pissy attitude. The layout is a mess, there are no assigned or given tables/spaces to eat... So you order first then find a spot... After searching and waiting (there were no places to sit and eat) but over time we lucked up and got a spot (again dirty, see above). I did Read the reviews on yelp and sought after this place. This has to be one of the worst places I've eaten. It's pretty obvious a lot of the reviews are from staff or friends of friends because the experience is lame. Needs new management, new experienced staff and Organization. As we left we did notice a place directly across from this "College mess hall" I don't remember the name but we went in and it was a complete 180 of the other Establishment/ College mess hall that we left. if you are an out of towner, Check that place out.

My boyfriend came to visit for the weekend so we decided to get waffles for brunch. The waffles were decent, but overall, it was just very very sweet. He had the banana split and I had the bacon and eggs. His waffle was very sweet, and while my bacon and eggs were really great, it was just a plain old waffle after I finished that. Not sure what was up with service, but we ordered a Chai Tea Latte and a Pumpkin Spice Latte. They don't call out your orders when they're done so there were just a bunch of mugs sitting on the counter. When I asked what drink was what, the lady making the drinks forgot to keep track of them. And so they just pointed to a mug and said that it might be a chai. If I had an allergy to something else and I actually tried the drink and it wasn't chai, that could have been a serious issue. I'm not sure why they even did that. And they forgot to make the pumpkin spice latte so they made that afterwards. What?? They should seriously label their drinks AND call out the drinks when they're ready because this place is a order at counter pick up yourself place. How are we supposed to know if we should pick it up if you don't announce it? I want to say 1.5 stars, but I'll give it 2 stars for the decent waffles. They were soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. Definitely not filling though because you're literally just eating sweets so I needed some real food afterwards.

Chili and cornbread waffles, duh! Friend Chicken and waffles, of course! This place was pretty good. I'm not going to say it blew my mind, but it was solid and had some great choices. I would definitely recommend it for lunch or a snack. I wish the waffles were more impressive, but they just seemed OK. But you can't go wrong with waffles and something salty!

I went there on a Sunday afternoon with my husband, having wanted to try it for a long time. We had a fine time but both left feeling like it wasn't as great as we had been told: -It's nice that there's a place open late in Ithaca that's not a bar, however I was left wondering if the late hours were the reason that everyone who worked there appeared hungover or tired. They were very slow, considering the line out the door and I had to keep repeating what I ordered to the cashier. Everyone looked half asleep. -The aforementioned maple syrup issue (from another poster) is very real: my husband, a maple syrup purist, ordered syrup and got a tiny pot of diluted maple syrup. Considering this year was a terrible one for maple syrup and these guys are just starting out, that might be understandable (there was a little old lady at the table next to me that brought her own). Hopefully they will be able to offer better maple syrup in the future. -The thing that really bothered me was that I requested fresh fruit on my waffle and was told that nothing was in season at the moment and it was really important to them that they source their fruit locally, so I could either have preserved blueberries or bananas. That's right, the alternative to fruit not being in season locally is to buy bananas, which are never in season anywhere north of Mexico. I got the blueberries because I hate bananas and then wondered what was wrong with strawberries that I happen to know are in season much, much closer than Mexico. -The waffles themselves were nice, the atmosphere outside, where we ate, was pleasant. Overall, I'd probably go back but I'm not running. It's INFINITELY better than "That Awful Burrito Place" that was there before. It's a nice idea and I'd like to encourage places like this to stay open, but the waffles weren't that exciting and they've gotten to straighten some kinks out.

I'll admit I'm not a waffle expert by any means, Waffle Frolick appears to be a welcome addition to the Commons for breakfast food considering the limited options for a quick cafe style breakfast. However, I've never heard of an enthusiastic following for waffles and having experienced a restaurant that's supposed to specialize in waffles, I'm still not convinced. This self proclaimed 'waffle bar/coffee house' just opened last Saturday on 4/17 with what seemed to be a lot of interest, but I dropped by on a weekday when there was hardly anyone around. Staff working was friendly and recommended that I try their Hemp Buckwheat waffles instead of the usual buttermilk type, sure why not? I still don't understand the obsession with hemp shops that's so prevalent in Ithaca. Waffle orders come in single or double sizes, the single size being more than enough to make a person full. The recommended toppings were the day's compotes, which was pretty much a raspberry mix, along with whipped cream which I opted instead for just maple syrup. The waffle texture was a bit tougher than what you'd normally expect from a buttermilk one, slightly crunchy and the toppings added were standard, didn't really add much to the waffle experience. Negative: Pricing. Base waffle price is $2.50ish for a single waffle, around $7 for a double. Toppings range from 25cents each to $1 whereas unlimited toppings will cost you an additional $2.50. Not sure how my total for a single waffle with syrup & compotes came out to be $6.21. For one waffle at a take out style location, not to be cheap but it sounds impractical. Think the best part about the place was the interior and upstairs area, its inviting and cozy with couches since the intention was to make it a place to kick back and lounge with friends, there's even a bookshelf loaded with books you can exchange. Apparently the artwork featured on the walls can change, and the subtle wall art mixed in with waffle images is aesthetically pleasing. Worth a try.
Wow, there are really few places like this in Ithaca, it was great. Lots of vegan options and really tasted unique. Taste was great, I had a buckwheat waffle (amazing texture by the way) with blueberries, powdered sugar, and syrup. My friends went with a ice cream banana split with blueberries and another with a nutella blegian waffle with syrup. There are so many options, they all taste great. The single waffle is pretty big so you should be satisfied with that The staff are great and nice. They were really willing to help me out because it was my first time ordering here. Also the lounge upstairs was so quaint and a unique idea. It's a nice place to just chill with a friend, grab coffee and dessert, and talk. For a dessert place in Ithaca, not many places like here, although a little on the pricey side. Definitely check it out.

Amazing.  I was in Ithaca for only four days, but this place was definitely a must on the list.  I love waffles.  I especially love chicken and waffles (especially because of Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles in LA) but the menu was terrific at Waffle Frolic! I didn't end up ordering the chicken and waffles, and went with the chili waffle instead. Massive and delicious; hence, massively delicious. The cornbread waffle? Superb.  I was worried that it'd be too much cornbread and not enough waffle, but it was the perfect balance of both. And the chili was good too. My friend did order the chicken and waffles and I must say, I absolutely love the HOT SAUCE.  I think it was a maple syrup hot sauce type of deal?  It tasted sort of like a cross between Frank's Red Hot sauce and maple syrup, but more natural and fresher I suppose?  Whatever it really is, I thoroughly enjoyed it. If I ever find myself in Ithaca again, I'l definitely be coming back to Waffle Frolic for coffee and waffles.

One of my favorite spots in Ithaca.  My favorite savory waffle is the fried chicken (which is gluten free) on a hemp waffle with the AMAZING maple hot sauce. For sweet, you can't beat a scoop of Purity ice cream (a good combo is green tea ice cream with lemon curd--sounds weird but its good!) and whipped cream. Going overboard here is really easy because everything is SO good. Good ambiance, really casual and everyone's friendly and helpful. The setup inside is really cool-- it's set up like a loft with the waffle bar downstairs and the seating upstairs. They also have a book exchange which is lovely.  A really original place with good food and a nice atmosphere.

Is chicken and waffles an East Coast (Beast Coast) thing? Waffle Frolic was the first place I've tried this tasty combo. The Grub -- * Ice Cream Sandwich ($9) - Twin waffle folded over with two scoops, whipped cream, chocolate and caramel sauce Venue Review -- Waffle Frolic is a hipster's dream (or at least I think it would be). The place is built like an artist's loft with a whole bunch of colors, chalk that lets you draw all over the place, and a second story connected by an iron staircase. It has a fun vibe! Food Review -- Over the few times I've been here I've tried their soups, sandwiches, and most recently, the Ice Cream Sandwich. The food has a Panera Bread sort of feel to it, always toasty and rich. There are many Vegan options out there as well. The Ice Cream sandwich was sweeeeeet. I almost felt guilty eating it because it was loaded with chocolate, caramel, whipped cream and two heaping scoops of ice cream. If you're not in the mood for dessert food, try the chicken options (you can choose to have a single or twin waffle bed). Service Review -- Order your food, pick it up at the counter, and grab yourself a seat! It'd be nice if they brought the food over to you, it really hasn't been that busy the times that I've been there. Overall Impression -- Waffle Frolic's sweet and salty blends of chicken and waffles was a new experience for me a couple years ago and I love the combo. The vegan-friendly and gluten free menu is perfect for anyone with allergies or "picky" eaters. They have labels on all the options and the decor makes you feel right at home.

The fried chicken and waffles was my choice based on another review.  Great choice, I might add.  It came with a hot sauce maple syrup.  Trust me, it's better than it sounds.  The sauce wasn't hot really, more of the flavor of hot sauce.  It was something similar to the taste of Texas Pete's.  You get 3 pieces of fried chicken on top of the waffle (see my photo).  I had a mug of hot Nutella which was decent.  It wasn't as hot as I'd like it but it's fine. The waffles come in half or whole.  Honestly, a half is enough for one person.  A full is bigger than a plate. Their layout is a little odd.  The line for ordering begins pretty much near the entrance so it forces ppl in line to have to move whenever someone comes in the door.  The pickup area is further down the counter towards the back of the first floor.  The seating area is upstairs.  The stairs are next to the ordering spot so after you pick up your food, you have to cross the line of ppl waiting to order in order to get to those stairs.  This is fine as long as ppl are paying attention.  I noticed a few times that someone in line is in convo and nearly bumps into someone with hands full of food trying to move past them. Will def come back here if I ever make it back up to Ithaca.

Well I have to admit these girls have cohones for opening a waffle shop right across from the Mate Factory, which takes waffles to the next level.  But since waffles are the new cupcakes - the more the merrier. On Fridays they have Chicken + Waffles (which I think is not offered anywhere else in Ithaca?)  It was awesome - chicken plus waffles plus syrup (or honey or hot sauce).  What's not to love?  I only wished that I had gotten a double order instead of a single.  Their coffee was also pretty excellent.  Oh and doughnuts with fillings!  I got nutella. I didn't really think the food was overly expensive.  Prices are pretty standard for Ithaca, which is always more expensive than you think it should be.

I really dig the concept and the availability of vegan options, but it fell a bit short. I got the Waffle Dog ($5) which is a Jumbo Vegan Smart Dog dipped in vegan waffle batter and fried (on a stick) that comes with Maple Mustard. The mustard was really tasty but the Waffle Dog was really bland. They used a Jumbo Smart Dog and that's really the first mistake. Those things taste almost like nothing and battering and frying them didn't really do anything. Next time I know to get a waffle and skip the dog.

The place is built like an artist's loft with a whole bunch of colors, chalk that lets you draw all over the place, and a second story connected by an iron staircase. It has a fun vibe! Food Review -- Over the few times I've been here I've tried their soups, sandwiches, and most recently, the Ice Cream Sandwich. The food has a Panera Bread sort of feel to it, always toasty and rich. There are many Vegan options out there as well. The Ice Cream sandwich was sweeeeeet. I almost felt guilty eating it because it was loaded with chocolate, caramel, whipped cream and two heaping scoops of ice cream. If you're not in the mood for dessert food, try the chicken options (you can choose to have a single or twin waffle bed). Service Review -- Order your food, pick it up at the counter, and grab yourself a seat! It'd be nice if they brought the food over to you, it really hasn't been that busy the times that I've been there. Overall Impression -- Waffle Frolic's sweet and salty blends of chicken and waffles was a new experience for me a couple years ago and I love the combo. The vegan-friendly and gluten free menu is perfect for anyone with allergies or "picky" eaters. They have labels on all the options and the decor makes you feel right at home.
***BASED ON THE VEGAN OPTIONS**** I ordered the vegan icecream sandwich with excitement and after my first bite, I was very disappointed. The waffle was plain. BORING. You would think that the icecream makes it better. NOPE. The icecream wasn't bad - good texture but again no taste. I ordered the strawberry and vanilla flavor and they both tasted the same (plain = barely anything to it) but had different colors. Portion size - you should share unless you want to get fat or you have a super fast metabolism.
The fried chicken and waffles was my choice based on another review.  Great choice, I might add.  It came with a hot sauce maple syrup.  Trust me, it's better than it sounds.  The sauce wasn't hot really, more of the flavor of hot sauce.  It was something similar to the taste of Texas Pete's.  You get 3 pieces of fried chicken on top of the waffle (see my photo).  I had a mug of hot Nutella which was decent.  It wasn't as hot as I'd like it but it's fine. The waffles come in half or whole.  Honestly, a half is enough for one person.  A full is bigger than a plate. Their layout is a little odd.  The line for ordering begins pretty much near the entrance so it forces ppl in line to have to move whenever someone comes in the door.  The pickup area is further down the counter towards the back of the first floor.  The seating area is upstairs.  The stairs are next to the ordering spot so after you pick up your food, you have to cross the line of ppl waiting to order in order to get to those stairs.  This is fine as long as ppl are paying attention.  I noticed a few times that someone in line is in convo and nearly bumps into someone with hands full of food trying to move past them. Will def come back here if I ever make it back up to Ithaca.
My trip to Waffle Frolic was an exciting adventure for me as I have never eaten a waffle out because of my dairy allergy.  (You gotta love these liberal/hippie/vegan friendly towns!)  So I was pretty excited to see a vegan option on the menu.  I opted for the twin, which was probably unnecessary, but I finished it nonetheless, with maple syrup and fruit compote.  It was pretty delicious.  The waffle was a little crispier than I was expecting, which is probably because it was gluten free in addition to it being vegan.  (I do not usually eat gluten free.  I am not sure how those two categories got lumped together.)   In addition to tasty waffles, this is a nice spot to just chill and read a book.  Service is very efficient and there is plenty of seating upstairs!
Well I have to admit these girls have cohones for opening a waffle shop right across from the Mate Factory, which takes waffles to the next level.  But since waffles are the new cupcakes - the more the merrier. On Fridays they have Chicken + Waffles (which I think is not offered anywhere else in Ithaca?)  It was awesome - chicken plus waffles plus syrup (or honey or hot sauce).  What's not to love?  I only wished that I had gotten a double order instead of a single.  Their coffee was also pretty excellent.  Oh and doughnuts with fillings!  I got nutella. I didn't really think the food was overly expensive.  Prices are pretty standard for Ithaca, which is always more expensive than you think it should be.
Waffles made with love? Yes, please. Lounge chairs and ample space for both the lone customer and groupies chattering about without being squeezed together? Yes, please. Friendly staff who will give you a complementary ice cream when they screw up your order? Yes, please. Fried chicken and waffles? Hell yes. I've got the best of both worlds, and I'm not moving anywhere anytime soon until I've had every piece of meat. In other words: I love WaffleFrolic, and they better be here to stay at the Commons. What Burrito Place?
I really dig the concept and the availability of vegan options, but it fell a bit short. I got the Waffle Dog ($5) which is a Jumbo Vegan Smart Dog dipped in vegan waffle batter and fried (on a stick) that comes with Maple Mustard. The mustard was really tasty but the Waffle Dog was really bland. They used a Jumbo Smart Dog and that's really the first mistake. Those things taste almost like nothing and battering and frying them didn't really do anything. Next time I know to get a waffle and skip the dog.
Have not come to try any of the foods but have had the Chai Milk Shake several times,  I highly recommend this very creamy and flavorful beverage even during an icy Ithaca day.
The waffles: Fried banana, local peanut butter and honey on hearty hemp and buckwheat: very tasty and not too sweet.  Crispy and warm on the outside, fluffy on the inside. All out of fried chicken so we settled on fried eggs and bacon on hemp & buckwheat.  They got the order wrong.  When we asked for it to be corrected they rolled their eyes at making us new eggs instead of putting cold fried eggs (yuck!) on the newly made waffle.  When we finally received our order it was average at best. Overall the service was slow and the staff was rude and irritable.  The place was dirty and disorganized. When I approached one of the owners about how rudely we were treated we only got a defense from her of how her co-owner had treated us.  Something about how they had long lines for 4 hours that morning, that they don't like to waste food, etc.  All I can say is that when we were there at 2:30 in the afternoon there were no lines and three people behind the counter.   Will I be back?  It's hard to say.  3 stars is generous.

Went here cause nothing else looked good! The set up in this place is a bit difficult, since most of the seating is upstairs. I got the Chicken and Waffles, which was pretty good, I've definitely had better, but again, it wasn't bad... My gf ordered the Tomato soup and they gave us chili, but whatever, it was good. The mocha latte was awful... All in all this place is ok, it is mostly teenagers who work here so what do ya expect... Not trying to be agist, but seriously...

I am really a waffle lover. However, this place is disappointing for me. Since they are called waffle frolic, I really expected they will make fantastic waffle... However, comparing to the old teahouse which is right outside campus in collegetown. The waffle at Waffle Frolic is small on both waffle and ice cream. They don't have much stuffs on the waffle except the icecream either. It's more pricy. And it's usually a very long wait for ordering as well as for the waffle, since they are at such a great location.

There is something for everyone here!  I have had the lemon curd, a turkey burger and an ice cream waffle.  All excellent!  I do wish the seating was a little less cold and cafeteria-ish.  Prices are a little high, but not for Ithaca!

Admittedly, the waffles are better at the cafe across the street. However, the food is okay, and it's a good hangout spot.
Bring 2 peeps to devour a Waffle Frolic ice cream sandwich! Two nicely crispy waffles, two big scoops of Purity ice cream (6 flavors to choose from), slathered with freshly whipped cream *and* lashed with chocolate and caramel sauces. Off the hook. Not cheap at $10 and there's a notable wait while they make it. Free ice water upstairs :)
Waffle Frolic is a really interesting idea but lacks the execution to make it a truly unique place. I have had the waffles with eggs and bacon, fried chicken and cornbread waffle with chili. All the components were pretty good, except for the chili. It tasted institutional and boring with no spices or unique complexity. However, there was nothing to tie all the components together into a cohesive dish. The toppings were simply served on top of the waffle. Something like a chipotle hollandaise would be good with the eggs and bacon. A little chicken or sausage gravy would blend the fried chicken with the waffle. The chili should be fresh from scratch and variable. The also, the prices are a bit high for waffles, considering how basic and cheap the ingredients are.

Its not as good as wafels and dinges, but its not bad either. When you walk in, you will smell waffles. Amazing. That will already make you hungry and crave for waffles. They have a few different kinds of waffles. -Buttermilk: ok, that sounds good -Hemp and Buckwheat: sounds scary. I do not eat hemp -Cornbread: sounds amazing -Gluten Free: I don't have that allergy but if you do, this place is great They are really good with labeling everything- whether its gluten free, organic etc. They have a ton of toppings. We opted for bananas and belgium chocolate sauce. You also get powdered sugar and butter for free. If you are health conscious, you can request for Smart Balance instead of butter. They have other healthy options like agave as well.

I was at Cornell for a recruiting event and stopped by for breakfast before hitting the road. As others have stated the service in this place is poor at best. I waked in and was ignored by the snotty kid behind the bar. I was the only person in the place and decided to see how long it would take for him to acknowledge my presence. After about 2 minutes I finally had to demand his attention to place an order. After I ordered he went about organizing some tea containers on the counter instead of making my order. I would have not minded if it wasn't for the fact that 3 or 4 customers came in to order coffee he served them all before starting my order.  There was another worker in the back milling around who could not be bothered to make my order. I am not the type of person who needs there ass kissed at a restaurant but when I am the only person in the place and it takes you 10 minutes to even start my order that is ridiculous. To top it off the waffles were ok At best. I would not go back!

The hearty hemp and buckwheat waffle is delicious and the single waffles are pretty big. If you like sweet things, they have plenty of toppings including ice cream! I like savory better than sweet, it would be nice to see more savory items on the menu like goat cheese, ground sausage or grilled veggies. However, I settled for blueberries and yogurt and was still satisfied.

Great selection of waffles, great coffee, and everyone that worked there was really nice.  I will deffinelty be coming back

I really love this place. They have amazing vegan options (including a vegan corndog!) and the upstairs area is a great spot to sip tea and read/do some work. It is also locally owned and they use lots of local/organic fruit and produce. Highly highly recommended!

So I finally stumbled into this place when I was originally going to the first indoor farmers market of the 2011 season. I was expecting tasty Cambodian food, but to my horror the indoor farmers market doesn't have the Cambodian food stand :0. So I started back on my treck home in the snow, uphill, and super hungry. When I passed by this waffle place I couldn't help myself to at least read the menu. And well they had me at fried chicken and waffles. I haven't had this combo since I dined at Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles in Los Angeles. At Frolics, for 9$ you get three pieces of fried, free range chicken (1 thigh, 1 portion of a breast, and full wing with the drumlet, the flat part of the wing, and the tip). This is served over a buttered, butter milk waffle with maple hot sauce on the side. The hot sauce was delectable with the chicken, but especially with the waffle. Frankly the chicken was a bit dry though so I can't give them 4 stars. Fried chicken and waffles is a classic combination and I am grateful that a place in Ithaca finally serves this. I do think making syrup a topping you pay for at a waffle place is a bit silly, but everything is local, and organic and they have a lot of vegan friendly options. They compost almost everything and they even have free wifi

Cool place and good waffles...  okay expresso / coffee. The single waffle serving (of any combo) was sufficient for one person..,,   the 2 waffle (twin) size was a little too big for one serving.   They have a lot of varieties but everything is basically a waffle (or 2) on the bottom with stuff on top of it.   I had the bacon and egg and it was a nice lunch for me.  They have limited non-waffle items but I did not see anyone ordered them while I was there.

Sometimes, you have a craving, and the only thing that can satisfy it is a GIANT DELICIOUS WAFFLE. I'm not a huge lover of breakfast foods, but I can't describe how giddy I get to go to Waffle Frolic--it's like being five years old again. The hard part is deciding what you want on your waffle. The waffles are good enough to be eaten absolutely plain, but where is the fun in that? Choose a waffle (buttermilk, hearty hemp and buckwheat, cornbread, or gluten free/vegan) and size (single is probably more than enough, unless you've just run a marathon...or are sharing) and then either take your pick from their massive list of delectable toppings or choose one of the sweet or savory options already on the menu. The Ice Cream Sandwich is gorge-your-face amazing: two scoops of Purity ice cream (your choice of flavors), whipped cream, chocolate sauce, and caramel sauce. The Elvis (peanut butter, honey, and bananas) is also divine. Apparently Waffle Frolic also serves non-waffle items, but...it's called Waffle Frolic. Why would I want anything other than a waffle?

We liked it so much that we were there for both breakfast and dinner.  The kids loved the gluten-free waffles one had it with bananas and the other with peanut butter.  I prefer my waffles a bit softer but the kids didn't mind that they were really crunchy. For dinner we came back and had the waffle dogs for the kiddos and the Frolic grilled cheese for me.  Again, good eats!!

Ok, by the time I actually got my waffle, I was starved and would have probably eaten almost anything, however, the service and setup of this place is really atrocious.  There is literally nowhere to stand while waiting and by the time you actually get to the counter, you are met by surly and confused staff personnel.  We were there with a large group, which is why we could not leave.  I have to admit, however, that the waffle (hemp and buckwheat with walnuts and granola) was delicious; crisp and sweet.  Was it worth the wait -- I don't think so!

This place is above a 4 but not quite a 5.  I've been probably five times, and everything was very consistent all five times. Food: The waffles are very tasty!!  I have tried both the buttermilk and the buckwheat-hemp waffles.  The buttermilk ones are good, better than your average waffle.  I prefer the buckwheat-hemp ones though because there is a little more flavor to them.  They offer nutella and fresh fruit....mmm...... Service: The people behind the counter have always been extremely friendly. (FYI, no table service available) Atmosphere: I'm not a big fan of the way the inside is set up.  The walls and colors are very cool, but the seating upstairs is a little awkward.

Overall impression:  Cute place & neat concept. The buttermilk waffles are very tasty, especially with syrup and fresh fruit (strawberries and blueberries)  atop. Also, the fried chicken & waffle IS as fantastic as it sounds.  Not sure I was a huge fan of sauce it came with, though. The people behind the counter were friendly and the barista definitely can whip up a great latte.  I'd go back.  There are many other items on the menu that caught my eye that I want to try...

I am tempted to knock them down a star because of inconsistent service, but the food is just lovely. They have gluten free and vegan options, and the food is great. I personally like the grilled cheese with vegan "cheese." It's not the easiest order to pull off, and Waffle Frolic manages it. The gluten free waffles are nice, and they even make a decent macchiato.  You can stare at the people on the Commons from the second floor while you eat. They have water available, and every time I've been there it's easy to find a seat. This is one of my favorite brunch spots in Ithaca at the moment.

Only in college towns do I find places like this and I wish there were more!  This place can do anything with a waffle.  Soooo many options for toppings from the sweet to the savory.  First time here and I had the chicken and buckwheat waffle.. I freeking love it!!  Very unique with great service and an upstairs eating area with a couch for lounging if you please.  Check this place out.. I doubt you would be disappointed.

What a disappointment.  After reading all of the very positive reviews I can only assume now that they were all written by the owners of this establishment.  What a rip off. A single waffle is now $3.00, then you have to add on ingredients.  However, it is very deceptive pricing.  I got one single waffle with eggs/bacon.  it stated that the eggs/bacon/waffle was $7.50, although lo and behold the total price became $10.50 - an outrageous price for what turned out to be two eggs, two floppy strips of bacon and a waffle.  I can only imagine that the cashier added it up incorrectly.  Even if it had been the most amazing thing I had eaten it would not have justified the high price tag. The fact that they charge these prices and then expect that you will come and get your food and take it upstairs is  crazy.  Additionally, their condiments/napkins/silverware, etc. are downstairs.  Which, if you are new to the restaurant you don't realize until you are *upstairs* with your food.  There were syrup and salt and pepper upstairs but they were not easily seen. All in all a fairly disappointing experience.  The cost for my husband, two children and I was well over $30 and my two kids only got a plain waffle with maple syrup and milk each.   A great concept but needs some serious work on pricing, plating of food, and environment.  With all of the great places to go to eat in Ithaca we will not be returning. Should have gone to the waffle place across the street -- looked like we would have been better off.

Always have loved breakfast.  Then when I had a daughter with a milk allergy, it made it difficult to eat out at a breakfast restaurant, but do-able sometimes.  Then came the must be gluten free diagnosis.  Now breakfast out was pretty much not going to happen. eggs without toast and no syrupy treats.  boo.  Then comes Waffle Frolic.  If I lived in Ithaca, I would be a regular.  So great.  Great laid back atmosphere.  Fantastic fresh wholesome menu and man choices including Vegan/Dairy Free and Gluten Free!! Yey!  And on top of it all, the best GF waffles I have ever had!

I've become a semi-regular here. Each waffle type I've tried (buttermilk, hemp & buckwheat, etc) has been delicious. At the beginning there were some differences in portion sizes for the a la carte toppings, especially peanut butter. I've become a big fan of their savory waffles so I can't say whether that in particular has improved, but the savory waffles are very consistently made and a good value.
Only in college towns do I find places like this and I wish there were more!  This place can do anything with a waffle.  Soooo many options for toppings from the sweet to the savory.  First time here and I had the chicken and buckwheat waffle.. I freeking love it!!  Very unique with great service and an upstairs eating area with a couch for lounging if you please.  Check this place out.. I doubt you would be disappointed.
I am quite a fan of waffles. I maintain that this trait is genetic (my mom was always the manager of my youth hockey teams and often chose hotels for away games based on whether or not the hotel's continental breakfast included a  belgian waffle maker).  For this reason I was really excited to try Waffle Frolic but was underwhelmed.  I am a fan of fluffy waffles, while these were fairly thin and crispy.  Instead of soaking up butter and syrup it sat on top.  It sorta reminded me of a waffle shaped cracker.  The eggs and bacon were good on the side.  The prices seemed high for the quality of the food, particularly the toppings (the local syrup is seventy five cents for a small cup, though they have free regular syrup on the counter.) Overall I was not very impressed.
What a disappointment.  After reading all of the very positive reviews I can only assume now that they were all written by the owners of this establishment.  What a rip off. A single waffle is now $3.00, then you have to add on ingredients.  However, it is very deceptive pricing.  I got one single waffle with eggs/bacon.  it stated that the eggs/bacon/waffle was $7.50, although lo and behold the total price became $10.50 - an outrageous price for what turned out to be two eggs, two floppy strips of bacon and a waffle.  I can only imagine that the cashier added it up incorrectly.  Even if it had been the most amazing thing I had eaten it would not have justified the high price tag. The fact that they charge these prices and then expect that you will come and get your food and take it upstairs is  crazy.  Additionally, their condiments/napkins/silverware, etc. are downstairs.  Which, if you are new to the restaurant you don't realize until you are *upstairs* with your food.  There were syrup and salt and pepper upstairs but they were not easily seen. All in all a fairly disappointing experience.  The cost for my husband, two children and I was well over $30 and my two kids only got a plain waffle with maple syrup and milk each.   A great concept but needs some serious work on pricing, plating of food, and environment.  With all of the great places to go to eat in Ithaca we will not be returning. Should have gone to the waffle place across the street -- looked like we would have been better off.
Fried chicken with waffles is actually delicious.
Always have loved breakfast.  Then when I had a daughter with a milk allergy, it made it difficult to eat out at a breakfast restaurant, but do-able sometimes.  Then came the must be gluten free diagnosis.  Now breakfast out was pretty much not going to happen. eggs without toast and no syrupy treats.  boo.  Then comes Waffle Frolic.  If I lived in Ithaca, I would be a regular.  So great.  Great laid back atmosphere.  Fantastic fresh wholesome menu and man choices including Vegan/Dairy Free and Gluten Free!! Yey!  And on top of it all, the best GF waffles I have ever had!
The menu is very unique, and the waffles hit the mark....nice intimate decor inside the building and the service was warm and friendly.  Almost too friendly, inviting us back for "group discussions", which was a tad strange.  I left there satisfied with my meal....and the fact that I wasn't initiated into a cult on the spot.  Definitely worth a try for the strong-willed!
I've become a semi-regular here. Each waffle type I've tried (buttermilk, hemp & buckwheat, etc) has been delicious. At the beginning there were some differences in portion sizes for the a la carte toppings, especially peanut butter. I've become a big fan of their savory waffles so I can't say whether that in particular has improved, but the savory waffles are very consistently made and a good value.
Lots of fun for families, with everyone able to order their own special waffle-y treat!  A hit with the pre-teen crowd.

Stopped in here for a post-dinner dessert treat and we were not disappointed.  Had the Ice Cream Sandwich which was at least 6 scoops of ice cream sandwiched between two waffles that was topped with whipped cream and chocolate and caramel sauces.  My girlfriend said it was her new favorite dessert and we enjoyed it in the very eclectic dining environment.  Great menu offerings from the otherwise "normal" fare in downtown and we certainly will be back!

i liked the ice cream with waffles! seats are not conformable otherwise a good place for a afternoon novel time.

I love this place. Staff: super friendly. Coffee: great options. Smoothies: fresh fruit! Waffles: perfectly crispy and great variety. I hope they come to NYC.

I went here the other day around noon with my toddler.  I was underwhelmed by the whole experience.  For being a brand new shop, the staff wasn't very eager to help me with my order.  I didn't see anything written that the waffles come with butter and syrup, so I ended up paying a dollar for a very small portion of real maple syrup only to find a container of the fake stuff sitting on the station behind me.  The waffles were good enough, but I found the price a little high for what we got.  Since it is a waffle restaurant, I'm going to mark this as "good for kids", but be warned that it was nearly impossible to fit my stroller in the front door and almost all the seating is upstairs. with no elevator.

The food was OK. Although breakfast items not so great (soggy bacon!). The dining experience was sketchy. The waffle cook, who was plainly visible from the order line, did not have her ample hair covered and proceeded to scratch her head over the batter and flipping waffles with the same hand. The majority of seating area is upstairs, which can be tricky to get to with hands full of paper plates and cups.
Excellent waffles, great staff.
I finally tried Waffle Frolic this past weekend.  The vegan waffle is delicious and the staff seems happy and very nice.  I will be returning in the future to try their other vegan options (vegan grilled cheese, among others!).  The real maple syrup was delicious and the portion was perfect.   This is my new favorite place on The Commons!

I'm from Cleveland, but my friend who studies at IC brought me here while I was visiting.  I loved the options for toppings and that they had a vegan waffle!  I had a single vegan waffle with local maple syrup and shredded coconut.  It was definitely tasty, but maybe a little crunchy to be a proper fancy waffle.  The atmosphere was cute, but maybe a little lacking.  Laid back with lots of space to chill out and a community bookshelf, but the decor was on the dull side- amateur photography and uninspired furnishings.  I usually don't care about those things that much, but I just feel like the space has potential that it's not -quite- living up to.  All in all, a fun novelty treat spot great for relaxing with friends.

The food was ok but the staff was horrible. The line didn't move well. No one smiled. And then they messed up my order so I had to wait more than 30 minutes for a couple of waffles. No notice. No apologies. These kids need some adult supervision.

I've eaten here twice and both times the waffles were fabulous, but the coffee service was extremely poor. Beyond slow, and made by staff who seemed like they couldn't care less. Our two cappucinos were of widely varying quality. It is like the place is staffed by a bunch of in-group cool kids who find the idea of customers a bit beneath them. It is a shame, because the location is perfect and the waffles are good. I might give them one more try, but there is so much good food in Ithaca that poor service just isn't worth the hassle.

I always get the Cornbread and Chili waffle. It is AMAZING. The portion size is more than satisfactory and it's simply delicious. It's not cheap but I'm full when I leave and sometimes I have extra to take home. I'll also get a latte or a cappuccino. The baristas are really friendly, and they usually make something pretty in my coffee. I spend a lot of time here studying and have never once had an issue with the food or atmosphere.  I think it's ludicrous that people have such issue with the prices. You get what you pay for...there is an actual drawing on the wall with the size of the waffles to avoid any confusion.

A must visit spot in the Ithaca area! The frolic (as frequent guest call it) sports a varied menu with fun options for breakfast, lunch, and dinner many of which can accommodate gluten-free, vegetarian or vegan needs. The atmosphere is fun and relaxed and they just expanded next door which means more room and seating. The maple hot sauce (combo hot sauce, maple syrup, and other secret ingredients) is bar none. Sweet waffles like the banana split or ice cream sandwich will blow you away. I would highly recommend this cute little Waffle House/Coffee Bar to tourists and locals alike!
Upsides: Tasty! Vegan options! Fresh fruit on the waffles! Cool art on the walls. Games & books upstairs for kids. Downsides: Expensive. Slow service. Really loud/echo-y upstairs so if your kids are sensitive to noise, go elsewhere.
InFuckingCredible!!!! You can't ever go wrong with waffles. It's amazing how much stuff you can put on one. Everyone here is also super friendly... If your here you must come to WaffleFrolic!
Insane waiting time to order! 8am on Sat morn. Too slow. Had a good product. But flow rate for service was tough. Must have patience!

This place actually deserves a four-star but it's really too expensive! The waffle is amazing but half of a waffle with banns and ice cream costs 8dollars! The service is also slow.

I am seriously staving angry that I was not afforded the opportunity to frolic with my pretty decent waffle and tea.

While running errands on the Ithaca Commons, I stopped in at Waffle Frolic for, you guessed it, a waffle. The plain waffle with butter and maple syrup was good.  I'd give it three or four stars.  However, my overall rating for this place is two stars as the service is MADDENINGLY HORRIBLE! There weren't many customers the morning I came in, so I was surprised when I was told to order at the other end of the counter.  Since when does it matter where I place an order from? After correcting my counter placement, the staff then went on to ignore me, now standing at the correct end of the counter, mind you, for the next 3-4 minutes, as they supposedly worked on other items in the back. At last, I could order.  I did so.  But then, I had to wait at the counter for another five minutes or more just for the staff to provide my mug of hot cider.  In-between the time that I placed the order and received the beverage, multiple other customers had been helped.  Why not just give me the damn cider? At last, I had my cider in hand, but then I had to wait another five minutes for my simple waffle order to be called out. Fifteen minutes (plus!) in, I could finally walk upstairs with my food and enjoy my waffle. In short, if you don't have a lot of patience then I would steer clear of this place!!! The waffle isn't good enough for me to tolerate that absolutely awful service again.

Quite an interesting place; great food and great service! It's a little echoey inside, and the setup is a bit strange, but the atmosphere is great, and I think the prices are fair. For those of you who care to visit, you order your food at the cashier, not directly from the people who make it (which is normally how people order food at places like this). Another great part of this place: it's extremely environmentally conscious, and there are plenty options for vegans and vegetarians.

Waffle was tasty but not worth the 30 minute wait at the counter. I wouldn't bother to go back.

I come here nearly every weekend I'm in Ithaca and order a relatively basic waffle and coffee. Both are surprisingly delicious treats; I was surprised by how consistently good the coffee is, in fact. At first, service was a bit scattershot, but the management seem to have gotten a hang of things and it's improved immensely over the last year. Word is, Waffle Frolic has actually been so successful that they're expanding into the space next door. That's especially good news because I've never been a fan of the joint's layout: most of the seating is upstairs, requiring a shuffle down to grab your order (or a long wait before even going after a table) and then a careful walk up with what might be multiple cups and/or plates. I think the upper floor, where most of patrons eat their food, has also suffered from some neglect - something about the seating upstairs looked both a bit cheap and/or tired even from day one and could use some more sprucing up, though I see that the stools next to the second-story windows have been improved, which shows they're attending to the issue. This space also looks like it could stand to be more frequently cleaned, too, or at least freshened up paintwise. And while I like the idea of the library hidden in a back corner, but it almost seems like someone's forgotten, just-exposed closet: it should be expanded and highlighted more.
