I have been going here for a couple of years now, before they changed names. Hot stone pedicures are awesome! Gel manicures are nice as well. Prices are reasonable and the staff is very nice. All very attentive and want you to leave happy!
Went for the first time as a friend referred me for my wedding this weekend. They had no idea what I was saying when I said I just wanted gel nails. They had different gel options & couldn't explain them to us. Cut two of my girls twice & shaped them both wrong. Other than that the employees were friendly & they offer massages while your waiting for nails to dry!
