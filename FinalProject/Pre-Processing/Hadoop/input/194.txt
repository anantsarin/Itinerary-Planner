More helpful and intense than any program I have been a part of in the past. The coaches are always willing to answer my questions about what I am doing, and frequently check in on everyone in class to make sure everyone has good form and not going to cause self injury. They play awesome music during classes and I feel like I am really getting something out of it every time I go. No hiding from your work out on the treadmill at this gym.
Stopped in while in town for work.  Great, friendly people.  Very welcoming and helpful.  Good for all skill levels.
Awesome staff and great atmosphere, they have definitely taken fitness for me to the next level.
I am involved in the CrossFit community a lot and I must say that CrossFit Boomtown is TOP NOTCH! The trainers there really know their curriculum and have skills you won't find at any other gym around. I highly suggest you stop in and try out one of their free work outs and see what the CrossFit sensation is all about!
