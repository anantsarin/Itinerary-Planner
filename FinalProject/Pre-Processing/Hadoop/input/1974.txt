When it comes to AUTHENTIC Mexican cuisine (and I've been to Mexico a handful of times) this place is golden!!  Absolutely no frills (don't look for great ambiance here), and not much English spoken (gives me a chance to practice mi espanol), but who cares when the food is as real and tasty as what I recall my from Mexican adventures to Puerto Vallarta, Cancun and Mexico City?   Big thumbs up for this joint in the city of Poughkeepsie!! BTW- this establishment has been in business at this same location for at least 14 years that I am aware of.  I'm employed locally and from the area.
Excellent plates, huge burritos.... great food. Purely latin american clientele. Not to be missed if you're in the mood for some more authentic tastes. If you do not speak spanish, expect to do a lot of pointing at menus.
Craving Mexican food on a the Sunday night before midterms, I turned to Yelp to find a place that would just bring dinner to me. This was the place to choose. While their online menu was pretty confusing to read, the delivery minimum was $15, on the low side for the area, so I was sold. The chimichangas were good - a little too much uncooked tortilla at the ends for me, but the flautas were the star. Both very inexpensive meals were topped with a guacamole that was filled with cilantro - so good! Top it off with waiting less than a half hour for delivery and an included bag of chips and side of salsa, this is one place I'll be ordering from more often.
This place is a complete HOLE IN THE WALL. But, it's truly authentic. The first time I was here, the menu was only in Spanglish and the sweet lady at the counter understood nada but was willing to give us everything. The food is super. It's nothing like taco bell and everything like Oaxaca. Can't beat the prices. To be perfectly honest I can't say whether or not we go the meal we ordered but whatever it was that we got, I want more. If you're in town, just do it.
Not much new to add: authentic, hole in the wall, cheap and great. The boy lived in Oaxaca for a few summers back in college, and the food is true to what he remembers there. it's a much more colorful experience if you understand Spanish and can listen in as all the guys sitting at the bar/counter get progressively drunker and raunchier in their conversations. Mole was great, guac was cilantro laden, just like the boy likes it, portions were generous, beer was plentiful.
After the quest to find a good Mexican place in Poughkeepsie I think I have finally found one! Mole Mole leaves much to be desired and Fresco Tortilla is good but way too salty. El Bracero is def a hole in the wall and may not have the most alluring decor but the food was amazing! Very little English is spoken but the service is very friendly!
A friendly no-frills place with a variety of Mexican plates (we couldn't discern any specific regional specialties, though they do have a fair amount of seafood on the menu)   We started out with a side order/appetizer portion of nopales-- it wasn't on the menu, but when we saw that they had a special of steak with nopales, we asked if we could just get a side order of nopales and they happily complied.  They were warm (and still somewhat pleasantly slimy), sauteed with some tomatoes and epazote, with some raw onion and cilantro.  Could have used a little more spice or onion, but overall a nice side. For main dishes we got tacos, and Oaxacan-style tacos enchilados with mole sauce.  Many of their items come with choice of filling: cheese, meat, spinach, mushrooms, or potato, making them more vegetarian-friendly than the typical Mexican place.  The tacos were quite standard-- meat was tender, and came with sides of onions, cilantro, and sauce to dress them up.  The enchiladas come covered in mole, onions, and cheese, in authentic Oaxacan style.  The potato filling was kind of bland, but the spinach is cooked with onions and epazote, and the mushrooms were also tasty.  Unfortunately, the mole was very sweet and not particularly spicy-- I personally prefer somewhat more spice, and less sweet.  I suspect, given that mole doesn't figure prominently anywhere else on the menu, that it's not really a specialty of theirs (perhaps even from a mix? I usually associate sweet mole with mix, but maybe that's unfair) Overall, we thought the food was quite good.  I still prefer La Cabanita for their Oaxacan specialties, but El Bracero is going into the rotation!
This place is THE BOMB.  By far the best Mexican food in Poughkeepsie.  (I'm looking at you, Mole Mole.)  All of the entrees are interesting and authentic.  The salsa verde on the enchiladas ($6) was refreshingly tangy, and the mole sauce on the Enchiladas de Oaxaca ($7) was top notch.  The tostadas and quesadillas ($6 each) are good -- go for spicy pork if you eat it.  My favorite thing there is the tacos, however.  ($6?  How can they afford to give you free chips and salsa?) You get three large tacos which come with a generous caddy full of salsa, cilantro, and onions.   If you go here, however, you -have- to get the Nachos a la Mexicanos con puerco ($5.50, feeds 3 generously) .  Spicy, just-chewy strips of marinated pork on top of a bed of homemade chips, beans, melted cheese, topped with strips of fried queso fresco and grilled jalapenos:  these are bar none the best nachos I've ever had the chance to enjoy.   Their horchata is a little bland but the agua del dia is usually good, and an (approximately) 24 oz glass is only $1.50.  Of course, I'd go with a Modelo most of the time.
Ate here for the first time the other night and was happy, happy, happy.  Upstate NY is pretty much a wasteland for authentic Mexican, but El Bracero is the real deal.  Very little English spoken here, Mexican soccer blaring on the TV, simple booths and tables, but who cares, the food is great, cheap and authentic.   My sweetie and I started with some pork tacos off the specials board and they were great, pork mixed with potato and a Verde sauce served on soft fresh tortillas ($6).  It came with a huge bowl of fresh salsa (lots of cilantro, yum) freshly made chips and a fixings dish with raw onion, cilantro, and hot sauce.  Mmmm.   We then each had a combo plate ($6.50) with three choices (six total for the both of us) including the enchiladas Oaxaca (sweet mole sauce), enchiladas with green and red sauce, chalupa and flauta.  Each was delicious and we left stuffed for only $19 not including a few Tecates. I loved they way the cook in the back banged a pot or some sort of bell when a order was ready.  By the end of dinner he had trained me to start salivating every time I heard the gong. If you like a fancy atmosphere forget this place.  If you just love Taco Bell, then go there.  But if you love authentic home made Mexican that will leave you happily satisfied then head over to El Bracero.
I was in Poughkeepsie at dinnertime and decided to eat here based on Yelp reviews. The place was not dead, but quiet, with a few regulars at the bar watching Mexican soccer. The food was all right.  My shrimp quesadilla was flavorful but messy to eat: plenty of baby shrimp, big chunks of mushroom, not too much cheese. It could have used a sauce aside from sour cream and a few dabs of guacamole. The beans were good but the rice tasted funny. The server was pleasant and helpful.
Stopped in here on a Saturday afternoon. We totally missed the sign and had to do a quick U-turn after our phone yelled at us. Restaurant had a large amount of seating, which was partially filled by mostly families and locals. Specials were goat based, with barbacoa tacos, or a goat soup which was pretty tasty. Had the Oaxican Enchiladas with a black mole sauce which was great. Friend had a veg. sampler where you choose 3 items for 6 bucks. Another had the goat taco's which were pretty good. Service was a little slow but very friendly, they speak English fine so don't let that scare you away? I'm definitely planning on eating here again.
This was my first trip here. I'm doing some work in the city and asked Siri to find me a Mexican restaurant. This one had great reviews, and I had driven right by it a few times without noticing the place ! I had some steak dish with two eggs ontop and guacamole and beans, fantastic. They start you out with chips and salsa as well. Good place, will be back.
