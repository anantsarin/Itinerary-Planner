We were members of the DCT during our last several years in Rochester and we attended many wonderful, memorable and varied types of shows.  We thoroughly enjoyed all of them, and there was even one New Year's Eve when we attended a performance followed by a party.  The DCT's indefatigable director - Chris Kawolsky - is truly an amazing person and I think he must work about 24 hours/day.
I have been fortunate enough to see several performances at DCT when I am in Rochester, and I have never been disappointed.  It is a live performance theatre, intimate setting, so the audience is close to all of the action.  The talent is terrific, and when you can combine great entertainment with decadent desserts, what could be better.   If you have ever worked a job, you will love  'Water Coolers'.  Lots of belly laughs!  Ditto for 'I Love You, You're Perfect, Now Change', a play about relationships.  Be sure to check out DCT!  It is a gem.
I've always been entertained by the energetic and often hilarious shows at Downstairs Cabaret Theatre. It's definitely on my list of places that I check in and every now and again to see what's playing. Some of my fave shows over the years are the lovable Calamari Sisters, I Love You You're Perfect Now Change and Water Coolers. The tickets are very affordable and I can pretty much guarantee that the shows will be engrossing. Sometimes the blurbs about the shows sound kooky and kind of off-the-wall and you'll wonder how good or funny they actually are in reality. I'm here to tell you that, yes, they're good, and yes, normal (well somewhat, if you consider me) people go to them. Check it out!
