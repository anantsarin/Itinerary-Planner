Anchor Bar? It relies on its legacy. Duffs? Please, their fries are better than their wings. If you're in Buffalo and want the best wings of your life, go to Elmo's. During college, my pals and I used to go here once a month. It would've been a weekly trip but our college-student pockets were as deep as a haiku written by Miley Cyrus. I started to go more often when I became of legal age, and it was there that I was introduced to one of history's most unbreakable duets; wings and beer. I can still taste the honey-dijon wings and Killians in my mouth. You can't go wrong with any of their flavor varieties; I always went with cajun and honey-dijon.
We ate there last week during a x-country trip because a friend gave us the recommendation.  We ordered a 20 piece plate of wings split between hot buffalo style and Cajun.  The buffalo wings were great, but the Cajun were FANTASTIC!!  I would highly recommend this place and their Cajun wings.  The Labbat's was also cold and delicious.
+ Excellent wings!, great service -  Dive-bar decor, poor bathrooms Went here today for wings at 4:30pm.  The place is part of a strip mall just north of UB.  Upon entering the place, the bar is dead centre, with two rooms on each side with windows. There was hardly anyone in the place except for a few guests taking a break from wedding activities. The place looks pretty old inside with torn seat cushions, the whole place dark inside, but doesn't feel dirty, until you use the bathrooms--they need work.   Now onto the good stuff.  The waitress was super friendly and set us up with drinks and menus.  We ordered a double order of wings, 1/2 Medium, 1/2 BBQ.  We had to wait 25 minutes for the wings but they were well worth the wait.  Piping hot, just enough sauce, and nice and crispy. It's nice getting wings done right and not having to put in the standard request of "extra crispy".  The BBQ wings were grilled. Both tasted amazing, these guys really know what they are doing.  Nice tasting blue cheese too.  $19.50 for the double wings isn't too bad as well. Can't wait to go back to try the Hot and Cajun!
So...  I think the chicken here is better than Duffs or anywhere else, but I really like the variety of sauces at BWW.  The interior is like a time machine... going back to... ghetto.  I typically get my chicken dry with the sauce on the side... I'm thinking it may be worthwhile to order just the chicken and use my wife's Korean style marinade at home.
I am from New York City, and I can say these are hands down the BEST wings I have ever had, thus far. I got 10 wings, half BBQ and half Honey Mustard and I also ordered mozzarella sticks. It seemed like a sin to not finish all of the delicious wings in one sitting but I got full so I took some of mine to go. They were equally as delicious the second time around. I thought the prices were reasonable and the atmosphere on a Friday evening was nice and lively. You can tell people love this place because the restaurant was almost full at 6pm. I have also been to Duff's before, but now that I've tried Elmo's I would say Elmo's is definitely the way to go for an amazing wing experience.
If you're visiting Buffalo in search of its namesake wings .. look no further than Elmo's.  If only I knew about their amazing honey mustard wings sooner, I would've spared my parents from the dry, flavorless wings at Anchor Bar when they came to help me move into my dorm.  Don't make the same mistake I did.  The only thing they tell people about Buffalo is that "there's a lot of snow."
This is what you get when furry fluffy puppets on Sesame Street decide to open eateries and bars. Which is what I also said when reviewing Grover's on Transit. This place was formerly St. Elmo's and sold only unleavened bread and the blood of Christ, it nailed lots of headlines when it was made famous in the tragic St Elmo's Fire of the 1980s. The Saint died, but the place was rebuilt, hence it is now only called Elmo's. I heard nothing but great things about their Wings and their Souvlaki. Both are pretty pricey so I was hoping it would be worth it. So far I've only tried their Souvlaki and it was one of the most bland, white-bred, unimaginative and tasteless Souvlakis I've ever had. It was to Souvlakis what Taco Bell is to Tacos. I'm hoping their wings are much better. Elmo's is mainly a drinking establishment. Some places that are mainly for alcohol also happen to have incredible food, but I tried the signature dish that everyone raved about (the vastly overpriced Chicken Souvlaki Pita Pocket), and it wasn't even close to being one of my favourite Souvlakis in town, in fact I found it to be the most bland, the most generic, and the least Greek souvlaki I'd tasted. Their other dish of choice is supposed to be their wings, so I do plan to swing back by and try their (overpriced) wings at some point. But for now, based on their Souvlaki and prices and service alone, this place is one of those very very few family businesses that I will award less than a three to. Combining the hype, the expectation, the prices, and how much I didn't like my sandwich, giving it the usual 3 for a poor family owned restaurant, would be too much. Edit: Since I wrote this I have tried the wings, and while they were good, I can't even remember how good, so until I try them again I am keeping St. Elmo's fire as a 3. A 1983, to be exact. Perhaps if Kermit The Frog joins forces with them, it could be a different story.
Fly into town late on a snowy night and nothing, I mean nothing is open.  Using our favorite "go to app" Yelp, we find Elmo's.  The Holy Grail of wings.  Did I say the wings were awesome??  I guarantee, repeat GUARANTEE, these are the best wings in Buffalo.  As a matter of fact I've never had better wings anywhere on the planet.   All I can say is, "I'm not sayin', just sayin' " these wings will blow you away!
The restaurant itself is a little dark and dirty feeling...but the wings are arguably the best you will get in Buffalo.  The Cajun are my favorite.  The BBQ wings are charred and have a nice smokey flavor to them.  The honey mustard wings are also good if you are in to that kind of stuff.
Good wings, cajun rub is good.   A little over cooked, but good wings.  The place is a dive bar.  Nothing fancy.   Staff was so-so.  Wings are not bad, but i have had better.
Elmo's came recommended as the best wings in the town that originated the food. I've had wings all over the US and these rate mediocre at best: dry, a few were cold, too much sauce. The only reason for the 2 stars is the waitress was pleasant and attentive. No reason to rush here.
Had the buffalo chicken wrap....pretty good, not amazing, but pretty good.
The wings are good but not the best I've had. No real beer selection. Decent service and cheap prices. Defiantly seems like a family owned bar with mostly regulars for customers.
The worst wing I ever had, probably we arrived a little bit late but more one hour to close, all the wings am were over cooked, the sever never ask me to refill my drink. It's really a bad experience here
To have the best wings, you need three things: 1) Outstanding sauce - whether is a dry rub of some kind, or a buffalo sauce, it's gotta be good. I can tell if you're just doing a cheap generic hot sauce-mixed-with-butter hack job. 2) Crispy skin - something that makes the wing soggy on the outside gets a thumbs down 3) Tender meat - if it's dry and needs lots of sauce to help, I'm not impressed I first came here during my college days and remembered it having good wings. I came again recently during a trip to western New York. First, it's still dark and dank inside. It was really cold and had that dungeon sort of feel to it. I was here for lunch, so the only light that was available was from the bar area and the limited sunlight from a typical overcast day in Buffalo... I went for the honey mustard wings, cajun, and medium wings. All three had excellent sauces. The honey mustard wasn't too sweet and had a nice tang to it. The cajun was a dry rub and was flavorful. The medium wings were saucy but not too saucy. All three also had very good crispy skin to them. The honey mustard probably is the best out of all three. The wing/beer deal is pretty nice. The only drawback to all three wings was that they were somewhat dry inside, perhaps less so with the honey mustard. You need to help them out with some blue cheese. That's the only reason (a big one albeit) Elmo's doesn't get 5-stars. The onion rings were excellent. None of them were clumped together, which I appreciate. The rings were golden brown on the outside, while being soft on the inside.   Service was decent as the server was friendly and fairly attentive. Once Elmo's manages to get the wings tender, they can take on the big boys.
Pretty good service. Pretty good food. Pretty good wings- not a large variety. Cajun wings tested best. One thing was the floor was noticeably sticky. I think part if it was outdoor carpeting but it was sticky , and I imagine it was stale beer. This place was more of a bar than a restaurant.
WINGS WINGS WINGS HOCKEY BEER WINGS. You hear it so much. Tourists coming to Buffalo like we are some wing loving, half-alcoholic hockey town. I would posit that although there are some wing loving (myself included) folk who enjoy a nice beer, there's much more to Buffalo culture than wings, beer and sports. There's Cheerios too...see. We love being proud of smelling like cereal ;)! Let's get back to that question we hear so much from guests visiting our city. "Duff's or Anchorbar, man?!" The correct answer from a true Buffalonian is "Neither!" These hidden bars and pubs you see scattered so much throughout our city? Some of them have truly friggin-amazing wings. It's a fun journey to discover some of the tastiest. Elmo's definitely makes it to my personal top 10. I went out of my way to pick up wings here after an outing to Greg's U-Pick gathering blueberries and raspberries (see, we love berry picking in B'lo too!) To sample their goods, I ordered 5 wings medium and the other 5 with their popular Cajun rub. Drove to my friends house excited to try them after all the Yelp reviews I read about this place. The verdict? Pretty damn good. Personally, I didn't dig the cajun rub too much (but you'll love it if you're a fan of dry rubs), but the medium wings were amazing. Perfectly crisp and with a great sauce that makes your brain flood with dopamine with every bite. Yum, yum. They wings weren't huge here, but they were a nice size (Bar Bill still is #1 in size, sauce and everything but that's so far away!). Damn good wings. If you're a University student at UB, you're in luck. Elmo's is like a five minute drive away from you. If only I knew what I knew now back when I was in college...
Ok, I love chicken wings. I have had them all over the country. Let me take you back to my first visit to Elmo's. but first, I have been to Anchor Bar (tourist trap) but a true wing aficionado has to say that theybvisited the birthplace of the buffalo wing at least once! I have also had Duff's very good.  But back to Elmo's. My first visit was in 2003. I went with a coworker who swore by the place. Location is horrible. Strip mall - dated next to some taco place that doesn't look too appealing. We go in, it's dark but doesn't look too clean. The place wreaks of cigarette smoke. (Back when smoking inside was still legal) We sat at the bar because my coworker had become friends with Adam one of the bartenders.  My buddy orders first, a double and a pitcher.  He orders 1/2 Buffalo style and 1/2 Cajun. I look at him incredulously.  He has just committed the greatest sin... Ordering Cajun wings?!  In Buffalo?!  I ordered a double, hot.  We also ordered fries to share. Beers is cold, I can see Adam through the thick smoke.  They don't have any dark beers but that's okay.  The wings and fries arrive and we start to chow down.  My buddy keeps offering me a Cajun, I decline. Hot wings are awesome. Fries are excellent. Celery is limp and not fresh but I'm not here for the celery! Every tv in the joint has the Sabres game on.  I am not a hockey fan and ask Adam if he can change one of the tv's to the Boston Celtics game.  He looks at me like I am crazy.   Evidently, the owner requires all of her tv's to be tuned to the Sabres game when they are playing. Back to wings... I am again offered a Cajun wing and to shut the guy up, I finally accept.  Okay, I have since been to Elmo's 20 or so times in the ensuing 8 years.  I have yet to order anything but the Cajuns. They are hands down, the BEST wings I have ever eaten.  Not to knock the hots, but let me repeat, the Cajuns are the best. It would be nice to see the owner update or even move the place but maybe that's part of the Personality of the place. Although, the bathroom could very well be the nastiest bathroom I have been in.   I moved south 2 years ago and haven't been back up Buffalo way since.  sure do miss Elmo's. After reading some of the reviews on Yelp, I might even try the honey mustard wings if i get back there again. Please give Elmo's a visit if you are looking for THE best wings in Buffalo. Enjoy!
This hurts to write but tonight Elmo's failed me in all 3 phases tonight: Food - Wings under cooked.  Hard time eating them, weird coming from me because I love this place. Drink - Tasted like metal. Service - I really don't expect allot but it would be nice to be acknowledged when the food is dropped off. Put all these together and ot makes for a bad night.   So bad I'm starting the search for a new wing place.
This is a great place for wings! The Cajun ones were my favorite and the fries were crispy and good! The service was quick and the prices are reasonable. Give this place a try to give other wing places a run for their money!
I dare say, some of the best wings in Buffalo (which means in the country too). Duffs used to be my top choice for Wings but I think Elmos is stealing me away. I typically get the wings to go and eat at home, and it's always been an easy process. If you get there early you can just kill time at the bar until they bring the wings out to you. If you like wings, try these!
Best wings in the area. They definitely have kept up the tradition since the old Rooties left. Now that I'm back home, I will be frequenting mybold favorite spot again
Went here as a second choice for wings due to the reviews because Duff's had a 45 minute wait (good for them, not me at the time). When I'm eating wings, I don't really care too much about decor. A dark and dated restaurant really doesn't throw me off of the the main focus of the bar food. The dark was good, though, for watching the hockey games that were on two different televisions. Very limited selection of beer, but I did find an old standard (Sam's) that went well. Disappointing soft drinks for kid choices (not even fountain root beer), which put a bit of a damper on the kids' wing experience. The wings were on the tough side and pretty dry. Not too much help with gauging the sauce from the waitress--I like hot sauces, but  would rather not have forget-tasting-for-the-rest-of-the-evening hot. The sauce (medium and mild) was tasty, but common "red-hot" flavor, and the medium wasn't enough heat for me. Ordered a pretty good, but extremely greasy patty melt to accompany. Very good fries. Overall a "Meh." I can see how UB students would find some nostalgia in this restaurant, but for the occasional visitor or tourist, time and money are better spent elsewhere.
Okay, the place is a dive in an outdated strip mall; something my bride and I would call a "Hole in the Wall."  It needs a deep cleaning and some paint; and service could be a little better, but the food is terrific!  It's sports bar fare, so don't get too excited about thinking you'll find something out of the ordinary here. The Reuben was great!  My son raved about his French Dip, and my ex's (wife and outlaws) raved about their food as well.  No lemonade, but I won't hold that against them.  The bartender appeared to be the only person working at 1pm on a Saturday afternoon, and with one other party in there besides us, the service was a little slow in getting the orders out. The walls are adorned with Sabres jersies and the bar is rustic and woody.  A TV or three are located in the bar area. The carpets need a deep steam cleaning and the tables are easily seen to be dated by the condition they're in.  Bathrooms reek of urine, with rust everywhere and in need of a fresh paint job, but don't let that hold you back from trying the place out.  Just know your surroundings and expectations before you walk in.  As my bride and I have found out, we usually get some of our best food in the divey places.
After a brief stint in "the restaurant biz" (aka working the fry station at a local establishment over my summer break in college), I thought I knew most things about your standard issue pub grub. Chicken wings, for example, had just two variables: the skin and the sauce. Frank's plus butter equaled mild, Frank's plus butter plus Tabasco equaled medium, Frank's plus butter plus more Tabasco equaled hot, and Frank's plus butter plus a lot of Tabasco PLUS crushed red pepper and/or ground habanero equaled suicidal, atomic, ass-kickin, titty twistin' or whatever you wanted to call your hottest wing. Cook the wings correctly, at the right temp, and perfect your sauce, and you would have a great wing, I surmised... ...and then I tasted the wings at Elmo's and realized I was a complete idiot. It was at that point that I realized a third variable, flavor and texture of the meat underneath the skin, was just as important as the other two. But Chris, you might ask, how can you enhance the flesh of the wing if it's completely covered by skin? BRINE. I couldn't believe a restaurant would actually go through the effort of brining their wings, but knowing that Thomas Keller brined his fried chicken at Ad Hoc, the idea of brining wings seemed worthwhile, be it a little over the top for pub grub. I'm not going to try to describe the wings at Elmo's, but I just need to say that there would be no debate about whether Duff's or Anchor Bar had the best wings if Elmo's was closer to Buffalo proper. Elmo's would win. Handsdown. In addition to brining, the honey mustard wings are GRILLED, after being fried, to add some char and additional flavor. I wish my mother cared for me as much as Elmo's cares about its wings. Elmo's buffalo sauce isn't overly vinegarry (pay attention Duff's) and as a result of brining, the skin gets crispier and the meat stays moister than when you just throw a normal chicken wing into a fryer. Get a combo with a pitcher of Killian's Irish Red and get ready for most likely the best wings in the country.
Fallow up to first review .Went a second time and had quite a different experience . service sucked our waitress was more interested in toking on her e-cig in the corner than asking us if we needed more drinks due to our wings taking a while to come out . and on top of that they were cold and not cooked like the first visit . we brought the kids and they weren't impressed either. To make matters worse the price went up $$2.00 an order . which you cant tell from the menu . no $ for wings ??. Dot plan on a return trip. not worth it at all . Very Sad , no consistency   this was first time . Pricey but worth it. Good service.  And great wings.
One of the most traumatic things about coming to Buffalo for school was finding out people ate deep fried chicken wings. When I found out they dip them in bleu cheese I was ready to pack my bags and move back to NYC. A few semesters in the dorms, few drunken nights and lots of attempts to choke down a wing resulted in nothing but disappointment and a strong conviction that Buffalo was no place for a girl like me. I missed sushi, salads and good pizza. Then, one day me and some of my equally snotty friends decided to venture into Ruff Buff to try the wings at the Anchor Bar. I was in heaven. Buffalo was going to be ok after all. For years I ate nothing but wings from the Anchor Bar (Duffs sucks). That is until my first week of grad school. My advisor promised us the best wings ever to start the next few years of hell on a good note. I was all like 'That's great, I love the Anchor Bar'! And he was like 'Anchor Bar is garbage. We're going to Elmo's'. 'How was I going to study under this man? What have I gotten myself into?' I thought. Oh. My. G-d. This was my first lesson, teaching me that Dr. K. was always right even when I didn't like it or agree with him at first. Best wings ever. Hands down, no contest, no arguments. I never ate a wing at the Anchor Bar or anywhere else ever again. Their wings are brined, deep fried, sauced and then grilled. It's a transcendent experience in wing form. Cajun and Honey Mustard (yes, it sounds gross. It's not) are magnificent. There are no words to describe them. They also have (had?) a deal where you can get a double order of wings and pitcher of beer, (I recommend Killian's with their wings) for something ridiculous like $14. Skip Duff's, skip the Anchor Bar and any other place 'those' people tell you to go and come here instead.
A little known bar off Millersport Highway is home to the BEST WINGS IN BUFFALO!!! Forget the hoo-hah about the restaurant's history or decor, the wings are the main attraction at this local hometown bar. 10 Buffalo Wings - Medium:  When first receiving the wings, the first appeal observed was the texture of the chicken.  Unlike most other Buffalo notables, Elmo's rendition of the Buffalo Wing appeared to have a slightly charred exterior.  When penetrated, the exterior revealed an abundance of luscious / juicy chicken wing meat.  During consumption patrons will find that the flavors of both the Buffalo Wing Sauce and the juiciness of the chicken to be invigorating.  The bold and brash flavors derived from the vinegar and hot sauce help to stimulate both the slight charred exterior and tender white meat.  With each bite, patrons will find that various brash flavors and textural contrasts work in conjunction to create a welcoming rendition of a Buffalo staple! 10 Buffalo Wings - Cajun:  Although the Cajun seasoning flavor was slight, the mild hints of spice detected on the wing made it a welcoming contrast from that of the burdensome corpulence of the Medium Sauce.  Unlike the Medium Sauce drenched wings, the Cajun flavored wings were seasoned.  What's emphasized with this rendition of the wing is the balance between the milt hints of Cajun seasoning and the juiciness of the chicken.  Both worked in conjunction to create an excellent balance. 10 Buffalo Wings - Honey Mustard:  By far the best wing flavor ever consumed!  Elmo's rendition of the Honey Mustard win is executed to perfection.  Heavy detections of sweet and savory are observed during the wing's tasting.  The delicate but bold Honey Mustard sauce produced heavy and abundant flavors ranging from the sweetness derived from the honey and spice derived from the mustard.  What's further impressive about the sauce is the ability to balance both flavors, which worked to perfection in encompassing the various components of the chicken.  Each additional bite revealed to consumers the perfect balance between the flavors with almost no distortion in both taste and texture. It's true.  Sometimes the little known establishments make the best of a city's staple.   Despite the notoriety rendered to other established Buffalo Wing restaurants, Elmo's holds true to it's roots by providing an excellent edible.
If you haven't got the point after reading all the other reviews, you're clearly not paying attention.  BEST WINGS IN BUFFALO.  Forget Duff's or Anchor Bar.  The secret is out that Elmo's is the place to go - take it from Buffalonians and out of towners alike. Quite frankly, this place looks creepy from the outside.  But do not be deterred! The fact that it still looks a little dark and ominous inside also says nothing about all the other charms of this place! The servers are reminiscent of the old diner waitresses seen on old television shows (usually - there are a couple younger ones as well).  They are fun, friendly, casual and aren't afraid to share a laugh (or a beer!) with you. This is a great place to watch a sports game with the "townies" of Amherst.  Everyone crowds around the various televisions in the small interior and a sense of community is instantly formed! The food is great  - typical bar food, sandwiches wraps, but who cares ... we're here to talk about chicken wings ... We are talking BIG meaty wings that don't lose their crispiness just because they are large! The sauce is perfectly spicy and doesn't run off the wing.  Order a split order with half regular and half Cajun - the Cajun is charbroiled to perfection with amazing flavor.
I would have never noticed this place before I was taken there. My boyfriend took me here as our first date (classy guy...) but it was a great experience. I've never left upset.  Everytime I go I get the chicken quesadilla. I do like the wings and the wraps too. I've gotten the quesdilla so much that I often get cravings for them. The wait staff and bartenders are very nice too. All in all, it is a great place to eat and drink!
As a Buffalonian I consider myself to be a chicken wing snob. I have travel to many places the world over and always defended Buffalo as the best place on Earth to get chicken wings. Any place that referred to them as "buffalo wings" did not get my business. Like I said, if I am white collar anything, it is a white collar chicken wing eater, although I am usually in cut off t-shirts. Nevertheless, I am quite the hard to please customer when it comes to wings, but Elmo's always, always leaves my stomach full, my thirst quenched, my fingers greasy, and extra bleu cheese for the next  guy. I LOVE the chicken wings here. I have gone as far as arguing on an airplane with a lady who was trying to send a family to the Anchor Bar for lunch, telling them this place has the best chicken wings in the city. I begged to differ, and made sure she and the family who was receiving bad advice, knew so. I told them all in a mildly eccentric manner that while the atmosphere of Elmo's may be nothing special, the food turns it into a mecca, and please someone tell me how many places serve Sam Light in the bottle as a regular priced beer? The dim lighting, the sticky floors, the old school raised and notched bar top serving platters, the out of date jute box, the cold beer and the best chicken wings in Buffalo...go to Elmo's, eat, drink and be merry. And tell Nancy the waitress Mike Shurmatz sent you.
Being born and raised in Buffalo I feel as if I have this god given right to voice my opinion pertaining to chicken wings... not these so called "Buffalo Wings" people speak of! haha I've had my fair share of trying wings all over Buffalo (Duff's, Anchor Bar, Santora's, Frog Hair, and various dive bars in the city), but hands down Elmos beats them all. Forget about the battle between Duff's and Anchor Bar, this place is hands down the best. You may drive by this place on a daily basis and not even know it exists. Its tucked away in a quiet strip plaza (getzville plaza) on Millersport Hwy and is packing a punch when it comes to their wings. Although they are a tad bit overpriced (well... what isn't these days) their cajun wings are well worth it. A mixture of spices and sauces combined with the grill for a nice char makes for heaven in a bite. My second favorite would have to be their honey mustard sauce which is tangy and sweet all at the same time! Besides the wings their other menu items are pretty good. Their horseshoe bar allows for an experience having late night drinks. The service is always friendly and they don't forget a face! I hope that next time you are in Buffalo or the Williamsville/Getzville area you stop in for some good eats!
I'm a wing purist and typically stick to the traditional Buffalo style sauces with as much vinegar as I can handle. Elmo's might have changed my mind though. Although not much of a place to look at, they serve one of the best wings I've ever had. The Cajun wings they serve up are phenomenal in every way. Fried and grilled with plenty of Cajun seasoning, the wings explode with dark grilled flavors and the salty, slightly spicy rub. After eating these, it is going to be hard to not compare every wing I have to them.
Located in the middle of a strip mall plaza the same type that you drive by every block  in the suburbs. So you might not even be paying any attention or know that you just drove by one of the best places in all of Buffalo to get some AMAZING Chicken Wings! Inside there is nothing special or fancy, just a bar a few tables and a couple of TVs located around the restaurant. Their jukebox hasn't been updated in years but during a sports game that doesn't matter. The service here has always been friendly and above par for what you would expect. Kudos to that! Service can make or break a place. Now down to the meat and bones of this review! Their WINGS!!! My two favorite wings from this place have to be their Medium Crispy and their Cajun wings. For their Cajun wings they charcoal grilled and use a seasoned sauce to make them irresistible!
A little after I wrote my first review (take a look), I went up to Buffalo for the weekend. And put Elmo's on my to-do list. I went around 6pm or so and surprisingly did not have to wait at all for 3 ppl (its usually pretty packed). We ordered a pitcher and had like 5 lbs of wings in 3 flavors: hot buffalo, honey mustard, and bbq. And during the meal I had to rethink how I rated Buffalo Wings. When it comes to honey mustard, Elmo's takes it hands down. We already know that. But their regular Buffalo Wings! Mm mm mmmmm! Its crispy, its meaty and moist-y, its saucey (but not drowning in sauce), and best off its tasty. Elmo's has Duff's beaten...next time I'll give Anchor Bar another try to complete this review
Wings were delicious ! Nancy was very nice as well. Definitely will visit again.
When you are near Buffalo, how do you not get buffalo wings? I got the "fingers and fries" and my husband got the hot wings. One star off for slow service.
Typical bar food. Good wings. I would return. It's a good place for a quick meal and a beer.
I was disappointed with Elmo's and I love wings!!  The service was horrible.  took forever to get drinks and place our order.  Then it took about an hour to get our wings.  We watched the table next to us sit down, eat, leave and another group sit, get drinks, and order before we even received our wings.  We couldn't even get the waitress to get more drinks.  The wings themselves were nothing special.  They were mushy and did not have much flavor, and the blue cheese was not blue cheese.  I think they gave us ranch.  I will be back to Buffalo and I will still eat wings, but just not at Elmo's.
Growing up in the North towns most of my life and going to UB North for some classes, I'm somewhat surprised I missed out on this wing mecca.  I only recently discovered it...thanks to some fellow Yelpers!   Decided to order out a double order of wings (2 1/2 pounds listed on the menu), half the famous Cajun and the other half the Honey Mustard.  Asked for extra crispy!  The place is in a small plaza on a busy road and I can see how it might get overlooked.  The small restaurant is somewhat dark inside with a decent size bar.  I went on Columbus Day late in the afternoon and it probably had about 4-5 people drinking at the bar discussing the weekend and commenting on the sports highlights up on the TVs. After getting the wings and smelling the flavors in the car I couldn't get home fast enough....surprised I didn't get a speeding ticket!  Got home and I dove into the Cajun wings and Wow they're damn good!  Not too hot and bursting with a perfect Cajun rub flavor.  And dipped into the blue cheese just added to the overall wing awesomeness!  The honey mustard wings were sauced sweet but not too much, the slightly salty chicken wing flavor underneath added a good balance....Excellent too!  I originally intended on saving half the double order for the next day, but downed more than half the double order before I realized it...ahh oh well!
Anchor Bar? It relies on its legacy. Duffs? Please, their fries are better than their wings. If you're in Buffalo and want the best wings of your life, go to Elmo's. During college, my pals and I used to go here once a month. It would've been a weekly trip but our college-student pockets were as deep as a haiku written by Miley Cyrus. I started to go more often when I became of legal age, and it was there that I was introduced to one of history's most unbreakable duets; wings and beer. I can still taste the honey-dijon wings and Killians in my mouth. You can't go wrong with any of their flavor varieties; I always went with cajun and honey-dijon.
We ate there last week during a x-country trip because a friend gave us the recommendation.  We ordered a 20 piece plate of wings split between hot buffalo style and Cajun.  The buffalo wings were great, but the Cajun were FANTASTIC!!  I would highly recommend this place and their Cajun wings.  The Labbat's was also cold and delicious.
So...  I think the chicken here is better than Duffs or anywhere else, but I really like the variety of sauces at BWW.  The interior is like a time machine... going back to... ghetto.  I typically get my chicken dry with the sauce on the side... I'm thinking it may be worthwhile to order just the chicken and use my wife's Korean style marinade at home.
If you're visiting Buffalo in search of its namesake wings .. look no further than Elmo's.  If only I knew about their amazing honey mustard wings sooner, I would've spared my parents from the dry, flavorless wings at Anchor Bar when they came to help me move into my dorm.  Don't make the same mistake I did.  The only thing they tell people about Buffalo is that "there's a lot of snow."
Fly into town late on a snowy night and nothing, I mean nothing is open.  Using our favorite "go to app" Yelp, we find Elmo's.  The Holy Grail of wings.  Did I say the wings were awesome??  I guarantee, repeat GUARANTEE, these are the best wings in Buffalo.  As a matter of fact I've never had better wings anywhere on the planet.   All I can say is, "I'm not sayin', just sayin' " these wings will blow you away!
Went there for lunch, and it was an epic fail.  Everything that could go wrong did.   1.  The exhaust fan broke and smoke billowed into the building to the point it was hard to breathe.  Our server brings out a crusty old fan to blow the smoke away from our table, towards the regulars sitting at the bar. 2.  The drink selection was more than lacking, unless your looking for a blue light.  They were out of most specialty beers, some of which my group were looking forward to. 3.  The food was not good.  I purchased a Ruben and the meat looked horrendous. It tasted and looked like a dog's chew toy.  BLAH.  I picked it off and ate a sauerkraut sandwich on rye.  Most of the other guest's food was left on their plates, and was not worth eating.   4.  Service was OK, even though she did not remember who ordered what.  She tried to comp us drinks, but only two people actually didn't order water.  Meaning, if you ordered a pop then today was your lucky day. Right now I'm sitting at my desk waiting for my lungs to open up.  Sorry to say this place has been removed from the acceptable places to eat lunch...
The ideal neighborhood bar... Great juke box, AMAZING wings, great staff, BEST bloody mary's in buffalo. The hot and the Cajun are my 2 favorites. The beer and liquor selection leaves a bit to be desired but their bartender Adam does an amazing job with what he's got and to this day; I believe he makes the best white Russians AND bloody mary's. I used to come with my folks for dinner. Then with my high school friends for dinner. Now with my college friends for dinner and drinks. Crowd is always super friendly and inviting.  Dart board and jukebox provide endless entertainment... As do the staff.
Pluses: This place is just great. Today was my first time going there with one of my friends. I won a gift Certificate from during the Big Brother Big Sister  "Bowl For Kids" event. One of the girls told me that I should definitely check it out, because they have great wings and she did not lie. They have amazing wings, and off course had to get fries and it was also on point. Was not too greasy, the wings weren't either and that is why I love it. Minuses: We went after happy hour, and it was a big game night so it was pretty packed "Miami Vs. LA" basketball game since its the playoffs. Service was okay, we had to wait for a pretty long time to get our order taken. Then after that awhile to get our food, and the waitress wasn't so friendly and talkative with. I don't  know maybe because she had a long day, or whatever it was she had no smile on her face. Also after we ate we waited awhile to get cashed out. I ordered a lemon martini with vodka, and got straight vodka with cherry inside which was very strong. I just drank it, because there was no waiter around  when you needed them, its like they come and deliver your food and disappear. They come and take empty plates and disappear, I don't know maybe my friend and I came at a wrong time because I heard pretty good stuff about this place, but did not feel like I got that experience. So I plan to go again, maybe it will be better second time around and off course earlier in the day.
My high-school BF's mama used to work here, slinging wings and serving beer to crusty old guys in tractor caps who came in to watch the game. We'd drive all the way out from Tonawanda, just for to hang with the fun, salty waitresses and mow down on their souvlaki. It's seriously the best in the city, and that's saying a lot.
typical bar atmosphere - wings were great! Nachos insane and loved every bite - very nice waitress too.
The place is a dump, the service is pitiful, the wait for food is outrageously long, but the wings and wraps are awesome.
Went for lunch as we were on the neighborhood during a business trip.  The wings were great, better than any I've ever had but I've never had any in Buffalo so can't compare to Duff's or Anchor Bar.  Had the French Dip and it was really great too, great crusty bread.  The fries weren't worth the calories.  The service was really bad.  Not a big lunch crowd but only 1 guy working.  And this place is dirty.  Sticky floors, filthy bathroom.  Probably won't be back.
I would like to have made comments on the food and service, but for the second time no one greeted us when we entered.  We tried to wait for someone to seat our party of three, both times we waited.  The place was not busy, maybe two or three tables.  Needless, we left without being seated.
BEST WINGS IN BUFFALO!!!!!!!!!!!!! You gotta try the Cajun wings!! Charcoal grilled and then a light seasoned sauce, it was a lifechanger. Its not a huge place, its nothing super fancy, its tables, chairs and a bar.....But in Buffalo its about the wings, and this place is better than Anchor Bar and Duffs.....Yeah, I said it!!!
I like Duff's better. Elmo has a wider variety of wings. But their standard buffalo wings were a bit dry and doesn't have enough sauce.
The first time I was in Buffalo was last year and I made sure to eat at Anchor bar, which turned out to be overrated in my opinion. Duffs is alright. But Elmo's...Elmo's definitely my favorite wings place in Buffalo. Just to think about their cajun and hot wings make me salivate, and I'm not even crazy about chicken wings. The most recent vist was with my significant other visiting from CA and we truly enjoyed our time there. The atmosphere was so chill and the service was great! The only downfall is they don't have microbrews. But if that doesn't bother you anyhow, please try this place out!
Go at night- this is a bar (I didn't know that). The first time I attempted to visit, it was on a Sunday afternoon and the place was closed... found out later that it was a bar. Their wings are DELICIOUS! None of that sad-skinny-fried-wings business. Honey mustard is the best, my second favorite is their BBQ.
Wings were very good, but the other food was very average.  The server didn't seem to be excited to at work that day.
Best.Wings.Ever
This is one of my favorite place for wings. Absolutely love it.
I moved from Buffalo over 15 years ago and unfortunately only get back home once a year.  With all of the fantastic eats around town, I have my work cut out for me when I try to fit it all in to a week long visit...I'll tell you that 5 straight days of lunch and dinners at my favorite greasy spoons is not as rewarding as you might think!  Elmo's is always number one on the list.  In fact, I almost always spend my first night back home with 2 of my closest friends... catching up over several beer/wing specials well into the night.  I also have an annual father/son golf tournament (usually the very next day) where the prize is nothing less than beer/wing specials on the losers!  Although it might be somewhat of  a cliché...."Buffalo Wings"...how good could a fried chicken wing be, right?!  Well my friends, you will never know the answer to that question if you have not had the absolute privilege of an Elmo's visit.  I can say with 100% assurance...if I had only one meal left to eat before my demise...it would be a beer/wing special...hot with blue cheese and celery!
