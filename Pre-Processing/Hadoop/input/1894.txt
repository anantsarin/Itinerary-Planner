Best Sunday brunch in Poughkeepsie! The food is spectacular and portions are great for a reasonable price. We go as often as possible with friends or family from out of town! Everything we have tried has been great and we will keep going back. I have never loved the selections on the dinner menu, but everything I've had there has been good.
The entrees here are a bit pricey for what they are. Granted, you get a decent portion size compared to other places charging 18-20 dollars for an entree, but I still would rather pay that much for something mind blowing, vs something similar to Applebee's in quality. Maybe I was just there on an off day. The sangria also had practically no alcohol, which was a total rip for 7 dollars. Don't know if I'll ever go back. I expected more than mediocre and over priced. It seemed like a lot of stuffy old people, so maybe I'm just not their target demographic.
Our favorite casual go to place.  I almost always order fish because the chef does it better than any other restaurant in our area. I am so surprised at the reviews saying it is pricey for $15-$25 for an entre that comes with a great salad. Pricey? Beer selection great, good desserts and great service.
Not understanding the poor reviews here. Place is up beat, happy, and casual. Your not going to the beech tree for a world class experience your going for lunch to have a salad with maybe grilled chicken. Get a grip. Menu is a bit pricey but hello food is expensive. I love the one review on here going on about a teaspoon are you for real why go out stay home and make your spouse miserable.  Keep up the good work beech tree I like a bar-room atmosphere!!
Doesn't disappoint. Changing menu makes going often fun. This place is small so go early or on a weekend you may wait. But that's ok. Just sit at the bar and enjoy a drink, glass of wine or beer. Tip: Check Vassar College schedule.   When parents are in town it can a really long wait but worth the wait.
Love love love this place! I've been here numerous times for both brunch and dinner and always have a fabulous meal. The brunch is absolutely out of this world and the best I've had in Poughkeepsie. For dinner, anything is good. Nice beer selection. Small place with a cozy atmosphere. I've brought several friends here and they always love it. My one critique is that the wait time for food can be a bit longer than some people may like, but it's worth the wait! Small kitchen with big flavors! A true local gem!
I loved this place when I lived in PK.  They have one of my favorite burgers in town.  They are big a always cooked just right and served on an English muffin.  I love anything served on an English muffin.  Then you have the $5 20 oz craft beers.  How can you beat that?  This place is not big, but has a great atmosphere.  If you're going for dinner on a weekend, I'd go early as you may have to wait for a table. Definitely check this place out.
I was invited as a guest with a friend who is leaving the area and had a gift certificate to this restaurant. We got there and were confused as to where to sit exactly but we sat down. We asked the waitress if we could use the coupon after we discovered it had expired in December. Instead of saying something like "Hmmm, let me check with my manager and see if there is something we could do" she just said "no, we can't take it". At least, try and see if something could be done just to see. We ordered the food which was a little high in price but I will say this about the food, it was excellent. No complaints at all, very well done, its just the service. We were never asked how everything was (one other waitress did ask us, not ours) and please, if you charge $2.50 for a glass of soda (and no refills to boot) tell us its more money for every one I order (very sneaky and these are NYC tactics being used here in Poughkeepsie?) No interaction from manager or owner (ask us, we like talking to managers to let you know what is being done wrong so it can help your business) Again, I have nothing bad to say about the food, just the bad service and the soda tactic made me decide NEVER to go there again or recommend it to anyone I know. In fact, it will be quite the opposite. And if you're going to be in food service, smile a bit, it helps instead of looking like you really do not want to be there. I think my friend said it best when she said "At least I'm moving and never have to come here again" Avoid this place unless you want the great food and nothing else.
I like the Beech a lot. I might even give it 5 stars because the food is great, the beers on tap are great, and it is jolly little joint. BUT. And I say this because I've been there too many times and had the same experience...we live in Poughkeepsie. A place where it is notably chilly 6 months out of the year. Either the people who run the Beech think we are all polar bears, or their miserly behavior w/r/t heating is designed to deliver an unpleasant experience. We were just there again and seated by the window/door -- there is a radiator right underneath the window which doesn't work, and the management's response to that was to put a tiny ceramic oscillating bathroom heater on the window sill. Seriously? So yeah, go the Beech. But bring your parka and earmuffs!
After reading so many ravishing reviews, I decided to drive to this place ( I live in Monroe, NY), and give it a try.  Upon my arrival, parking was somewhat of a challenge.  Boy, am I am glad I decided to drive around until I found a parking spot.  This small restaurant is very good!  The beer selection was superb and my dish was a true delight.  One happy customer here!!
Definitely one of if not the BEST restaurant in the area. Great steaks and shrimp in creamy pesto. Good calamari also. Just wish they had better seating. Not comfortable.
I have really fond memories of the Beech Tree from my Vassar days (it was the first time I ever had baked brie and it pretty much changed my life). So when I found myself in Poughkeepsie for dinner, I had to return. It's a little more pub-like than I remember, but their food was still good and their beer/wine menu was quite extensive (I was particularly impressed by the beer). I got the softshell crab and my wife got a Caesar salad.  On a Friday night, it definitely had a celebratory "It's the weekend!" vibe.   If you're a Vassar student, you just have to try it. And definitely get the baked brie appetizer for a mind-blowing cheese experience!
With it's tiny lights hanging around the door screams pretty and for some reason i like the name ,maybe because it reminds of sunny California.  We came here for dinner and the place had a very village like atmosphere.There were the brick walls with lights which were glass painted in it's usual color combination and design.Most of the crowd came there to drink as it was 10 PM and i was the only girl who was starving and ordered the Portabella sandwich.  As i sat there dreaming of a yummy sandwich and accompanied by friend who tried a Beer flight in which 2/3 where yucky!Soon my plate arrived with an over burnt portabella mushroom patty placed between an English muffin.  *Clink clank* my dreams of a yummy sandwich was crushed.As i tried to add some ketchup to the muffin and hoping i would not be able to taste the burnt mushroom,i failed constantly till i finished the sandwich.yeah !!i am a trooper!!! yipeee..   But the side of fries was great,well cooked and i hope they gave some spicy curry for a dip.   Well,this place didn't have many choices for vegetarian's,but i am sure it's a good place to hang out with friends and get a few drinks   .Located close next to Vassar school i am sure Beech tree grill's it up real good  :) -Smriti
My friends and I took a day trip out of NYC and after a long day of hiking at Lake Minnewaska and fruit picking, we found ourselves at Beech Tree Grill after being turned away at American Bounty at CIA (Our fault since we didn't make reservations before hand). We called ahead to see if there was a substantial wait for a group of 5 on a Saturday at 7PM and were pleasantly surprised when we were told that there was no wait. Upon entering, we were instantly drawn to the chalkboard that has a whole list of draft beer, all of which you can get as an imperial pint (20oz) for only $5. Beech Tree Grill, you already won my heart over. Rehydrating on beer! Win #1. (Note: The beer wasn't as not as cold as I would like my beer. I think its because they didn't pre-chill the glasses before pouring. But I'm not going to complain, because the quality/quantity for the price is amazing. I don't know if they rotate the beers here, but I had the Gaffel Klosch and Griffin Fuller ESB and tried the Two Brothers Black IPA and something else... all of which were good) On to the salad... Normally, I wouldn't comment on a side salad that comes complementary to a main. I mean, when has those type of salads even been amazing. But, I must proclaim how surprised I was by the caesar salad at Beech Tree Grill. You can tell that they make their caesar salad the traditional way, taking no shortcuts. You can actually taste the anchovy in the dressing! My friends commented that if they had known how good the caesar salad was, they would have ordered it instead of the house salads they got. Oh well, their loss, my gain. 5/5 stars For the mains, I decided to get the hanger steak ($18.50), mainly to compare to St. Anslem, where I've had the best hanger steak to date. I ordered medium rare and the steak came with mashed potatoes and a beet salad. I can say that I was pleased with the steak that I got. It was cooked well and tender. It was a bit over-charred on the ends. Though I would say that St. Anslem makes a better hanger steak that is seasoned and executed better, Beech Tree Grill did a good job with the steak at a good price point. 4/5 stars Things I tried from my friends: Duck Breast & Duck Leg Confit (Special): The confit was delicious and the breast was moist. 4/5 Stars Pulled Pork ($16.50): Good but not great pulled pork. Very saucy. The fries that come with are crispy and seasoned well. 3.5/5 stars. Soft Shell Crab ($11 Special): I've been craving this, so I don't know if I can objectively rate this. It made me happy though. 4/5 stars Lamb Chop (Special): A well-executed lamb chop. 4/5 By the end of dinner, I didn't want to get up from the table. Its been a long time since I've been so happily full. Honestly, I don't know if I am objectively reviewing Beech Tree Grill because of my distorted sense of pricing created by living in NYC and paying Manhattan prices for food. If this restaurant was in NYC, there would be a hour wait on the weekend. Lucky for us, we didn't have to wait for what turned out to be a great dinner that didn't break the bank. A place I would keep on going back to if I lived in Poughkeepsie. 4.5/5 stars
This place is small, dark, and cozy. In a good way. I've always gone when it's dark out and I'm color blind so all I know is the place is dark. If there are other colors there, I'm not aware of them. **The Location** Right on a busy corner with other food and drink establishments. You can actually attempt a very small bar crawl around here if you want. **The Space** Small Dark Cozy The bar merges into the restaurant. Not a lot of tables. Like others have said, a nice place for a date. It does, however, get really packed on the weekends. If you want a seat (bar or otherwise), get there early. **The Beer** This is in the top 3 restaurants in the area to experience beer. Their selection rotates so I won't attempt to even take a snapshot of what they have since it'll probably be gone by the time you get there. But one time they had a Cask Conditioned Hoptical Illusion. I like regular Hoptical and the cask conditioned was great. Never seen it before and don't expect ever to see it again. **The Food** Quite honestly, I was never that impressed with the regular menu they have. It's not bad, just nothing on there ever screamed out to me. I believe there's a shrimp pasta on there that I would say was the best regular menu item I've had. The specials though are generally very good. I hate to bring up specific specials, since they may never be served again, but they had a smoked chicken app that was cooked with roasted potatoes, sauteed onions, and some other vegetables and spices. It was one of the best things I've ever eaten. **Summary** Overall, it's a really nice place to have a pretty good meal and good beer. They have wine and a full bar too, but I've never had any so can't comment on that. The people at the bar are friendly (lot's of regulars, which is a good sign). It's more expensive than the surrounding places, but you really do get what you pay for here.
Beech Tree Grill tends to get overlooked by people (mostly Vassar students) because of its proximity to the ever popular Babycakes. However, it is a surprisingly nice place to have a meal, especially with parents. The interior is dark - dark wood everywhere, muted lighting - and the tables can be somewhat crowded together when its full. The staff is friendly and attentive but with a nice laid back feeling. The food is solidly good; their menu has a nice range of items to choose from, offering both lunch and dinner (and brunch on Sunday). Lunch consists of a few appetizers, salads and pastas, and sandwiches, while dinner switches the pastas for entrees. And of course there is dessert, and a wine and beer list. I've eaten there twice. Once was lunch, where I had a special Caesar Salad with Scallops that were perfectly seared. The other time I had their brunch, with a lovely mimosa accompanying my Crme Anglaise French Toast, which was delicious (although I much prefer Babycakes' breakfast offerings). Its a very good place right next to the college that people should really go to more often.
A gem like this is fairly rare in Poughkeepsie---cherish its greatness. Consistently good. Close to Vassar College. This place never veers from greatness. Amazing menu. Culinary chefs. Ever-changing beers-on-tap. Full bar. Great wine list. Good music.
Stopped for lunch on a Saturday.  We were the first people there around 12:15.  Started off with the calamari which was OK.  I had the brisket hash with yukon gold potatoes and a fried egg....absolutely delicious.  Bothe my wife and son had the turkey sadwich with triple-creme brie on an english muffin.  Rel turkey here...also quite good. Loved the atmosphere here as well.  Will definately go back next time we are in the arewa.
3.5* Went on an unusually busy Tuesday night. We were seated a bit slowly...but it was alright. Among the three of us, one had the pulled pork, one had the hangar steak, and I had the skate wing special. Pretty impressive menu. Portions are big, but a bit on the pricey side. My cod stuffed skate wing was pretty good--fish flavor was somewhat overpowered by the salt and butter, but not too bad. The basmati rice was a bit on the dry side, but the sauted root vegs tasted awesome. I did realize that after eating there though, I think they either use way too much salt, or they used MSG because I felt I just ate at a chinese restaurant without asking for no MSG (which I always do)--super thirsty. Anyway, overall, standard American fare. Nothing really that creative or special, but I think it's too expensive for what the food is.
I agree with a few of the reviews about this place as far as the size goes. But that also makes it all the more romantic, the cozy feel. Although on busy weekends it just feels crowded. The variety of wines and beer here are pretty awesome and change every time I've been there. While the food is pretty good, I always get their Hangar steak because I love it, so I can't speak much for anything else on the dinner menu.  I've tried a few of the appetizers which were good. All around probably a great place for an intimate week night date.
Went here for lunch on an early Saturday afternoon, recently.  The place was pretty quiet.  Overall, the bar was busier than the restaurant.  We sat at the bar for a few beers, and ended up taking a seat for lunch.  The bar tender was the one serving us our lunch dishes, as it was still too early for other wait staff to arrive for work (3:30pm).  Service was very friendly, prompt, polite and amiable.  That,  and the great beers on tap (at reasonable prices) was the best part of our first experience here.   Ambiance is rather cool......  relaxed, casual, cozy and warm. The bar is pretty much sticking right out in the middle (not literally) of the dining area, but its not too intrusive on the diners, or so it seems.    The area that we would rate the lowest part of our experience is the food itself.  This  is very unfortunate, being that this establishment is primarily in the business of selling food!   The Cesar salad that my husband ordered (with grilled chicken) was not reminiscent of having been prepared with the typical piquant Cesar dressing at all.  More like a mild ranch dressing was applied to the otherwise tasty, crisp greens.   My turkey-bacon-brie cheese sandwich on an English muffin had sounded very gourmet-ish in nature printed on the menu, but when it arrived, it appeared kind of mediocre and also ended up tasting as such, as well. The potato fry wedges were really nicely done, though.  Our appetizer, fried calamari, was rather tasty, but also a tad too heavy tasting with a heavy mayonnaise-based dipping sauce- too rich.   We liked The Beech Tree Grill well enough, though, to be willing to give it another shot for dinner.  Maybe with some friends, this time around!!
So here's the thing. The Beech Tree is a good restaurant, and I really like the baked brie with garlic. And the wine. But the beech tree has never in my mind lived up to the hype. The service is truly just not as good as people say it is (unless you actually know the waitress, which totally doesn't count), they are always crowded, and the menu is REALLY limited if you don't eat beef. I would say try the apps and the drinks, then go over to either the Dutch or Babycakes for dinner.
Since my first review I have been back to Beech Tree a bunch! I cannot get enough of the "Sautéed Wild American Shrimp, Roma Tomatoes & Fresh Mozzarella,tossed with Pesto Cream & Pasta" oh my, my oh my. My last visit I arrived too early for the dinner menu so the server set me up with a great salad until dinner started; to avoid a substitution with a lesser dish. It was worth the wait. I really enjoy this comfortable little place, many folks arrive at the same time every day, I hate to use a cliché like "Cheers" but you do see the same diverse bunch of professors, lawyers, used car salesmen, correction officers, utility company and social workers arrive, share a pint and commune over the day's activities; all on a first name basis with the servers. I was introduced to Beech Tree in the early 90's as they were known for   the most unique taps in town. Moved away from the area several times since but always return and am always happy with the food, service and atmosphere when I venture to Beech Tree. The consistent experience makes this place special, I don't want them to change a thing.
This is really a three and a half star review for an experience that happened a few years ago.  I'm bored and nostalgic right now. Old boyfriend and I came here for our two year anniversary.  For my entree I had "Grilled Hanger Steak, Mashed Potatoes, Vegetable du Jour & Jus" or whatever their menu equivalent a few years ago was.  It was a pretty good steak, and I know I was in love with the mashed potatoes (I'm a starchy kind of girl).  But that's not what I want to talk about. I want to talk about the appetizer we shared but I wish we had each gotten a plate of our own.  I'm talking about the "Double Crème Brie served with Roasted Garlic, Roasted Red Pepper Salsa & Toasted Baguette".  I remember when this plate came out and I was overwhelmed by the amount of warm melty brie in front of me.  With the roasted garlic and the salsa all on the baguette... it was total perfection.  Whenever I roast garlic, I think of this dish.  Seriously.  I realize it is a simple appetizer that dozens of thousands of places probably make, but I had it first here and it was divine. I'm craving it right now. Also I'm pretty sure we had an orange soda/vanilla ice cream "creamsicle" float for dessert but I'm not seeing it on the menu now.  Lame.... because I remember it being awesome.
My local favorite. You could even say I'm a regular. (yeah, I am) The chefs here are some of the best. The chef/owner Erin even smokes his own meats out back. You can NEVER beat the diner specials. I usually choose one of the special apps. The portion is good and it's a way to sample the finest food for a cheap price. (usually about $9) Scallops and crab cakes are always killer. Great beer selection and the staff is super cool and friendly.
A great little restaurant in the middle of Poughkeepsie near Vassar College. Gets very busy, but you can always loiter by the bar and sample the great beer range here. The food is always interesting - they often have appropriate beer recommendations for the daily specials - and you really can't eat better in the area. It's sometimes called pub food but you'd struggle to find this sort of food in any pub in England and anything close to the price. I return most occasions I'm in Poughkeepsie, and it never disappoints. Just round the corner you can play some pool at the Juliet Billiard cafe - get in quick before it's turned into a library by the landlords - Vassar College! (Seem to have lost my review from before)
Disclaimer: I'm a bit biased towards the Beech, because it's where my boyfriend and I had a great first date.  I'll try to be as objective as possible. It's cozy and welcoming, especially on a chilly night.  Tends to get crowded when Vassar is in session, so I've usually tried to head over during winter or summer breaks.  The food is tasty, the staff is friendly, and they seem to have a lot of repeat customers.  Stop in once, and you'll be hooked!
This little cozy place has quickly become our favorite restaurant on the Raymond Ave strip! The service is always excellent, the beers are unique and delicious, and the food almost always excellent. We're vegetarians, and even though there are not very many veggie options on the menu, we still keep going back because the meals are always great. Our favorites are the goat cheese salad (my hubby loves it with the salmon), soba noodle salad, and portobello sandwich. The baked brie appetizer is also incredible, though insanely rich and filling -- I usually only get that if I'm getting something lighter for dinner. The one time I ordered something from the specials menu it was decent, but we like our regular menu items better. I think what we love most about this place is the atmosphere. It's really comfortable, almost always hopping and lively, and the waitresses are super nice and accommodating. It's the kinda place we feel at home at, to the point where we go there when we know we shouldn't because there's plenty of food in the fridge... haha.
Definitely disappointing.  Coffee was excellent.  However, the frittata tasted like rubber - I swear they use egg beaters and not real eggs.  The menu said fruit salad and toast was served on the side.  My plate had an orange slice, a tiny slice of cantalope, and three red grapes - I kid you not.  The toast consisted of one small piece.  I asked for jam and got three packets of Smuckers (really?).  Beech Tree Grill should do a much better job than this.  I should have gone to Julie's.
Although my feelings on my first visit to this establishment have not changed, a recent visit was excellent and I am adding a star as a result. My wife and I both ordered specials (a NY strip for me, which I requested rare and was served VERY RARE) and I had the recommended beer. It was a fantastic evening and we will try this restaurant again to see they can consistently be better than their first bad impression.
arrived at vassar college for campus tour over an hour early so we headed over to beech tree grill for lunch;was apparently busier then usual because girl's soccer team from vassar had a big table eating there;my wife had bbq chicken sandwich on ciabatta bread,i had pulled pork on same,and my daugher had burger with cheddar on an english muffin. we all had salads to go along with same with vinagarette dressing;everything was very ample,tasty and very delicious,bbq sauces tasty and alluring without being too overpowering and ciabatta bread was very satisfying with a very smoOTH texture.all in all a true gem of a place with nice underrrated variety as well.
I first started going to the Beech Tree in 1995, when I got a job in Poughkeepsie. I've been to this restaurant on and off now for nearly 20 years and I can honestly say it doesn't disappoint. We went again last night, before a show at The Bardavon, and enjoyed another good quality meal at good prices. Yes, it's loud and yes the bar was packed with patrons waiting for tables...but isn't that good sign...a busy establishment? We skipped apps, knowing that a large, full salad with yummy balsamic dressing is served with all entrees (other dressings are offered but the balsamic is a great  choice). We enjoyed a flight of beers and a hard cider and entrees of hanger steak and pulled pork. Thoroughly enjoyable and brought quickly when the server knew we had a show to catch. Dinner with tax and tip was $60. This not one of Poughkeepsie's newest and trendiest spots. But I picked Beech Tree over all the other "hot" new places because I knew I could count on a well prepared meal with nice service and good prices.
Live in the neighborhood but haven't been in years because it is often too noisy.  Went for lunch last week, good atmosphere though coldish but only one other table so quiet.   We shared an appetizer of calamari which was pretty good.  However, our Caesar salad with chicken was an embarrassment.  There were cut up bottom pieces of the romaine...with absolutely no dark green tops, some parmesan cheese, not at all fresh, and a dried two pieces of chicken.  We couldn't believe the chef would let the salad come out of the kitchen so badly.  Even the dressing was not very good.
This little bistro has been a neighborhood staple for as long as I've lived in the area.  My husband and I go there once a season or so and every time we go we had not been disappointed. The restaurant's strong suits are its consistency and seasonal menus and reasonable prices.  I always get the Asian Sesame Soba Noodle salad and it's always delicious. And then I get a seasonal appetizer to try something different and so far all has been very good. My husband always gets an entrée and he's always liked his food too.  Their portions are pretty large so usually the entree and the salad that comes with it are more than enough. The decor is low key neighborhood bistro with a sometimes boisterous bar.  You can tell they get regulars there.  They get packed for dinner service, even on a week night but we never had to make a reservation and we always get seated within 5 - 10 minutes.
I went here for dinner with a friend and had a good experience. The atmosphere was very nice, not to stuffy and not too drab. The bar was also very nice and had a good tap selection. The menu did not have a lot of selection- especially for vegetarians but what we did see looked good. We had the double cream brie with roasted garlic and salsa as recommended by another reviewer which was quite good. I had the caesar salad with grilled salmon which was fantastic. My friend had the orange-glazed chicken which she thought was just okay- tasted more like plain bbq sauce than an orange-glaze. For dessert we had the creme brulee which was also just okay- the flavor was there but it was warm on top and stone-cold on the bottom and the sugar on top was mushy and not as hard as it should be. The prices were reasonable, as was the service. Overall I would recommend.
Really????? It is a Thursday night. Granted some of the local college students are returning, but we were seated fairly promptly. We then waited a full one hour and twenty minutes for our entrees, with no attention to this from our server. when the food was plopped down in front of us, I was without a spoon for the broth in which my seafood was served. I had to ask another server for a spoon, and she brought sme a -----TEASPOON! I dont know if the dish tasted any good or not, since I already had a bitter taste from this kind of treatment. This area is blessed with many fine eating establishments, thanks in part to the presence of the renowned Culinary Institute of America, so I see no reason to return to a place where food is clumsily and ungraciously served. In point of fact, there is a better restaurant next door, so I will just walk a few more yards next time.
Adorable place and possibly downtown Poughkeepsie's center of town.  Blue Moon + brie plate = perfect. It helps that the company was awesome, too. Was nice to go somewhere late-night and have nice food and drinks instead of French fries, etc.
Beech Tree was a delightful little place near Vassar.  We went for dinner and had good service and a solid food but I'm not sure that there was anything special that would draw me back.  It wasn't bad, the food certainly was good but it just kind of seemed standard- all things that could be easily made at home.  Again, it wasn't bad but I find myself not being excited about going back for dinner. I did see pictures of the brunch food which looks really good.
Absolutely wonderful. I just went here for brunch for the 3rd time in a month. The atmosphere is great the staff is so helpful and personable and of course the food is absolutely FANTASTIC! Their eggs are some of the best I've had in a long time and you would expect to pay a lot more for what you get. I will continue going back again and again.
We went here after dinner to get a beer as it was listed as one of the bars in town.  It's a bar, but more like a bar/restaurant.  It was a bit weird to see a family of four eating dinner at a table behind us after 9 pm on a Saturday night.  Maybe it was just a fluke.  Anyway, it's kinda small and dimly lit inside with a really good selection of beers, both on-tap and bottled.  Not a party atmosphere, as in it's not packed with loud music, so it's a good spot to have a drink and some conversation.
Had dinner here again weekend before last. The Beech has been a favourite for a few years now and they have yet to let me down. On this trip my husband and I split a carpaccio appetizer, tangy with shallots and fresh parm. They make a very good caesar salad, true garlicky creamy dressing, not the vinegary stuff you often find in this area. One thing I've noticed is that they no longer have fresh shaved parm on their caesar, it looks to be shaken from a can now :( Dinner entrees were from the regular menu, but the Beech sports chef specials every night as well. I had the hangar steak over mashed potatoes, it had an excellent crust with med-rare middle - I wish I knew how to make it like that at home. Husband had the salmon (house filleted grilled atlantic salmon), we both tried the vegetable cous cous, neither of us loved it, it was okay - just not my thing, not that it was bad. They make an excellent margarita and I like that there's dessert wines on the menu as well. There isn't a huge selection of wines, but still a little something for everyone. Service is friendly and fairly quick - fridays and saturdays are typically crowded and they don't do reservations so be prepared to either stand awkwardly by the front door or search out another place on a busy weekend. If there's one thing I don't like about the Beech is that weird little entranceway where you stand with all eyes upon you while you wait for your table. The bar is almost always full of tweedy Vassar-types. Prepare to spend $100 for two from drinks to dessert, although the menu is versatile enough to go $50 either way from that.
It's too crowded at night, and there is never a bar stool to be found, so I go during the day. I love it. The food is delicious. Certainly not fancy, but it's very good American bistro food. The woman who works during the day treats me like a star so I sometimes sneak here after a haircut in the afternoon, get a martini and I am a happy happy girl!!!
I have been going to the Beech for years and it is always a solid experience.  Brie app is fabulous as is the calamari.  Sandwiches are good, salads yummy.  Great beer on tap and a nice wine list.  Very small and intimate atmosphere and can be quite busy/loud/crowded on a friday night.  This place can be chilly/drafty in the winter.
Used to eat here all the time when I lived in the area. Great pub food and craft beers!
Great location. Great beer selection. Great food. Great service. I had the pulled pork and it was excellent. Friends all enjoyed their meals as well. Even the fries are good! Can get crowded on nights and weekends, as it is kind of a small space, but go early or later and it's awesome.  Definitely recommend it!
While not the cheapest place on the block (especially for college students), Beech Tree Grill is certainly the classiest and yummiest place to go on a fancy date. They have a good selection of entrees and desserts. Not to mention, the bread is good too! I suggest the salmon which is cooked just the way you want it and comes with a delicious beginning salad.  I have never been dissapointed and I always ask my parents to take me here on parents weekend. No reservations though, so try and find a time when Beech Tree won't be overly busy.
My husband and I went for our first dinner w/o our newborn.  Everything was great.  We had the works ( apps, dinner, desert, drinks at the bar after.  Great service and great food.
One of my favorite Poughkeepsie "landmarks". Classic pub menu. Terrific staff. TV worthy bar scene. Think Cheers with really good food.
This is a favorite of my husband and I.  We go here at least once a week.  The food is always delicious, fresh and prepared well.  Laurie (the server/bartender) is such a sweetheart and always greets us with a smile.  The meals are very reasonably priced and for $5 for a 20oz, you can get a delicious draft beer.  The beer selection on tap is small but changes constantly and is always unique.  This place is an absolute gem!
This is a little gem located in the Vassar neighborhood. Tends to attract the tweedy academic set (young and old) with the occasional intellectual hipster (young and old) identified solely by choice in eyeglasses, hairstyle, and vintage jeans. Regardless of the clientele, the exposed red brick, dark wood, and hunter green walls has a nice ambiance. I've had dinner here three times and my sandwich or salad selection has been above average to very good. Beer selection is excellent, wine selection is OK. Beech Tree is a somewhat small space, so with a dozen or so highly verbal liberal arts types, the volume can get a high but it's still a cozy and warm atmosphere worthy of returning to frequently.
Was @ Beech Tree on Monday 4/25. Arrived around 7 to find the place fairly desserted which was a pleasant surprise.  We had our pick of tables. I ordered the spinach salad with chicken & my companion had the always terrific hamburger ( the best around). The beer menu, as always, was extensive. The staff is always eager to explain and offer samples.  Overall, another satisfying night @ the Beech Tree. We just don't get here enough.
Our favorite place for years. It seems especially on its game of late.
I love the Beech Tree. I've been there about 20 times and only had a bad experience once, but I blame my blabbermouth company on that. There are a few things I feel like people can complain about that I could understand: It can get noisy, it can get cramped, and if there's nothing available and you have to eat at a high-top you can get uncomfortable.   In viewing any and all other complaints, consider the source and chalk it up to the person wishing they had done something else with their life and are bitter that they've never opened a restaurant and feel like they could do a better job (not a chance in hell).  It would be either this, or a lack of gastronomical education, and perhaps they should stick to more familiar territory, like a Friday's or maybe a hipster vegan restaurant that ...is kind of obscure...you've probably never heard of it....
In town from Los Angeles.  Yelped this one and we were not disappointed.  Solid four stars for the food and service!
My fav place! Their specials are always better then the regular menu. Specials are unique and inventive. Had some of my best meals ever here.
Went there today and was looking forward to enjoying their special of Chipolte ribs and they were delivered so overcooked and burnt that the chef and waitress should have noticed and they didn't. They did not charge me for it but they definitely should have "known better".
Ack!!! I *hate* the Beech Tree. To be fair, it's not totally their fault, but it's enough their fault that I'm only giving them three stars. I mostly hate it because it's the only real restaurant within walking distance of work/home (Vassar College). The problem is, it's not actually a *real* restaurant. They only have a few tables, and it's always super crowded. More importantly, their menu is really limited. If you're a vegetarian, like me, you can only eat the freakin' portabello so many times. (Why does EVERYONE think that portabellos are the only vegetarian food on the planet?) The other vege option is the soba noodles, which taste like earthworms in sesame oil - um... not good. As a last resort, you could order the "Double Crème Brie served with Roasted Garlic, Roasted Red Pepper Salsa, & Toasted Baguette," which sounds good in theory, but is just a platter of melted, poor quality brie surrounded by soggy garlic. I'll probably be publicly executed for saying all this, since everyone seems to love the Beech Tree. But, I feel better getting this off my chest.
nice classy place to eat. good live music once in a while. good drinks.
One of my favorite places in my area. Chuck's a great chef, the menu's got some great stuff - DO NOT miss his fried calamari appetizer! They're perfectly prepared & the homemade aioli is incredible! Also, Chuck makes  the best creme brulet I've ever had! Only complaints I have are that the menu needs to be expanded a bit & the place gets crowded very fast on Fri & Sat nights. If they expanded, the place would become a platinum mine!
Love this joint.  American type food but done to perfection.  I'm a burger connoisseur of sorts and I must admit the burger they do here is easily in the top three burgers I've ever had the pleasure of tasting of all time.  I've probably sampled thousands and thousands of burgers so that is saying a lot.  Its a thick burger, quality beef cooked perfectly.  I get aged cheddar on it with some sautéed mushrooms, that's just my style, you can do whatever your little heart desires.  For fixins they do lettuce, tomato (its a good ripe tomato, not the cheap stuff)...and pickled cabbage.  That's right pickled cabbage, and its a really good choice for a fixin indeed.  On the side you get a pickle and some steak fries.  I don't know what the do to these fries but they are finger lickin good, crispy on the outside with spices, and melt in your mouth on the inside.  The kicker here is the bun.  Its and english muffin.  Don't knock it.  I did my first time and was proved el wrongo.  Its perfect actually, its a big juicy burger so you need a man's bun to hold that thing together.  And it just works.  We've tasted a bunch of stuff on their menu and its all fantastic.  The beer selection is great, and its reasonably priced for the size mug you get.
We waited a bit for the waitress to take our order of drinks and an appetizer. Knowing we weren't there for dinner might have sabotaged us. The Merlot tasted like Malbec and the glass wasn't clean. The prosecco looked like ginger ale....very dark and that glass wasn't clean as well. A glass of water with lemon arrived with out the lemon. The brie appetizer is served with a healthy portion of toasted bread. The roasted garlic was very cold. The general dining area smelled like Pine Sol.....not the best scent to greet one.
Had dinner while visiting the campus with my high schooler.  The service was a little slow and forgot about the appetizer (we weren't biiled for it, so it must have slipped her mind).  My spinach salad with salmon was good (the fish was cooked as ordered- medium), but my son's bbq pulled pork didn't have much of a taste.  His vegetables were tasty, though.  Beech Tree is convenient to the campus and most of the tables were taken by parents feeding their offspring.  There was a bit of a bar crowd at 7 on a Sunday.  I'd try it again, assuming I have some reason to return to Poughkeepsie.
The best all around place in the Hudson Valley. Great Angus burger and with so many micro brews on tap that change every week, you will always have something new to try. Service is always great and the bartender know their stuff.  I try to go here for brunch almost every Sunday. The whole menu is amazing but I love the beech tree Benedict. Traditional eggs Benedict with fresh mozzarella and tomato served on a English muffin. I can't recommend this place enough! Do yourself a favor and try the Beech Tree Grill and find out why so many people fall in love with it!
Love this place! Been here probably a hundred times. Most consistent place in the whole hudson valley hands down. Not once have I been disappointed. Their salad with house dressing and blue cheese for some reason is better than anywhere. Also recommend the hangar steak and the burger on an English muffin. Excellent craft beers and house wines as well!
I love this place. It is small and tight. But the food and the beer list are terrific. Love the Chimay and La Fin du Monde. Good stuff!! I just I lived closer.
Been there dozens and dozens of times.   Nice selection of craft beers including cask conditioned ale on tap.   Wine select is good but not as good as beer selection.   Salad is fresh and so is the crumbly blue cheese.    Food is generally very good although we have had times where it's not quite as good as usual.   Staff is friendly but for some reason they don't tell you their names .... kind of strange given that many people frequent this place.    Owner seems like he is a nice guy but other than a few customers, he doesn't say hello or smile as customers.
arrived at vassar college for campus tour over an hour early so we headed over to beech tree grill for lunch;was apparently busier then usual because girl's soccer team from vassar had a big table eating there;my wife had bbq chicken sandwich on ciabatta bread,i had pulled pork on same,and my daugher had burger with cheddar on an english muffin. we all had salads to go along with same with vinagarette dressing;everything was very ample,tasty and very delicious,bbq sauces tasty and alluring without being too overpowering and ciabatta bread was very satisfying with a very smoOTH texture.all in all a true gem of a place with nice underrrated variety as well.
Live in the neighborhood but haven't been in years because it is often too noisy.  Went for lunch last week, good atmosphere though coldish but only one other table so quiet.   We shared an appetizer of calamari which was pretty good.  However, our Caesar salad with chicken was an embarrassment.  There were cut up bottom pieces of the romaine...with absolutely no dark green tops, some parmesan cheese, not at all fresh, and a dried two pieces of chicken.  We couldn't believe the chef would let the salad come out of the kitchen so badly.  Even the dressing was not very good.
I went here for dinner with a friend and had a good experience. The atmosphere was very nice, not to stuffy and not too drab. The bar was also very nice and had a good tap selection. The menu did not have a lot of selection- especially for vegetarians but what we did see looked good. We had the double cream brie with roasted garlic and salsa as recommended by another reviewer which was quite good. I had the caesar salad with grilled salmon which was fantastic. My friend had the orange-glazed chicken which she thought was just okay- tasted more like plain bbq sauce than an orange-glaze. For dessert we had the creme brulee which was also just okay- the flavor was there but it was warm on top and stone-cold on the bottom and the sugar on top was mushy and not as hard as it should be. The prices were reasonable, as was the service. Overall I would recommend.
Adorable place and possibly downtown Poughkeepsie's center of town.  Blue Moon + brie plate = perfect. It helps that the company was awesome, too. Was nice to go somewhere late-night and have nice food and drinks instead of French fries, etc.
Absolutely wonderful. I just went here for brunch for the 3rd time in a month. The atmosphere is great the staff is so helpful and personable and of course the food is absolutely FANTASTIC! Their eggs are some of the best I've had in a long time and you would expect to pay a lot more for what you get. I will continue going back again and again.
Had dinner here again weekend before last. The Beech has been a favourite for a few years now and they have yet to let me down. On this trip my husband and I split a carpaccio appetizer, tangy with shallots and fresh parm. They make a very good caesar salad, true garlicky creamy dressing, not the vinegary stuff you often find in this area. One thing I've noticed is that they no longer have fresh shaved parm on their caesar, it looks to be shaken from a can now :( Dinner entrees were from the regular menu, but the Beech sports chef specials every night as well. I had the hangar steak over mashed potatoes, it had an excellent crust with med-rare middle - I wish I knew how to make it like that at home. Husband had the salmon (house filleted grilled atlantic salmon), we both tried the vegetable cous cous, neither of us loved it, it was okay - just not my thing, not that it was bad. They make an excellent margarita and I like that there's dessert wines on the menu as well. There isn't a huge selection of wines, but still a little something for everyone. Service is friendly and fairly quick - fridays and saturdays are typically crowded and they don't do reservations so be prepared to either stand awkwardly by the front door or search out another place on a busy weekend. If there's one thing I don't like about the Beech is that weird little entranceway where you stand with all eyes upon you while you wait for your table. The bar is almost always full of tweedy Vassar-types. Prepare to spend $100 for two from drinks to dessert, although the menu is versatile enough to go $50 either way from that.
I have been going to the Beech for years and it is always a solid experience.  Brie app is fabulous as is the calamari.  Sandwiches are good, salads yummy.  Great beer on tap and a nice wine list.  Very small and intimate atmosphere and can be quite busy/loud/crowded on a friday night.  This place can be chilly/drafty in the winter.
Great location. Great beer selection. Great food. Great service. I had the pulled pork and it was excellent. Friends all enjoyed their meals as well. Even the fries are good! Can get crowded on nights and weekends, as it is kind of a small space, but go early or later and it's awesome.  Definitely recommend it!
My husband and I went for our first dinner w/o our newborn.  Everything was great.  We had the works ( apps, dinner, desert, drinks at the bar after.  Great service and great food.
