I've seen the mop and bucket co a few different times. Before that I had only seen the improv shows at my college. Mopco is definitely a step up! If you're into improv/comedy and live in the capital region I'd check it out. They sort of rely on audience participation at times so be prepared for that. Don't worry though, they don't put audience members on the spot! All in all, it makes for an entertaining evening.
