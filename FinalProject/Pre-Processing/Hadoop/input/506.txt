Great place to shop. Kellie is an absolute joy of a lady, and she always has interesting fashions, shoes, and jewelry. She carries a line of jewelry that supports the Hope for Heather charity. The jewelry is hand made and very fashionable. Dresses you can't find anywhere else and lots of cute accessories. She has an excellent catalog support system so if you need shoes or a purse to match a dress she can order them for you and have them here within 3 days. It is right in the heart of Armory Square so go check it out!
