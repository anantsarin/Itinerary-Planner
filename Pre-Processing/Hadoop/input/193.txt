What a hidden gem!!!  The owner Kristen is amazing she specializes in metabolic resistance conditioning offering bootcamp classes as well as personal training.   Kristine is constantly furthering her knowledge by obtaining higher certifications in nutrition, fitness & personal training .   Ive had 2 other trainers thru a nation wide gym over the last year.  I saw few results and honestly they were the opposite of what I wanted!  So I google trainers and I  was so lucky to have come across Kristine.  The trainers from the national gym do not even come close to comparing.  I have worked one on one with Kristine also attending a few of her boot camp classes.  She also has devised a nutrition plan specific to me, my body and goals (now I gotta follow it lol)  I have seen more results in the 3/4 months I have lost  inches & body fat working at Karved with Kristine than in a year at the other place.   She truly cares about  her clients!!   She takes notes every session keeping a log of progress, problems, concerns , goals ext.   Any time I have a questions or concern she is on top of it !! She spends her own time doing research to make her she is giving 100% !!  I look forward to working out with her twice a week and if I can squeeze a bootcamp in I most definitely do it!   She is fun, friendly, encouraging the atmosphere at Karved is warm and welcoming. You can't beat her prices!!!  I couldn't be happier having her as a trainer!!! BONUS!! Your 1st bootcamp is free!!
Love this place. You get a variety of workouts. The instructor Kristine and the crew that shows up to regularly sweat are fun and motivating.
