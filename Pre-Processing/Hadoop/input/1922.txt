This location is probably my favorite one. Always clean and always stocked full of goodies! :) Should change their name to the holiday store since they sell items for every holiday/season!
Don't be baffled when you see the name of this store.  They don't sell christmas trees anywhere in the store, but they do sell discounted merchandise from off-brand named retailers.  If you're looking for a certain brand, you're not likely to find that brand, but comparable brands.  Although I myself have never bought anything when my family goes into this store, my mother always finds something that she says she doesn't find at the price she sees anywhere's else. The store is well kept-up and is rarely ever messy from incorrectly-placed items, the employees are diligently working to keep up the store's reputation.  I don't mind going in the store for a few items, but at the amount of the stuff/time my family always spends at this store, I'd rather be someplace else.  Even any of my two brothers(twins) would say, they'd say the same exact thing.
love this store   and the employees, great deals, lots of polish pottery, great customer service.......... i shop here  often
I've always been baffled by the name of this store...  It seems like they'd be at a disadvantage during the non-Holiday time of the year.  Who knows, it must work for them.  I've visited numerous locations thanks to my DW adoration for this store.  Most of the time I find this store to be full of cheap tchotchkes but I actually didn't mind going there during our latest visit because we were looking for gift bags and such for Christmas.  They had exactly what we were looking for plus a bunch more.  Oh, I'd be amiss if I didn't mention that they actually do live up to their name during the holidays.  They had a ton of Christmas stuff for sale!
Four stars for a great inventory, but two stars for a dismal checkout experience. It's fun to shop here, especially in December (Christmas, duh), and the inventory had all the halls decked, all the bells and whistles, cards, candles, and a truly awesome set of holiday decorations.  Even some items in the small but varied furniture collection caught my eye. Checkout, unfortunately, brought me back to a bit of reality. There were only 3 lines open on a very busy day.  A woman from the customer service desk was pulling people with only a few purchases over to her area, which helped but was quite inefficient compared to actually opening a 4th register.  My cashier was quite frustrated because of the shoddy packaging of some of the items the folks in front of me were purchasing. They were small ornaments, quite nice, but in many cases covered with cellophane wrapping INCLUDING the price tag. Many of them would not scan either on the glass or with the hand gun, and she had to open the packages, remove the tags to scan them, and then re-seal the items. In all other aspects, it's your typical Christmas Tree Shop.
It get busy on the weekends when most people are off from work, but a good time to go is on the weekdays during the mornings and early afternoons.  It your typical depressing discount store in the Hudson Valley . They do have some interesting  items in the store from time to time.
good prices! Cool stuff love it!
