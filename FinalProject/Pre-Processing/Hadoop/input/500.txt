h&m is probably my favorite store for basic clothes shopping. and it's pretty sweet that they expanded the mens department here at carousel recently. the old location was nice, but the new one is at least twice as big. there's a fairly solid selection of dress shirts, polos, basic tees, jeans, and long sleeve shirts, so it's usually my go-to place if i need something casual and dressy-ish. i'm a thin dude (so this may not apply to everyone) but everything always fits perfectly and they seem to always have my size. best of all, the styles are current and everything is affordable. thumbs-up, h&m. glad to have you in 'cuse.
The old location in the mall was closed several years ago. That space was two stories, but is now occupied by Forever 21. The new H & M is much smaller and carries clothes that are often several seasons old.
