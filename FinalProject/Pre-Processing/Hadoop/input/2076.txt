If there is one thing I love more than Indian food, that would be appetizers! And when I heard of this semi-new Indian joint that has master the art of Indian apps I was stoked! I could not wait to go. So we went! You walk in to this tiny lil' cozy place with a flat screen on the wall playing nothing but non-stop Bollywood music videos. Could you ask for anything better? Yes, you could ask your server to bring you Bhel Puri Chaat! This app is the best they offer. That and the Paneer Pakor. These are just so delish. The Paneer Pakora is a light, fluffy mozz stick but like 1000x better. I go here just for these. And that is exactly why we went there last night. My craving for the Bhel Puri. We get there and walk into a full house. Good for the business, nota so good for the customers. Everything took forever. We had to ask for menus, had to ask for our dirty dishes to be removed (actually, I had to place them in the servers hands just before he/she walked away), had to ask for the check... and when I say ask I mean we had to ask multiple people multiple times. We would ask if we could order, they would say yes and walk away. So we asked someone else... same thing. Kinda like Ground Hogs day. The food was good. We ordered the Lamb Tandoori, alil overcooked, actually well done and not very flavorful. We ordered the Navratan Korma, this veggie dish, it was okay. I have had better. Tandoori's on Sheridan does it the best. Our third dish was Paneer Mahkni. This was really good. We will def be taking a break from this place, that is as long as I can curb my cravings for Bhel Puri. The service was so slow it was painful. The way I would describe the Indian Joints in the area go like this: 1. Delhi Chaat is your down home, country style cooking. 2. Kabob & Curry is the most Americanized (but the cook is awesome and they serve the tastiest in my opinion). 3. Tandoori's is the classiest. (All the women get roses after dinner and you get a bowl of warm rose water to wash your hands) 4. Not sure where I would rank India Gate. But I like the atmosphere here the best. Maybe it is because I am a city girl and I love the mix of people that come into this place. It is hit or miss with the food though. Guess it depends on if you have the A team or the B team in the kitchen. My son likes India Gate the best... that is if we go on a Wednesday night for the buffet.
I go to Delhi Chaat to ONLY eat chaat and get some mango lassi because the taste is very close to the chaats I had growing up in Mumbai. Their samosas are hands down the best in Buffalo! I have had mixed experiences with their lunch/dinner menus - which means that it lacks consistency in taste and portions.
Simple place with good food. But the chaat items are better!

I was NOT impressed with this place in the slightest and I desperately wanted to be. Meh interior, entirely empty snack/dessert cases and at-first-quaint but eventually annoying Bollywood clips and music videos playing non-stop at an obtrusive volume. All of this could have totally been overlooked for good food but... The food was older than dirt. Dried out, congealed to the pans and clearly darkened from far too long on the buffet line. This was very disappointing, especially when the restaurant was full and they should have been rotating in fresh food. I was impressed they had more unusual and vegetarian dishes than the average buffet, but most of it was over spiced with one or two flavors, versus the complexity of seasonings I prefer. This is the only time ever I've gotten a stomach ache from eating Indian food (a cuisine I usually think of as a comfort food, even when very spicy). The chai, which comes free with the buffet at Star of India and cheaply at most other places, was over $3 for one measly cup and tasted awful, even when I added loads of sugar to try to mask the absurdly bitter taste. Perhaps this is a more authentic chai than I am accustomed to. I usually LOVE chai in its many forms and have had it lots of places, but it lacked the yummy notes of spices I am accustomed to and just seemed acridly searing to the tongue. If this were closer to my house I would try hard to work up the courage for a second shot, as I have gotten rave reviews about their food (especially from several vegetarians) but I was so nonplussed I wouldn't travel this distance for a second shot unless I had plans in the area. Then, I would probably try their non-buffet menu. I am only giving two stars because they had pleasant enough service and goat on the buffet (which I love).
My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this little gem yesterday while craving Indian food. After reading the reviews of neighboring Indian restaurants and the glowing reviews of this one--how could we resist? I'm so glad we didn't! It's a quaint little place with the most flavorful dishes! From the vegetable samosas & sauces to the Garlic Naan. I ordered the Chicken Curry and my boyfriend ordered the Palak Paneer. I had both (we shared). WOW. It was spicy without losing its flavor. There were things I tasted in their sauce that were unexpectedly pleasant and delicious. I would go here again in a heart beat. Thanks for the wonderful reviews. I hope this place sticks around because I plan on coming here again.
Stopped over here for a wonderful lunch buffet on a long road trip from Boston to SF. Not much I can say really other than the food was wonderful, affordable, and served by one of the nicest women ever. These are the little diamonds that I thank Yelp for letting us know about.
Stopped in because I saw them at Taste of Buffalo and really liked their food. The buffet does not disappoint! The hostess was great, and helpful when it came to deciding what to pick. Definitely will be back.
The food as ok. although it was little old.. it tasted stale. Not too much variety. The plain rice were very dry and stiff. it totally felt as if they were cooked atleast the dayp before and had been re-heated several times.. I would not go back to this restaurant again.
check out my photos - the papadam was so fresh i could see the oil on it sparkling as it was served to me. the rice was perfectly cooked. i ordered non-veg thali which included tandoori chicken drumstick, 2nd curry chicken dish, 2 veggie dishes, mint chutney, raita, and for dessert a very sweet and creamy rice pudding. rave review for this authentic indian restaurant. so delicious...
The food and the staff are great, but the owner is a real scumbag. I'm not going back, after an unpleasant conversation with him, but if you do, ask to speak with him and find out for yourself.
I feel very torn on what to rate this restaurant. One one hand, they have some items I love. On the other hand, they've had some stuff that wasn't very good. THE GOOD: The samosa chaat is maybe the most delicious thing that exists anywhere in Western New York. It's just a great dish. I discovered it at Delhi Chaat and have since ordered it in other cities. Delhi Chaat's samosa chaat is as good as anyone's. It's super flavorful - layers of strong flavors make the whole thing come together. Basically, it's vegetable samosas covered in a yogurt sauce, chickpea masala, spicy cilrantro sauce, sweet tamarind sauce, diced red onion and tomato and some spices. It looks like a mess and it tastes like heaven. Sweet, savory... spicy, cool... crunchy, saucy... a delicious cacophony of flavor. THE BAD: I've gotten vegetable/navarattan korma and malai kofta that have been decent here. I would say the entrees are average, really, most of the time. Nothing special, not bad, just adequate. Vegetable korma is a bit too oily, but flavor is still good. But one time, I brought a friend who does not really love Indian food and I recommended she get chicken tikka masala. That's always a popular dish and has a really nice flavor, but when she ordered it at Delhi Chaat, it was weird. It was very thick and a dark brownish red. Usually, chicken tikka masala is creamy, like soup, and a bright red. The flavor was equally off -- it didn't have the sweet tomato-ness or the rich creaminess tikka masala should have. It was actually very bad. And I felt really bad because I wanted this friend to discover how enjoyable Indian food can be, and the dish seriously missed the mark. In that same meal, my malai kofta tasted as well like it was missing some richness it was supposed to have and the color was much darker than is typical. Disappointing. Overall, the people who work there are friendly and I will continue coming back for the samosa chaat. And I will continue to order takeout. Dining in, I thought the service was a little slow and the atmosphere of the restaurant is slightly divey. But takeout is simple enough. On balance, I have to give it three stars because the samosa chaat is worth like 10 stars. If there was no samosa chaat, I'd probably order from Taste of India which isn't too far away.

Amazing Indian food here in Amherst. We ordered the following: 1.) samosa chaat 2.) chicken makhani (spicy) 3.) garlic naan The samosa chaat was ordered as an appetizer and boy did it set the conditions for the rest of the meal. The samosa chaat was flavorful with chutney and yogurt sauce. You could still taste the light crispiness of the samosa even with the sauces on top of it. The chicken makhani was prepared spicy at our request. It was a perfect blend of spice and flavor. The tandoor cooked chicken was deliciously tender. The garlic naan was perfect!

I ordered food online (through yelp) for here... got a confirmation right away telling me my food would be ready in 30 minutes, thought all was well, and was looking forward to getting a tasty indian meal. 20 minutes later I get a messages saying the food won't be ready for another hour, at least (grand total of over an hour and a half, at a minimum).  I don't care how good your food is, if you can't fill a take our order in a reasonable period of time you should say so up front (or not take take out orders).

My sister and I came here with a coupon from restaurant.com hungry and ready to feast. We first started out with the samosa chaat which was delicious!! It's no surprise that it was the 2012 Taste of Buffalo award. The pastry was perfectly flaky and the filling was scrumptious- it was a bit spicy for me but my sister thought it was the perfect. It was probably the best thing we had while we were there with the mango icecream with pistachio being a close second. For the entrees, we decided to stay with our norm and get the lamb tandoori and the chicken tiki masala. The chicken was perfectly seasoned and very tasty. The tandoori however, left a little to be desired...the sauce was too acidic/ tomato-y and just tasted like marinara sauce. But the lamb and potato was still very enjoying- we just didn't finish the sauce. We might just get two dishes of the tiki masala next time. They were unfortunately out of the mango lassi, but we'll definitely be back to try it!

Best Indian in town - but order off the menu, don't get the buffet. Their spice level is such that "hot" tends to be more "medium" at least to a displaced Texan. If you want REAL spice, ask for "Indian" spice levels. And you absolutely must order off their chaat menu. They do this very well. The samosa chaat is hands down my favorite. Beyond their food, their service is fast and the owners are very friendly. While you are eating, you can tell that all the other patrons are regulars. Go, eat, an enjoy the Bollywood that always plays on the screen!

There are chats that you have with the neighbours, and then there are CHAATS than you have with the NEIGHBOURS. And this is the latter. You may think that a Delhi Chaat is what happens when you run into Old Mrs. Masterson at the meat counter at Wegmans. You would be half right. Possibly even two-thirds right. But definitely not three-quarters right. For the only truly completely accurate answer to the question you never even remembered asking, is: Delhi Chaat has good Chaats. It should technically be called Buffalo Chaat, or perhaps Amherst Chaat, because, well, lets face it... it's not in Delhi. It's nowhere near Delhi. It's quite literally on the opposite side of the world to Delhi. And that includes New Delhi. However, we'll let it slide this one time. It's not my favourite Chaat in WNY (hello, Bombay Chaat in Rochester), and it's not my fave in the country (Pitt's India On Wheels... nod to you)... but it's a good one, and probably the best I've tried in the Buffalonianical area. So if you like Indian street food and don't want to end up scrubbing the floors of a Bollywood movie set for peanuts (literally, being paid in little tins of Planters), then get over here as fast as possible (drive like a Delhi Taxi Driver), and order a Samosa Chaat. Thank me later. Like, not tomorrow, but any day after that.

I love Indian food, it is my favorite. I've tried 6 places in the Buffalo area and this is tied for first place on my list. First got a taste for Delhi Chaat when I tasted the gobi manchurian at the Taste of Buffalo in 2012...fried cauliflower with delicious spicy spices. Since then I've been here a couple times and certainly plan to be back! My friend and I went a little overboard on that first visit and ended up in a major food comma! We had the naan sampler which gives you a full piece of 4 types of naan (regular, wheat, garlic and onion/cilantro....garlic was my favorite,) the gobi manchurian, mango lassi (SO GOOD, smooth and tasty), Jeera Aloo (potatoes, spices, garlic, ginger) and Eggplant Bhartha (smoked eggplant, onions, tomatoes and herbs.) The following year at the Taste I tried and samosa chaat...wow was that delicious! Had this again on my next visit. The samosa was nice and flaky, topped with chick peas, onion, yogurt, mint & tamarind chutney. A sweet and savory taste explosion. ;-) I've also had the Vegetable Pakora, and this was good too. The place was on the smaller side, comfy, although not the best interior the first two times I went, needed some work. I haven't been in again since the remodel, so I'm looking forward to my next visit to see the improvements that have been made to the interior since the food was so great. Give this place a try!

Dissapointment !!! Went here only bcz had an amazon local coupon as a gift from a friend ;it was a pretty weird experience !!! First of all they don't take orders unless u show them the coupon and they make calculations and permutations as in to what u can order, !!! Ya kinda odd:/ and weird thing is that the Indian lady there not sure whether she's the cook or manager comes out as the server is taking the order and actually bossing him what to do and how to take order ,,,!! It was an unprofessional behavior of her treating the server as if he was her servant ;felt really bad for that guy:( ...anyways ended up ordering goat curry was actually very nice .but the fish curry wasn't up t the mark,!! I' would not recommend this place , there are better places and moreover cos sometime s it's not only about it's about the food but the whole dining experience

I think the food is ok here when we've ordered from the menu. We've had mixed experiences with the lunch buffet. They don't put a lot of food out and they take time to refill the things that are low. Other than that the dishes here are more unique I would say than the other Indian lunch buffets, like they'll have corn curry or soy chunk dishes which I never see at other places. They don't have chai or soup though which I really like on the buffet.

I have been a regular to this place since they opened. Food: Food is good and I would say best Indian food  in Buffalo area.Samosa Chaat is the best and can match the best samosa chat you can get even in India.Goat Curry is awesome. Malai Kabob is phenomenal and best I have ever eaten  .Buffet is best value for money you can get( even though I am not big fan of Buffet ). Service: Service is great.If they are busy then it may get 3.5 star as compared to 5 but I always have had great experience. Overall I would rate it 4.5 5 star.( as they don't have best decor ) but I rate restaurant based on Food and Service.If they had best decor I would give them 5 star.

I only found out about this place after an Amazon Local deal. Went here with a friend for dinner around 7pm, immediately greeted by smiling faces. Our waitress was a sweet girl who was attentive and happily answered all our questions about menu items. To start, we ordered the samosa chaat which is one of the best tasting foods I've ever had. We ordered the chicken makhni and the shrimp makhni, both really enjoyed our meals. Rice pudding was OK for me although my friend enjoyed it more. I've gone back and taken the samosa chaat to go, and it was just as delicious as I remember it to be the first time. I have yet to try their buffet, I'm hoping I can go back for that soon! :)

I've gone back and taken the samosa chaat to go, and it was just as delicious as I remember it to be the first time. I have yet to try their buffet, I'm hoping I can go back for that soon! :)
First let me start with this, I eat a lot of Indian food and have been to at least 6-7 in the area. This one might be my new favorite everything was super good! service was great the girl was very friendly and funny!   I had the veggie korma and my fiancé had the chicken korma both super Good, great flavor!  We got medium spice which is still spicy but wasn't too much, but often medium at Indian restaurants is more like American spicy. We also got the veggie sampler and lentil soup also super delicious! Another huge bonus is for the quality the price is more reasonable than other Indian restaurants in the area. Not sure why a few people gave bad reviews the one guy below from CA seems like he went on an off day and Jody..... Maybe she went on an off day too but parts of her review kinda seem to me like she just is not that familiar with Indian food.....she complains about the kheer being watery which is normal, and often has very few nuts or raisins.  I also think it is a bit unfair to give such a harsh review without trying the place again....the menu is huge! In short don't listen to the nay sayers this place is awesome! Try it for yourself!
Just got the naan and somosas for take but it's outstanding. Cheap. 2 orders of samosas and a naan for 8$. Perfect dinner. Fast also and great service. Love little places like this

Some of the best Indian food in buffalo.  Fast and friendly service.  Make sure you try one of the assorted appetizers as well as the bread.  You can never go wrong with the chicken Tandoori.  Just remember that mild hot and hot is really hot

The second worst meal in half a century of dining.  Nothing was fresh-- nothing.  Okra (frozen) was deep fried in old oil, the taste of the oil permeated any possible spices.  The raita was a cream with chips of fried dough leftovers... Not a tomato, onion, cucumber in sight, rice was not basmati, no ghee in the neighborhood.   Channa masala consisted of chick peas, tomato paste and a hint of spice... No onions, no tomatoes.   I can go on but I have better things to do. Avoid this place and protect your senses.   Must say, on a positive note, service was delightful.

I love Indian food and so I am always on a quest to find a local restaurant to fulfill my frequent cravings.Sadly, this is NOT the place. It's small inside and middle of the road in the cleanliness department.  The staff is friendly.  And, the menu is quite complete and organized into sections containing lots of appetizers, chicken dishes, meat (mostly lamb) dishes, seafood dishes, and vegetarian dishes.   Two of us shared an order of Vegetable Samosas (pastry dough filled with potatoes and peas).  They were THE BEST samosas I've ever had!  HUGE, crisp, perfectly spiced..... and the accompanying chutneys balanced their flavors perfectly. The two entrees we chose were, unfortunately, not as good as I had hoped for.  Both tasted kind of....old.  Like they had been made quite a while ago and then reheated again and again.  The Chana Masala (garbanzo beans cooked in tomato, onion and garlic curry sauce) was overly spiced (we asked for it to be "medium" and it was hot, hot. HOT) and tasted slightly burnt.  And, the Aloo Gobi Adraki (cauliflower and potatoes cooked with onions, tomatoes, ginger, garlic, and spices) was a mushy stew with hardly a discernible distinction among the many veggies.  They were cooked down that much!  And everything had a slightly vinegary taste.  Was it on the verge of going bad?   The desert menu was particularly disappointing.... especially since this place has the word "sweets" in it's name.  Only six choices and they were out of the mango ice cream.  We decided to share an order of Khir (rice pudding with raisins and nuts) and were disappointed to find it to be very, very watery.... and not a single raisin was anywhere to be found.

A solid choice to introduce yourself to good indian food. Dishes can be tailored in spiciness, ample selection of meat and vegetarian dishes. I have only done take-out to date, but am very satisfied after no less than 1/2 dozen visits.  More reviews after I dine-in.
U get Golgappa here. I was always longing to eat Golgappas and found here. Though Aloo- channa mixture was more so prepared in American style. Pani still had desi flavour in it. loved it. Samosas were normal like any other restaurant. If u want to have chats exclusively, this is the place.

The reviews and the place boasted about how great samosa chat they make and the restaurant also has a certificate for winning some accolades for their samosa chat.. But I can tell u it's the worst samosa chat I tasted in my life.. Stay away!!

Very good food! Friendly service. Always enjoy a meal there!
This place is a nice little find. The first impression I had was that it had to be good when there were plenty of other patrons enjoying meals, who were obviously of an Indian background themselves. It's easy for anyone to judge if a meal is good or not, but when there are patrons who know the food better than those who are not Indian, that is a pretty good sign. My husband and I went on a recommendation of a coworker who is of the Indian background. I'm so glad he suggested eating here, as my meal was quite delicious. I started out with a Samosa Chaat. This is a tasty little dish served with chick peas, onion, yogurt, mint, and tamarind chutney. There is a little touch of heat, but nothing crazy. I can't reiterate how tasty this was.  My main course was chicken tikka masala. They went light on the heat with this, so if you want no heat, order it mild. I ordered it medium and thought it was still a bit too weak. I'm not the type to like a ton of heat in my food, so that should give you an idea that they play it safe. I think next time I might actually order it hot. When this was discussed with the waitress she seemed to indicate that a lot of people don't care for a lot of heat. If you really want to feel the burn, you can order your dish in what she referred to as "Indian hot" as they use a whole different level of spices. Just keep this in mind based upon your tolerance. I'm going back again very shortly,

Yelp doesn't offer a zero rating. That is the only reason i am giving a 1-star to this place. Everything right from the welcome, ambiance , and most important of all, the taste, was really bad. To start off, we ordered mango lassi which had a very bad after-taste. We ordered pakoras, which were half cooked and the mix was really really bad. Samosa channa was the worst i have ever tasted in this country. The channa was totally bland. Vegetable briyani was totally useless and tasteless. Whoever cooked these food should go back and learn cooking before running this restaurant. The only time the lady at the counter smiled was when we paid the bill. All the items were priced on the higher side. It was total waste of money. I was in fact relieved to just pay and leave the place. I would totally not recommend this place to anyone.

After reading the reviews on yelp, my SO and I decided to try Delhi Chaat. I have driven by this place numerous times, but being so tiny, I didn't expect it to be a restaurant. I'm so glad that I found reviews on here and decided to give it a try! The price was right and the food was delicious. I ordered the chana masala with a side of naan. Both were cooked to perfection. The masala was spicy and delicious - possibly one of the best I've ever tasted! My SO ordered the multiple course dinner option w/ chicken (there is also a vegetarian option). His dinner came with two vegetable based dishes and two chicken dishes, in addition to rice, a side of  chips with dipping sauce, and rice pudding. It was so much food, but for such a little price. He enjoyed every bit of it and I enjoyed tasting the different items, too! (I apologize, but I am not sure what each dish was called.) Oh, and the rice pudding? I'm not usually a rice pudding fan, but if this is how it is supposed to taste, then I'll be ordering it more often - and from Delhi Chaat. It was a sweet, delicious treat at the end of our meal and I was begging for more when it was finished! Overall, we had a great experience. The staff is very attentive, the food is hot and delicious, and the price is just right. Delhi Chaat, you just won yourself a repeat customer. Can't wait to join you again soon for dinner! (Or perhaps that lunch buffet you offer!) UPDATE: We returned again last night and the meal was again top-notch. Also, the staff really deserves an award for customer service. They are very sweet and attentive. You feel more like friends than a customer. :)

Just when I had all but given up on finding good Indian food in Buffalo along comes Delhi Chaat. Great, one less thing to complain about. So, where to start? Well, I could go on a rampage and go into all of the horrid Indian food experiences I've had recently. Taste of India? More like Waste of India. I'll cut to the chase. Delhi Chaat is more than just an Indian restaurant. It is a new standard for Buffalo. It's a new world to explore or rediscover. The chef has the most subtle yet powerful hand I've ever experienced. I'm usually all in for heavy handed, overly oily and spicy Indian. I love Lahore Tikka in Toronto, Ravi Kabob in DC, Muhib in London. Delhi Chaat taught me something tonight. It taught me that food can have all the punch that I love but can also be nuanced and refined. We spoke to the co-owner for some time. He's young, enthusiastic, has in depth knowledge of other good Indian restaurant standards and best of all loves the food he serves. You might think from the name that they focus on chaat or that they sell mostly street food. That's not at all the case. They have a great variety of these (including idly) as well as a display case of traditional deserts but they also have a massive menu with all the favorites and some specialties. If you want a real treat go for the lamb biryani and ask them to whip you up a goat curry (not on the menu). My hope is that there are enough people in Buffalo who appreciate authentic Indian food to make Delhi Chaat a very successful destination. And, as far as I'm concern it is the only Indian restaurant in Buffalo worth going to.

Delhi is the capital of India & Chaat means spicy savory snacks! Typical famous chaats in India : Bhel puri Sev poori Paani poori Pav Bhaji Aloo Ragda Chole Bhatoore You can wiki or google to see the meaning :) but originally this place is famous for these snacks. The place is a family owned place who took over the Moti Mahal & turned it into their dream Restaurant. The family owned a small cart before this and were famous for their Chole-Bhatoore. Its still their specialty. They cooked chicken makhni too which was their another hit. When it was time to bring their specialty to a wider audience then they bought the Moti Mahal and expanded their line of specialties with snacks & Indian meals combo. Finally they had to change their heat levels according to the audience. I ate the Lunch buffet which is much local Indian food and hence was much captivating for me. Price is just $8.00 and has 3 different Meat dishes. Chana masala: Much better than other place but still cannot call it authentic . The best ones are in NJ. Kadi pakora: Fritters cooked in yogurt and lentil flour . Its a famous local dish in west of India and traditionally made with leftover sour yogurt+ green chillies paste+ Bengal gram flour. This one here was less spicy and more sour. Fritters had little undercooked batter. But overall it was good to eat with Naan. Fritters/Pakora: The sprinkled chaat masala on top gives it the kick but still this one needs a lot of improvement as it said Mix veg pakoras and i couldn't find a single veg. Saag paneer: Much better and tastes good. Aloo Rajma: Well,even though this combination was a little out of order for me as it didn't turn out to be what it is supposed to be but I liked the way it tasted though and was spiced right among rest of the veg choices. Salad Bar: loved the spicy sour mango pickle. Sweets: Gulabjamun here rocks & rice pudding was better than others but where are the nuts? Overall its much home like environment and good food when compared to others. I like to eat here as i love their hospitality and service.

I'm grateful to Yelp for helping me find this little gem of great Indian food in the suburbs of Buffalo. This place has had the best Indian food I've tried in Buffalo. (I prefer it to Kabab & Curry, Taste of India, Taj Grill and others I've tried). Their Chana Masala (chickpea with tomato spices) was my favorite dish when it was priced at $7.99, but recently they raised its price. It was too good to be true at $7.99 :(. They are famous for their appetizer (and won the 2012 Taste of Buffalo award for Best Vegetarian Food for it): the Samosa Chaat. I highly recommend it -- it has always satisfied my Indian food craving. Their chicken and lamb is also delicious. Their $7.99 lunch buffet is great to sample what they have to offer, but don't expect to always have your water refilled by the staff if you're a big water drinker like myself. I probably end up asking "May I have some more water please?" three times during my buffet. It's too bad they've never gotten the hint yet :( Bobby (the owner) is a friendly guy and will always take care of you, but he's not always there -- and the wait staff is not always the most present to your needs.

Absolutely the best Indian food in Buffalo.  I'm a new PhD student at UB and this little strip mall Indian place has been the go-to restaurant for my wife and I when looking for a nice/cheap meal heading to or from school. I'm a vegetarian and hunting down good Indian food places is one of my favorite activities.  The menu is extremely good for vegetarians -- some regular favorites are their samosa chaat, dal makhani, and the farmer's cheese that comes with their naan. After a couple months in town, I already feel like a regular at this place.  Extremely friendly folks.  I haven't had anything less than great food there. They also blast Bollywood music videos while you eat.  Plus in my book.

Didn't know about this place until I saw the reviews/mentions on yelp and Im glad i got to try it especially since its so close to me. We came here on today (sunday) for the weekend lunch buffet ($10/person) and it was delicious. I can definitely tell there's a difference in taste compared to Taste of India and Kabab & Curry as mentioned in other reviews. There's about ten dishes to choose from (besides the salad and desserts) and I was surprised that half were vegetarian options. Still my girlfriend and I both really enjoyed the food and had our own favorites. I really enjoyed the goat, lamb, and the chick peas dishes. My girlfriend liked the chicken and squash. They also served 4 fresh naans that still had the oil on it.

We had the chole chaat and it was absolutely delicious. The puri was cooked perfectly. The idli sambar was great - the idli wasn't just white rice, but had some added ingredients (different grains, herbs) that made it delicious. Definitely recommend this place! They specialize in chaat, but also have a buffet with different meat dishes that looked good AND fresh baked naan (instead of sitting in the buffet all day).

Better than Taste of India, India Gate, and Kebab and Curry.  I came here once when it was still Moti Mahal and the food has improved tremendously.  The $8 lunch buffet doesn't taste like it's mass produced like at most other buffets and had a real home-cooked feel to it. also FYI, you can get restaurant.com coupon - only for dinner, minimum purchase $40 and not valid for buffet.

Fabulous chaat! I have also tried the other dishes and everything has been good so far.
This is my first Indian experience in Buffalo, and it was kind of disappointing. I went for the weekend buffet. I would say the wonderful highlights include the extremely friendly staff, weekend lunch buffet, and vegetarian options. Compared to my Indian buffet experiences in other cities, the buffet seemed small. It probably had 15 or so entrees, but almost half of them were vegetarian. The dishes were fine to good, but I thought many were kind of bland or boring. My favorite part of Indian buffets is finishing up with some gulab jamun and rice pudding. Their desserts were very disappointing....they were pudding with canned fruit cocktail dumped in it and Indian sugar fudge-like squares. I'm surprised by the rave reviews, and I must disagree. I appreciate their kindness and veggie options, but I do not plan to go back.

Well .. I hv been in buffalo for almost a decade nw .. I knw this place was owned by different people earlier .. Possibly the place is jinxed that the owner wud nt get a gud business here .. But let's talk abt delhi chaat .. The owner lady who also serves is too fond of chatting with customers and also insisting customers to order wht she likes .. that sometimes she forgets tht she has a customer in front of her and nt a little kid of her family ... Staff is very consistent .. Everytime I go thr, they make sure tht we do not get water refills ... I wud hv to wait for an hr ( or even more) once I am done eating n waiting for my check ... Food quality is ok but I wud nt rank it very high .. But whatever  quality of food thy hv .. Thr service is gud enough to spoil the appetite and mood of the customer ... Sorry guys ... Only 2 stars ..
Fabulous chaat! I have also tried the other dishes and everything has been good so far.
Being of the George Lucas generation, when I dine ethnic I like to think of myself as Henry Jones, Jr., a.k.a. Indiana Jones, THE ultimate adventurer, plumbing the depths searching for the Holy Grails of food.  If that means I stumble across the occasional chilled monkey brains, bad dates, or snake surprise, so be it, my solemn quest is to enjoy the finest foods of the world.  Of course, this means I occasionally experience a bout of dysentery, for example after enjoying a fine snake wine in Vietnam...with the decapitated serpentine bodies floating in the jug...Why did it have to be snakes??  However, like Indy I will gladly sacrifice my body for my obsession.   There are certain foods of legend, mostly street foods, which can only be found in their respective countries of origin or in the ethnic environs of large cities.  Unfortunately, Buffalo is usually bereft of such delights.  Think of the Bahn Mi Sandwich: an absolutely delicious amalgam of French influence on the Vietnamese Culture only found locally in its proper form (valiant effort Joe's Deli and Black Market Food Truck) at Niagara Seafood.  Another example is the Burmese Chicken Curry with Roti Prata another wonderful hybrid of an Indian Curry with the flavours of Southeast Asia only found locally at Sun Foods.  Yet my quest is far from complete.  I am tirelessly trying to find a great local Yakisoba, Shark's Fin or Bird's Nest Soup, Fugu, Menudo, Jamon Iberico, Ramen, Haggis or any of a million other delicacies treasured around the World with little success.  Yet my adventures continue...(cue the theme music) Finding Delhi Chaat was my equivalent of Indy finding the Ark of the Covenant in his back yard.  Delhi Chaat's speciality is snacks or chaat, which are mostly street foods found throughout India, usually seasoned with Masala Chaat, my new favorite (ridiculously complex) spice blend.  I've been to just about every Indian/Pakistani restaurant in town and there are some very unique and rare offerings here which can not be found anywhere else locally.  For example, Bhel Puri, which may be my favorite street food of all time.  Think Rice Krispies, mixed with various other crunchy bits, red onion, cilantro, tamarind chutney and a healthy dose of Masala Chaat.  Think crispy, spicy, sweet and delicious; a wonderful snack.   Another rare find is the Pav Bhaji, a Mumbai fast food treat.  The dish consists of a thick (yet not chunky) potato-based curry topped with red onions, lemon juice, cilantro and a pad of ghee (collectively Bhaji) served with a side of Pav (a heavily buttered, super soft Hamburger Roll) creating an open-faced delight.  It is like an Indian Sloppy Joe only about a billion times better. Now if I were an average adventurer I'd stop there, but like Indy I just kept digging.  The Chole Bhatura is a crowd favorite.  The Chole is a chick pea curry which has some deep, malty, spiced flavours.  This is paired with house-made achar (oil pickled vegetables with a strong flavour) and Bhatura.  Bhatura is a giant piece of fried dough, that inflates like a balloon when it fries.  It looks like something out of a molecular restaurant, and tastier than any fried dough you'll ever have at the fair.  My dining companions have gone crazy for this dish, and I don't think it's even on the regular menu. Yet the delights do not end there, try to find Pani Puri or Sev Puri anywhere else locally.  These dishes utilize small, fried shells called Puri (think mini-Bhatura, not as greasy) with holes cracked in the top so that one can stuff various items inside like red onions, cilantro and crispy fried bits.  The Pani Puri is served with a side of mint pani (a water flavored with mint, ginger and chilis), which is poured over the top.  The Sev Puri consist of pre-stuffed Puri with potatoes, crunchy bits and spices.   Now lets get into the super rare bits; the real finds.  How about Dhokla?  Dhokla is a very light and airy, savory cake made from a variety of whole spices and a fermented batter of chick pea flour, like an Indian corn bread.  It is absolutely wonderful, but not always available.  They also have the super rare Namkeen Mathri spiced with ajwain seeds (tiny seeds with an oregano/thyme flavor) or spicy chilis. These snacks are absolutely delicious fried, flaky biscuits (more cracker-like than bready), which I take home by the dozen and snack on all week. Finally, for those of you who love mozzarella sticks, you have got to try the paneer pakoras.  Paneer is a simple home-made cheese (like a firm ricotta) rolled in chick pea flour, deep fried and sprinkled with Masala Chat.  They are absolutely amazing dipped into Dehli Chaat's wonderful mint chutney. I'm not going to suggest that this menu does not have its pitfalls, see my previous review, but that's all part of being an adventurer.  So take the leap of faith, choose the proper grail and pray some crazed Thuggee doesn't rip out your heart.  Kali Ma Shakti De...Kali Ma Shakti De...
This is my first Indian experience in Buffalo, and it was kind of disappointing. I went for the weekend buffet. I would say the wonderful highlights include the extremely friendly staff, weekend lunch buffet, and vegetarian options. Compared to my Indian buffet experiences in other cities, the buffet seemed small. It probably had 15 or so entrees, but almost half of them were vegetarian. The dishes were fine to good, but I thought many were kind of bland or boring. My favorite part of Indian buffets is finishing up with some gulab jamun and rice pudding. Their desserts were very disappointing....they were pudding with canned fruit cocktail dumped in it and Indian sugar fudge-like squares. I'm surprised by the rave reviews, and I must disagree. I appreciate their kindness and veggie options, but I do not plan to go back.
All the basics, decent prices, nice people working there, and a fine atmosphere.  But nothing too exciting.  I'd eat there again, sure, but will I crave it?  No.   We had samoas, palak paneer, jeera aloo, naan, and some dessert.  All was good, but not too spicy.  I don't mean hot-spicy, but spice-spicey.  It was rather bland. For an Indian place, the decor was rather subdued.  Where were the crazy lights hanging from the ceiling reflected in the wall of mirrors?  Not here.  I, for one, was a little disappointed.   Good place for safe Indian food, especially if you're dining with people who aren't really into Indian food.
Well .. I hv been in buffalo for almost a decade nw .. I knw this place was owned by different people earlier .. Possibly the place is jinxed that the owner wud nt get a gud business here .. But let's talk abt delhi chaat .. The owner lady who also serves is too fond of chatting with customers and also insisting customers to order wht she likes .. that sometimes she forgets tht she has a customer in front of her and nt a little kid of her family ... Staff is very consistent .. Everytime I go thr, they make sure tht we do not get water refills ... I wud hv to wait for an hr ( or even more) once I am done eating n waiting for my check ... Food quality is ok but I wud nt rank it very high .. But whatever  quality of food thy hv .. Thr service is gud enough to spoil the appetite and mood of the customer ... Sorry guys ... Only 2 stars ..
In my quest to find which of the many local Indian restaurants will win the coveted  title of "my favorite Indian place", we tried Delhi Chaat last night.  Our 12-year old declared that his curried chicken is now his "favorite food.  Ever."  This alone is a compliment to the place, as this kid usually scarfs down whatever is in front of him without bothering to even notice if it tastes good or not. The Pros:  The food was really good, and they had a nice menu with many selections.  Even for a picky vegetarian like myself, there were many options (which is common for Indian fare, but I was still impressed by their non-meat fare).   Also, their salted lassi was freakin' delicious.   The Cons:  The tables were far too small for a group of four, like us, who ordered appetizers and multiple entrées and drinks and breads;  It was very cramped.  Also, even thought the staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful, they were not the easiest to find when you wanted a drink refill or had a question (but to be fair, they *were* busy that night). All in all, I wasn't blown away, but we did really enjoy the food and our night.  I will gladly go there again to eat, and I added their take-out menu to my ridiculously nerdy giant book of take-out menus.

Not so good. We went here looking at the ratings and review ppl added for this. Not worth the money and time at all. Small place, limited seating, poor ambience and with all this over priced and tasteless food. And ya, did I mentioned poor attitude and customer satisfaction too.

I go to Delhi Chaat to ONLY eat chaat and get some mango lassi because the taste is very close to the chaats I had growing up in Mumbai. Their samosas are hands down the best in Buffalo! I have had mixed experiences with their lunch/dinner menus - which means that it lacks consistency in taste and portions.

Simple place with good food. But the chaat items are better!
