It's been four years since I ate at Maxie's, but every time I drink a Bloody Mary I think about Maxie's perfect bloody garnished with shrimp and how the one I'm drinking isn't as good. I used to date a guy in Ithaca, and when I rolled into town late Friday night, we'd go to Maxie's for poboys. The cornbread is fabulous and a waiter once told me the secret of their divine honey butter: orange juice. The crabcakes are light and flaky, not like the salty doorstops they make in New England, and the jambalaya is heavy with shrimp and andouille. Portions are huge, atmosphere is fun yet romantic, and everything is so reasonably priced. Maxie's, maybe I'll be back someday.
I like Maxie's a lot.  Their bleu cheeseburger is delicious, they have good drinks, and great desserts.  Service is usually good.  Great ambiance - usually fairly loud, but in a joyful way.
Ideal spot for a late lunch, especially after you've spent the day being one with Nature (Taughannock Falls is just a short drive away) Half price oysters, po boys and some cold drinks really hit the spot. It got pretty crowded after 5pm on Saturday so plan ahead if you're going to get here later than that.
My most favorite restaurant in Ithaca (so far)!  I haven't had a plate I didn't like (yet).  I love the cornbread, the fries, the catfish...even the pickle slices are good!  (And I don't like pickles.)  Friendly waiters and just great Southern cooking.  Last time I was there, an old man was playing jazz solo, and it was great.  Sometime I'd like to have drinks at this bar instead of going to the other bars in town.
Maxie's is a must visit restaurant in Ithaca. I like the food, so delicious! The services are great too!
Seafood, cajun, creole southern style place with a great menu offering great appetizers, wonderful soups, an ever changing raw bar,  sides, sandwiches, full entrees, and delicious desserts.  You can easily pick from the menu to make a meal of your choosing.  What I love most about Maxie's is their hours extra long hours and everything is served from open to close.  One of my favorite places for a late dinner or snack.  I have gotten a variety of things from here, from full dinners to stopping in for small items like sandwiches or just desserts.  Every time I am pleased.  The service is wonderful no matter if you are ordering french fries or a full course expensive dinner.  I love their complementary corn bread with orange butter, and their crab soup.  Their wine list is also great with a variety of bottle prices starting at $20.  Great choices by the glass too.
A few friends and I ventured out to Maxie's as the previous school year drew to a close. Two of them had dined there before but it was a first for me and our friend from SoCal. The Grub -- * Cajun-Seared Ahi Tuna ($25.95) - Sorghum butter, horseradish potato cake, roasted garlic tossed spinach * Corn Bread (Free App.) - Accompanied by a light but flavorful butter * Piggy Platter ($22.50) - Pulled pork and rib combo with creamy slaw, bbq beans Venue Review -- As soon as we stepped into the restaurant my nostrils were greeted with the aroma of sweet cornbread. Also wafting around the room were the smells of a variety of fish and BBQ meats. If I was told to close my eyes and was led into the restaurant, I would've believed I was brought into a beachfront seafood specialty diner! It probably helped that the weather was warmer than usual for the area and seagulls were squawking nearby... Maxie's is a cozy spot with both indoor and outdoor seating (covered). Food Review -- As soon as we were seated, the waiter presented us with a basket of cornbread. It was warm, moist, and sweet (in a word, perfect). The butter that came with it might have had additional flavoring as well because it made the cornbread taste tenfold better. I ordered the Cajun-Seared Ahi Tuna, an item I've tried at various seafood restaurants and usually with great satisfaction. That said, I had some high expectations for the Tuna - it did not disappoint.What was new about the Ahi Tuna was that it was served on top of a horseradish potato cake (think of mashed potato stuffed in a fried/crunchy shell). I think it really stole the show, blending well with the garlic tossed spinach and tongue-prickling spiciness of the fish. Our Socal friend ordered the Piggy Platter and barely got a quarter into it before claiming she was full. I was in luck! The thing about the platter is, what it lacks in bold flavors, it makes up for with sheer size. The portion was VERY generous (it could have fed the Donner party) and dwarfed the Tuna that I had ordered. Before I forget, we also got a platter of oysters at Market Price. Don't miss out on these because they're the claim to fame here! Service Review -- It's been a while since I was at the restaurant, but I remember that we had very prompt service. The occasion and the people really contributed to the experience, but I have no complaints about service. Definitely a fun spot to go with friends, family, or perhaps even a night out? Overall Impression -- So there you have it, the venue itself provides great ambiance and in fair weather is reminiscent of a shoreline seafood restaurant. The reason for a 3 star is that although excellent for this area, Maxie's just doesn't compare to authentic seafood restaurants. In addition, some dishes blatantly push quantity over quality so it's a slight gamble (ask your waiter for recommendations! They're a cheerful lot.) Prices could be a little on the high-end, but I'd come again for sure.
One of my favorites in Ithaca. Just a fun place to go with friends and the food is great.
I liked Maxie's Supper club.  I liked the name, I like the comfortableness and somewhat hip feel of the place.  The waiters, waitress's are all young, attractive and pleasant.  Food is acceptable.  I thought the prices were a little high for mediocre food. I had one issue here.  We came in at 6:01-6:02...and I told the waiter that we would have the 2 for 1 Oysters as appetizers ONLY if we could get the 2 for 1 price (which ended at 6PM).  He said..."Ummmm...I'll have to check, because it ends at 6PM."  Well, cuz you know oysters are expensive Being only a few minutes past 6...I figured he could work it out.  And if he COULD make it happen, then we would like a big plate of Oysters......if not, then we would not want any oysters. I figured if it was a question of giving us the order for half price...or not ordering them at all, the manager would rather see us run up our bill....than skip the appetizers altogether. He brought the big plate of oysters and I figured he came thru for us.  Yay! Well, the bill came, and I realized that he had charged me full price.  When I questioned this, he said "I checked and was told that we couldn't offer the half-price since it was a couple of minutes past 6".  Which is fine, but I wouldn't have ordered them otherwise.  I asked my tablemates if I was clear when I spoke to him, and they all remember me saying to skip it if we could get the 1/2 price offer. Not wanting to get into a to-do over it with a group of people....I simply deducted the amount of the discount I was expecting from his tip.  (And I usually tip well.)  I figured I wasn't going to pay for this...and since it was his fault, he was. I can't tell if this was a simple misunderstanding...or a waiter trying to "pull something". I would go there again, but again, go over the bill item by item.
Excellent food and service. I have become a regular when in town. Oysters during happy hour are wonderful and a good value. Chicken, cajun fries, fish fry, and fried green tomatoes are excellent. Other menu items look and sound just as good, but I have not had the opportunity to experience them yet.  They have a very good selection of quality beers on tap. They have good quality live music on select nights, starting about 6 or 6:30.
Had dinner here after helping a friend of a friend move into her dorm at Cornell. I'm not a seafood eater, so that limited a lot of my options from the menu. Despite that, I was able to order the fried chicken po' boy, with sweet potato fries. The sweet potato fries came out with mayo dipping sauce (thankfully, not ketchup). The nice crunch of the chicken was delicious, and combined with the mayo, the meal became a nice comfort food moment for me. I'd recommend this place if you're in the Finger Lakes area, it was a very lively restaurant and I'm sure seafood lovers will enjoy their meal!
Went there for dinner last night, and thought it was just okay.  I had been expecting it to be much better given some of the reviews I've read, which probably influenced my experience (high expectations are rarely met).  We were seated in the leftmost room closest to the kitchen, and so you could smell the food being cooked (for me, not a good thing because the smell of cooking fish was not that enjoyable).  The cornbread was good, but a bit too sweet to be great.  I ordered the crabcakes, and they came with the RWB coleslaw and sweet potato fries.  On the plus side, the crabcakes had plenty of crab and not too much filler.  On the other, the crab had a strong fishy smell and taste (perhaps it wasn't that fresh), and the texture was very strange (mushy).  It came topped with a bit of cajun aioli, which was tasty but there wasn't enough of it on top.  The sweet potato fries were fine... perhaps the fries had sat under the lights a little too long because they were a bit cold and almost soggy.  The coleslaw was really disgusting.  It was dressed with (slimy) blue cheese and vinegar.  Not a good taste combo.  My husband ordered a much better dish, the mixed grill special with grits and tasso gravy.  The tasso gravy was really delicious, although the shrimp and beef tenderloin that came with it were just ok.  Their andouille sausage was good, I wonder if they make it in house?  I am not going to rush back to Maxie's, although I would go there again if my friends were going or something.  I'd also get something simpler, like a po' boy.
Got the recommendation to go from my Professor, who also enjoys seafood. Got the Po-Boy, per his recommendation, and oh boy was it good! Very cool atmosphere too.
Ohmygosh YUM! Please just go. Stop reading reviews and just go to Maxie's--you won't regret it. We have been to Maxie's quite a few times, whether we were having a date night, were part of a larger party, or were part of a group that rented out the back of the bar area. Each experience has been absolutely stellar, both in terms of the service and the food itself. The 30-minute call-ahead seating is clutch, since it's such a popular place (especially on the weekend). While I'm not personally a fan of oysters, my friends have raved about them and how fresh they are, and the daily oyster happy hour (why does that make me think of oysters knocking back beers? that'd be great) seems to be a good deal. The specialty drinks are divine. I am a total sucker for a good bloody Mary, and their Cajun Bloody Mary is to die for. I've also had their Maker's Mint Julep and Supper Club Sidecar, which I highly recommend if you like bourbon (which I clearly do...). As far as food, I've had the jambalaya, gumbo, pulled pork, and--one of the evening's specials--fish tacos. The fish tacos were...fish tacos. Meh. They were good but they weren't incredible. I would gladly order any of the others again and again though. The cornbread and Cajun fries are a-ma-zing, so ignore your diet and seriously go for it. The price of the food isn't exactly cheap, but I think the quality (and quantity) makes it well worth it. So just go already!
This place was EXCELLENT!  I was in Ithaca for a conference a few weeks ago and this was literally one of the only redeeming qualities of being there.  The grits were fantastic, as was the cornbread.  The portions were ENORMOUS, which was great since the food was super tasty.   This single experience made up for the 8000 million degree weather + 200% humidity + being away from the love of my life and my dog.  GO HERE!
If you're a fan of oysters, this is the place for you.  Even if you're not, Maxie's Supper club touts an extensive variety of foods that one would not expect.  I've tried their grilled portobello which was really good and satisfying.  The oyster sampler was fun, trying different kinds of oysters. The sweet potato fries are very good, and the sauce it comes with is creamy and delicious. Their desserts are very good, esecially the chocolate cake. This is a great place to come with a group of friends if you're looking for some good soulful heartwarming comfort food.
This place is like The Rocky Horror Picture Show, or horseracing. Some people love it, I don't get it. I've been probably six times, always with a group of friends foaming at the mouth for MAXIES!!!! It's okay, I guess? I never seem to find anything on the menu I'm head over heels for, and the prices don't help. Like Viva, the Boatyard and Mahogany Grill people continue to mindlessly be in love with a name and a place. The food... meh. p.s. The fact that this shows up as the #2 place to go if your parents visit is a travesty.
Great restaurant option in Ithaca! the vibe is cool and the food was pretty delicious.  In NYC this would get 3 stars, but in Ithaca it gets an extra point. The blakened catfish was pretty damn tasty and came with rice and beans that were acceptable. There was also entertainment besides the live music because of 2 very awkward first dates going on near us.  It was like dinner and a show!
Maxie's Supper Club is one of my favorite restaurants in Ithaca, hands down. Why? I mean it's just some Cajun food. Let me break it down for you. 1. Po Boy Sandwiches + Cajun Fries -Freaking delicious. Everyone seems to come here for the happy hour half off oysters, but what they don't realize is the Poy Boy sanwiches here are AMAZING even if you don't like seafood. The crab cake or half./half (fried shrimp/fried oyster) are the best by far. Ask for extra cajun mayo on the side so you can dip your cajun waffle fries in it. Heaven......... 2. Half-Off Oysters at Happy Hour -From 4-6 pm everyday, they have half off fresh oyster shooters. I love seafood so this is an awesome deal and the oysters always taste pretty fresh. There's like 3 different types of oysters so try them all and see what you like. 3. The Price -I wouldn't say the price is super cheap or anything, but definitely not bad for the quality and quantity of food. And lets say you come for half off oysters, it's a steal! If you're craving some Cajun food, definitely come here. Love this place, actually I'm craving some Maxie's right now. Sigh.
Ideal spot for a late lunch, especially after you've spent the day being one with Nature (Taughannock Falls is just a short drive away) Half price oysters, po boys and some cold drinks really hit the spot. It got pretty crowded after 5pm on Saturday so plan ahead if you're going to get here later than that.
i wouldnt take a date here but i would definitely meet with a group of friends to have a glass of wine and talk about everyones day. its a chill kind of place and the wait staff leave you alone if you dont want to be bothered. wear whatever you want, its super casual. i think there might be a bar but it was pretty slow on a Monday night so I didnt get the real vibe of the place. perhaps weekends are hopping?
SETTING: Numerous occasions with friends, family, dates, etc. DECOR: Deep jewel tones to go with wall colors and beads they sometimes hand out. Simple, artsy, chill. STAFF: Friendly. Always a hustle and bustle. Layers of staff. (Full parking and nearly full tables on the Tuesday after Labor Day for dinner.) MENU: I work my favorites since $13 for portobello is too high for my liking and the Jambalaya is too spicy for this English lady. 1) Slightly-warmed cornbread with orange honey butter, 2) Fried green tomatoes with remolade. Beaded goodness. 3) Sweet Potato fries with (sour) cream sauce. (Perfectly crispy. I add extra salt. 4) RedWhite&Bleu cole slaw (red&white cabbage with bleu cheese) 5) Sometimes... their vegetarian red beans with rice. (protein needed somehow) DESSERTS: Remembered fondly. VERDICT: Loud atmosphere from time to time (acoustics issue as much as "crowd") but otherwise good for friends, girl's night out, date, family, etc. I'll be back.

I went here on the advice of my good friend from Ithaca. I went of a night when there wasn't live music, but the place was still a buzz and the atmosphere pleasant. They had some nice beers on tap and lots of choices for liquor-drinking folks. I was extremely pleased the the complimentary corn bread that they serve; it's was so damn good! The appetizers and entrees were equally terrific and served in large portions. I liked my Jumbalaya so much that I couldn't wait to eat my leftovers for breakfast the next day!

I'd recommend this place if you're in the Finger Lakes area, it was a very lively restaurant and I'm sure seafood lovers will enjoy their meal!
I was surprised that this place had a nice vegetarian menu. It was hard to choose what to order, but I ended up getting the supper club salad and a side of rough cut fries. I got a large salad, thinking I was going to share. Turns out I ate the whole thing. It's a nice, fresh salad. The fries were good but my fellow diners' cajun fries (which come with many dishes) were just so awesome that mine didn't compare. GET THE CAJUN FRIES. THEY'RE SO GOOD. The service, though, saddened me. Our server was irritable, sarcastic, and rude.  At the end of the meal, our server held out her open hand so we could pass her our dirty plates. I like to help the waitstaff, because I think waiting tables is often an underpaid and underappreciated profession. But it's like when your grandma offers you money for the groceries you brought for dinner at her house. You don't go in expecting it, but when it's offered you should take it graciously. Better service would go a long way, because the food here is pretty darn good.

We would give it a 3.5 if we could. The food was pretty good... Fish and chips were enough for two meals (at least). The pulled pork came out without BBQ sauce so I asked for some on the side... Tasty but had a kick to it! Use sparingly:) The waitress was more than willing to review the menu with me in terms of what was gluten free and what I should avoid..major plus. It was extremely dark inside and we couldn't see our food at all. Also, we were in and out of there in a half hour... Made us wonder how much of our food was just sitting under a warmer before we walked in.  All in all, a great meal though and the prices were right!

We ate at Maxi's on a Sunday night that happened to be St Patty's Day.  The Finger Lakes Distillery whiskey flight was a nice intro to their version of whiskey and bourbon, but not comparable if you like it Kentucky style.  My partner also had their special old-fashion made with Maker's, brown sugar, Peychaud's bitters, and muddled orange.  He is used to making his own at home with Booker's, sugar cube, Angostora bitters, and a twist of orange and lemon, but Maxie's version was a nice perspective. I ordered a ginger ale and the waiter offered that they have Ithaca ginger beer, so I had to try that.  And not to be left out in the festivities, I asked for spiced rum -- since my choices were Capt Morgan or Kraken, I chose the latter.  It made one delish dark and stormy! My partner ordered 2 each of the happy hour oysters and they came out with fresh grated horseradish, drawn butter, cocktail sauce, and lemon, which is a lot more choices than I've seen at other restaurants.  He said that they were quite fresh and good. He had the fried oyster po boy which came with seasoned waffle fries and housemade pickles.  He chose to skip the bread as he was saving room for dessert. I ordered the fried chicken po boy and that first bite I had was delicious with the additional cajun mayo!  Too bad that my allergic tongue detected the trace amount of shrimp in the oil, which was a chance I took since the waiter told me that they use the same oil when he took the order. The waiter was so kind to take the plate away and bring the menu again.  This time I ordered the iceberg wedge with cajun ranch, bacon bits, and chicken, which was delicious but still I drooled after those seasoned waffle fries. For dessert, we had local Purity brand ice cream, one scoop of vanilla, one scoop of Bulldog crunch, and it was screaming good! Overall, even though it was a full house, the customer service was amazing and the food was delicious!  Dinner for two with drinks and dessert came out to significantly less than it would cost in Manhattan or Brooklyn pub. We will be sure to visit again next time we are in the Finger Lakes region!
This place is like The Rocky Horror Picture Show, or horseracing. Some people love it, I don't get it. I've been probably six times, always with a group of friends foaming at the mouth for MAXIES!!!!

The fact that this shows up as the #2 place to go if your parents visit is a travesty.
Finally got to hit up happy hour half-off oysters on the night before Thanksgiving.  Oysters were DELICIOUS.  The chowder and sides were just ok, but maybe I'm just not a fan of Cajun food. Next time I'm getting a drink (or two) and a platter of two dozen oysters and I'll be as happy as a clam.. which might make me a semi-cannibal I guess.
I'm am from out of town for the race this weekend, needless to say I try and eat somewhat healthy.  Normally creole food wouldn't be a genre I would consider as health food, but Ithika's great little rendition of the deep south was a pleasant surprise.  Not only did the menu include some healthy alternatives, but the food was amazing. I'm from the San Francisco bay area which is known for it's culinary diverse palette , and with the travel my career includes I get around to quite a few restaurants in the world. Maxie's has put a touch on Louisiana's flavor I have never seen before. I'd recommend the portabello platter, as well as the sweet potato fries. If that doesn't strike your taste buds, the Ahi tuna should take care of you. Disappointment is not an option
Maxie's Supper Club is one of my favorite restaurants in Ithaca, hands down. Why? I mean it's just some Cajun food. Let me break it down for you. 1.

Please order the shimp and grits with andouille sausage. One of the best meals I've ever had. Great beers on tap, amazing cornbread and free live blues on Sundays and Tuesdays. I highly recommend Maxies.
i wouldnt take a date here but i would definitely meet with a group of friends to have a glass of wine and talk about everyones day. its a chill kind of place and the wait staff leave you alone if you dont want to be bothered. wear whatever you want, its super casual. i think there might be a bar but it was pretty slow on a Monday night so I didnt get the real vibe of the place. perhaps weekends are hopping?
I was here just awhile back - just getting into reviews on yelp - sorry for the delay.  Everything about this joint is awesome!  Go early for happy hour sit at the bar and have the Oysters on special!  The fried chicken was as it should be, moist, crunchy and delicious.  This will be a new favorite stop for me every time I'm in town!
We've been to Maxie's a couple of times already, but we've only ever gotten one dish: the Jambalaya "Me-Oh-My-A," which is so massive and the flavors are so rich that, (after eating the complementary cornbread--which rocks), the two of us have never been able to finish a single order. Someday, maybe when we aren't students, we'll branch out, but until then... that dish is all we need. We like the Mojito as far as drinks go, which goes along refreshingly with the somewhat spicy jambalaya. Moving on, Maxie's has a vibrant atmosphere; trim tables and low lighting still make the place feel intimate, despite the noise level however, which is probably above average. The service here has always been professional, even exemplary. One time, my girlfriend left her coat inside and the server ran outside to return it to us; luckily we were still in the parking lot. Definitely check Maxie's out.

I went here on the advice of my good friend from Ithaca. I went of a night when there wasn't live music, but the place was still a buzz and the atmosphere pleasant. They had some nice beers on tap and lots of choices for liquor-drinking folks. I was extremely pleased the the complimentary corn bread that they serve; it's was so damn good!

When you're looking for a meal in Ithaca from people who love food - serving it, eating it, and talking about it, Maxie's is definitely the place to be and go.  Oh, and if you like drinkin', this ain't a bad spot, either. Our server was fantastic.  She knew the specials, she spoke knowledgably about them, and make great recommendations on a specialty cocktail when we weren't really sure about what we wanted.   We had some kick-ass oysters, and split some insanely good cajun catfish.  It was a great meal all the way around.   Next time I'm in Ithaca, I'm going BACK! Some tips: Half-price oysters from 4-6 Mon-Fri $10 off bottles of wine on Monday nights Chicken Fried Tuesdays with live music
Mmmmmm.... certainly a fan of Maxie's after my recent visit to Ithaca.  The reviews were helpful, so thank you!! I took a few colleagues here for dinner after a work event, and we were all extremely pleased with our meals.  I included pictures of everyone's eats -- SO GOOD!   There was no wait when we arrived, so we were immediately seated by a friendly hostess, and our server wasn't far behind.  We knew that there were half-off oysters from 4-6pm, so we each started with a sampler of their local fare (note: even with the discount, the oysters really are kind of pricey compared to the rest of the menu).  I had a "Provincial" cocktail, which was essentially a cosmo made with a rye vodka -- and yes, you can taste the difference.  It wasn't a bad difference, but it was nice and strong.   The oysters were uber fresh, and they were served in a manner so that we could identify which oysters were which in our samplers.  I ordered the shrimp and grits, one friend had the fried green tomato po' boy, and our other friend ordered the chicken-fried chicken breast.  Everything was delicious.  My grits were creamy, the shrimp were big and perfectly cooked in a savory sauce that made me wish I hadn't ordered the half order.  :-/ My friends raved about their food as well, and I moved on to a cajun bloody Mary before we decided to share a dessert.  Mine seemed to be missing the cajun, but really that's probably the biggest complaint I had.   For dessert, the three of us shared a chocolate bread pudding that was sweet, moist and delicious without being heavy.  Seriously, I want to be sent on another business trip to Ithaca just so that I get the chance to visit Maxie's again.
I was surprised that this place had a nice vegetarian menu. It was hard to choose what to order, but I ended up getting the supper club salad and a side of rough cut fries. I got a large salad, thinking I was going to share. Turns out I ate the whole thing. It's a nice, fresh salad. The fries were good but my fellow diners' cajun fries (which come with many dishes) were just so awesome that mine didn't compare. GET THE CAJUN FRIES. THEY'RE SO GOOD. The service, though, saddened me. Our server was irritable, sarcastic, and rude.  At the end of the meal, our server held out her open hand so we could pass her our dirty plates. I like to help the waitstaff, because I think waiting tables is often an underpaid and underappreciated profession. But it's like when your grandma offers you money for the groceries you brought for dinner at her house. You don't go in expecting it, but when it's offered you should take it graciously. Better service would go a long way, because the food here is pretty darn good.
We love this place for oysters, particularly if you get there at happy hour (4 - 6 PM) when they're half price.  When put together with a good ale or champagne as is my wife's preference, they're wonderful.  It can be a bit of a challenge if the bar is crowded as the bartender often doubles as the oyster shucker but the young ladies I've seen in this position are about as good as it gets and they really manage to do things remarkably well given that they manage to both shuck the oysters and pour drinks at the same time. On our last visit we had dinner for the first time.  The shrimp and grits I had were wonderful.  Very spicy.  My wife had a shrimp po boy that was equally tasteful.  Live music in the bar.
We would give it a 3.5 if we could. The food was pretty good... Fish and chips were enough for two meals (at least). The pulled pork came out without BBQ sauce so I asked for some on the side... Tasty but had a kick to it! Use sparingly:) The waitress was more than willing to review the menu with me in terms of what was gluten free and what I should avoid..major plus. It was extremely dark inside and we couldn't see our food at all. Also, we were in and out of there in a half hour... Made us wonder how much of our food was just sitting under a warmer before we walked in.  All in all, a great meal though and the prices were right!
High price  and low quantity for a premium Scotch make the premium restaurants in Manhattan look reasonable.
We ate at Maxi's on a Sunday night that happened to be St Patty's Day.  The Finger Lakes Distillery whiskey flight was a nice intro to their version of whiskey and bourbon, but not comparable if you like it Kentucky style.  My partner also had their special old-fashion made with Maker's, brown sugar, Peychaud's bitters, and muddled orange.  He is used to making his own at home with Booker's, sugar cube, Angostora bitters, and a twist of orange and lemon, but Maxie's version was a nice perspective. I ordered a ginger ale and the waiter offered that they have Ithaca ginger beer, so I had to try that.  And not to be left out in the festivities, I asked for spiced rum -- since my choices were Capt Morgan or Kraken, I chose the latter.  It made one delish dark and stormy! My partner ordered 2 each of the happy hour oysters and they came out with fresh grated horseradish, drawn butter, cocktail sauce, and lemon, which is a lot more choices than I've seen at other restaurants.  He said that they were quite fresh and good. He had the fried oyster po boy which came with seasoned waffle fries and housemade pickles.  He chose to skip the bread as he was saving room for dessert. I ordered the fried chicken po boy and that first bite I had was delicious with the additional cajun mayo!  Too bad that my allergic tongue detected the trace amount of shrimp in the oil, which was a chance I took since the waiter told me that they use the same oil when he took the order. The waiter was so kind to take the plate away and bring the menu again.  This time I ordered the iceberg wedge with cajun ranch, bacon bits, and chicken, which was delicious but still I drooled after those seasoned waffle fries. For dessert, we had local Purity brand ice cream, one scoop of vanilla, one scoop of Bulldog crunch, and it was screaming good! Overall, even though it was a full house, the customer service was amazing and the food was delicious!  Dinner for two with drinks and dessert came out to significantly less than it would cost in Manhattan or Brooklyn pub. We will be sure to visit again next time we are in the Finger Lakes region!
Nice little corner spot!  Great place to go with family/friends that are visiting.  The servers are great and very knowledgable.  You can tell al lot of care has gone into the menu, staffing, and overall mission statement.   You won't find any place with similar food in Ithaca! I've never experienced a wait but could imagine on big college days (i.e. orientation and graduation) Huge bloody marys are always welcomed in my book and I will guiltily admit we had a couple Maxi's Supper Club pint glasses in our house...(I might still)
Finally got to hit up happy hour half-off oysters on the night before Thanksgiving.  Oysters were DELICIOUS.  The chowder and sides were just ok, but maybe I'm just not a fan of Cajun food. Next time I'm getting a drink (or two) and a platter of two dozen oysters and I'll be as happy as a clam.. which might make me a semi-cannibal I guess.
I was visiting some friends in Ithaca and they decided to take me to Maxie's for dinner on a Tuesday night. There's live music here on Tuesday nights, which was a nice touch. It wasn't too crowded at 9pm, so we were seated quickly. I had a vodka-based drink called a tipsy gardener which was one of the most delicious cocktails I can remember having. Very tasty drink! We gobbled up a basket of cornbread which was fine because we were given another one no sooner than we had finished. I had the BBQ shrimp & french bread appetizer which was very good. For the main course, I opted for the crab cake po'boy with a side of cajun fries, both of which I'd highly recommend. Everything was great here! The servers were friendly, the atmosphere lovely, the drinks were delicious, and the food was super tasty. All in all, I had a great time here and if you ever find yourself in Ithaca, be sure to drop by Maxie's. It's awesome!
I'm am from out of town for the race this weekend, needless to say I try and eat somewhat healthy.  Normally creole food wouldn't be a genre I would consider as health food, but Ithika's great little rendition of the deep south was a pleasant surprise.  Not only did the menu include some healthy alternatives, but the food was amazing. I'm from the San Francisco bay area which is known for it's culinary diverse palette , and with the travel my career includes I get around to quite a few restaurants in the world. Maxie's has put a touch on Louisiana's flavor I have never seen before. I'd recommend the portabello platter, as well as the sweet potato fries. If that doesn't strike your taste buds, the Ahi tuna should take care of you. Disappointment is not an option
Please order the shimp and grits with andouille sausage. One of the best meals I've ever had. Great beers on tap, amazing cornbread and free live blues on Sundays and Tuesdays. I highly recommend Maxies.
A great oyster po'boy!
Maxie's is an interesting place. The waitstaff were all wearing crazy costumes, the space is small and loud, and the mood is rather light-hearted, but it manages to keep a touch of class. We shared some raw oysters - my first time having them. Unfortunately I can't say much about them because I have nothing to compare them to, but they are sold individually, which was convenient, and there are two types available. I then had a crab cake po'boy with cajun fries. Unfortunately I'm going to have to say that both of those things were rather flavorless, but my accompanying mojito was spot-on. And the things near the ketchup are hand wipes, not sugar packets.
I was here just awhile back - just getting into reviews on yelp - sorry for the delay.  Everything about this joint is awesome!  Go early for happy hour sit at the bar and have the Oysters on special!  The fried chicken was as it should be, moist, crunchy and delicious.  This will be a new favorite stop for me every time I'm in town!
Didn't like the atmosphere, mostly because it was too crowded and really loud. The table my friends and I got seated at was also uncomfortable because we ended up sitting on rickety wooden stools. The food itself was ok. Nothing to write home about.
We've been to Maxie's a couple of times already, but we've only ever gotten one dish: the Jambalaya "Me-Oh-My-A," which is so massive and the flavors are so rich that, (after eating the complementary cornbread--which rocks), the two of us have never been able to finish a single order. Someday, maybe when we aren't students, we'll branch out, but until then... that dish is all we need. We like the Mojito as far as drinks go, which goes along refreshingly with the somewhat spicy jambalaya. Moving on, Maxie's has a vibrant atmosphere; trim tables and low lighting still make the place feel intimate, despite the noise level however, which is probably above average. The service here has always been professional, even exemplary. One time, my girlfriend left her coat inside and the server ran outside to return it to us; luckily we were still in the parking lot. Definitely check Maxie's out.
When you're looking for a meal in Ithaca from people who love food - serving it, eating it, and talking about it, Maxie's is definitely the place to be and go.  Oh, and if you like drinkin', this ain't a bad spot, either. Our server was fantastic.  She knew the specials, she spoke knowledgably about them, and make great recommendations on a specialty cocktail when we weren't really sure about what we wanted.   We had some kick-ass oysters, and split some insanely good cajun catfish.  It was a great meal all the way around.   Next time I'm in Ithaca, I'm going BACK!

Corn bread is always one of my favorite. The oyster is fresh but pricy. Crab cake is tasty. There is a rice dish which is the first item in the specialist but it is just ok.

This place is supposed to an Ithacan favorite, but I've only been there once... and that was for graduation dinner. It was A-Okay. Their corn bread was very tasty, Jambalaya not so much, but their fish and fried oysters were delicious. Other than that, great atmosphere, and free stickers. Their logo is cute.

This high review is based on only one visit, but oh my, was it a good one.  I came up to Ithaca on business / fun with my friend.  Got seats at the bar.  The bartender/oyster shucker, Evie, was awesome.  Great server and could shuck oysters like a seasoned veteran.  The freshly grated horseradish and the other 2 sauces were perfect complementary flavors.  The best oysters I've ever had....and it was in a land locked city!! (apart from the Finger Lakes).  Ribs were supremely good and messy the way I like them.  The Bloody Mary was perfectly spiced. Everyone was so friendly in this big town.  Loved it.  Every person who goes to the Finger Lakes for wine, should take the time to stop here for the Oyster Happy Hour if you are passing through.
Central location, fun & swanky atmosphere, very friendly staff. Definately fun for a night out, drinks, and oysters if that's your thing! Fried green tomatoes and Ceasar salad were the absolute besssst I EVER had- and that's coming from a foodie! Jambalaya was yummy if you like spicy, Damn god fish fry was good but a little too much batter for my taste, and fried chicken Po' boy was good but nothing special - & they were all huge portions! A little pricey, but worth the experience Oh ya, the cornbread is nuts!!!!

The food here is really tasty! It was definitely one of the food highlights of my trip to the Finger Lakes. After our 3 hikes around the area with the Taughannock Falls being the last one, we decided to get some Cajun/Creole food. On the right side of the restaurant is where they play live southern music. Thankfully, we got seated at the quieter end. For appetizers, we ordered half a dozen oysters, fried green tomatoes and the crawfish popcorn. I've always had nasty oysters that taste like the sewer, but here the oysters were amazing! We had the 3 different types of oysters, I guess from three different areas, and you can really taste the difference in them. One of them was very oceany and a bit fishy, another was deliciously sweet, and the other was salty and briny. I never knew how good raw oysters are until I tried it here!! Definitely made this meal my highlight. The oysters are 2.95 a pop, so it was on the expensive side, unless you come during happy hour, which is then half off. The fried green tomatoes were good. It was my first time having them, and I thought they were tasty. But then again, anything fried is tasty! I didn't care for the remoulade on the side because the tomatoes were tasty on its own. The crawfish popcorn was so delicious as well! It was full of the deep shrimp flavor that makes crawfish so good. For entrees, I ordered the shrimp and grits with andouille sausage. The boyfriend ordered the jambalaya. The shrimp and grits was so tasty! It was so buttery and spicy and the shrimps were perfectly cooked. I usually hate dishes that are too buttery but this dish worked. The spiciness of it helped balance out the richness of the dish. The sausage was an add in for $4.50, and for the price, I can definitely do without it. It tasted like any other andouille sausage-smoky and salty. The dish would've been perfect except for the grits. Some of the grits were undercooked and kind of grainy, but overall, the dish was delicious. The jambalaya was good too. It had a real kick to it and it was very zesty as well. It was full of sausage. For dessert, we had the the blueberry cream pie. It was ok. It was similar to a key lime pie but with blueberries. It was tart but was filled with real blueberries. We could've done without dessert. Overall, Maxie's is a very tasty spot with the Southern hospitality! The servers were extremely nice and friendly. We will definitely be back if we come to the Finger Lakes again.

Just went here for dinner tonight and had a great time! Service was excellent and very prompt, waiter was very knowledgeable, they let us know as soon as we sat down what items they were out of for the night. Only downside was the collard greens which were bizarrely sweet instead of porky, but perhaps it was an off night or they got some of the hyper sweet butter that they serve on the cornbread. Cornbread is good but definitely a more northern style cornbread, pretty sweet as a baseline. Crawfish was excellent, gumbo was good (boyfriend was a huge fan, me not so much), shrimp and grits was excellent with the optional sausage on top and the fried chicken got rave reviews. Waiter said key lime pie was his favorite so we got that and the nightly special dessert, both of which were very good. Live music on Fridays and Tuesdays, which is when they have their fried chicken special! My only complaint would be that all that excellent food does add up fast, haha. Also they don't take reservations per se but they do have a call ahead seating line where you can ask for a table to be held for you in approximately thirty minutes, though we got there and found plenty of seating in the bar area and didn't end up needing the call-ahead line.
I recently moved to Ithaca to attend college and have found this place is by far my favorite so far. I have been there 3 times and take all my visiting guests there right away as a go to yummy dinner. They don't take reservations, but you can call ahead 30 minutes and they will have your table waiting for you! So far I have had the supper club salad, the fried green tomatoes, gumbo, chowder shrimp and grits and a variety of specials...to be perfectly honest all of them were absolutely delicious! Not one complaint to be said.  If I could afford to eat out every night I would for sure make this place a regular dinner spot!!!
Minus one star for being a little on the pricey side, but everything else pretty much hit the spot. I came here on a Friday night (having called 30 minutes ahead) and we were seated immediately outside. Our waiter was super attentive and friendly. We started off with some shucked raw oysters and a couple drinks. We had one of their special cocktails of the night (can't remember the name of it, but it was delicious) and a Tom Collins (which was about average). Their cornbread starter was AMAZING. Shame we only got two pieces...or maybe not, because I probably would've eaten the entire basket. We got the sliced beef tenderloin and mixed grill. It was my first time trying grits and I wasn't disappointed! The beef and shrimp were also perfectly cooked. Again, the entrees are a bit expensive for my taste but I did have enough leftovers to take home for another meal. I'd definitely come back here for future special events (friends' birthdays, etc). Next time I'll have to remember to get their fried green tomatoes!
Raw bar, enough said. Go there from 4-6pm for half-priced raw bar (doesn't include the shrimp, but it knocks the price down significantly). FYI, the full menu doesn't start til 5pm, but the raw bar and free cornbread with honey-orange butter at the bar will take the edge off your appetite if you have to wait. Their cocktails are great -- I've had the State Street Hurricane (huuuge glass of dark/light rum, lime juice, passionfruit) and the Tipsy Gardener (vodka, St. Germaine's, lemon). My boyfriend and I have been here twice together and have split an entree both times. Portions are very generous and with the raw bar app, drink and cornbread, we usually end up with leftovers from the split entree. The first time here, we tried the blackened catfish creole. It was good and came with a side of beans and rice (just okay) and really good maple collard greens (although I think it varies daily). The second time, we had the shrimp & grits with andouille sausage (which costs extra, but it's so worth it and you should definitely order it). This dish was aaaamazing. Very salty though, so just beware. I'm not sure how the table service is, since we've only eaten at the bar. However, the bartender who served us both times was wonderful and extremely attentive. The bartenders all seem to be pretty good.
We had the raw oysters which were good and jambalaya which was awesome! We will be back
Definitely my favorite for lowkey, romantic dinner. BEST seafood, wine deals, mixed drinks, & music taste in town. Great staff, open late, love this place. Only complaint I have is over-priced crabcakes....I know they're not filler, but come on!
If I could i'd give a separate rating that compares this to the rest of the Ithaca offerings (it would be higher). But because I'm from Chicago I'm comparing it to a broader restaurant scene. I like Maxie's ambiance, especially the bar area. There is a warmth here, especially on a winter evening, that goes along with its comfort food offerings. I like their menu too--my chief complaint however is their appalling use of SALT--every single item is so oversalted that it almost ruins their food! Their shrimp and grits is fantastic but the gravy that comes with is overpoweringly saline. I've tried numerous items and it's always the same. Except for the oysters, which are yummy. I still return though because amongst the Ithaca offerings it's one of the better ones.

Maxie's is hands down my favorite restaurant of all time. Everything about this place is perfect: the building, the service, the decor, the food, the drinks, the music.... I could go on and on. If money isn't an option, I say start with some oysters and fried green tomatoes. As for entrees, it's impossible to choose a favorite but here are my top contenders: gumbo, pulled pork po-boy, and the crab cakes. They serve many local beers so I definitely suggest throwing back a few of Ithaca's finest while you're here. Awwww wish I could go there now....

The atmosphere here is always great.  The service is always friendly, and their cocktail selection is unique and delicious.  My boyfriend insists on ordering the "piggy platter" everytime we come here (a combo of ribs, pulled pork, etc) but I always find myself drawn to something from their daily specials board.  If they ever have the dijon burger, you must try it! The complimentary cornbread at the table is sweet and tasty, and they have a number of appealing apps. Service can be slow from time to time, but it's always worth it!

Shame we only got two pieces...or maybe not, because I probably would've eaten the entire basket. We got the sliced beef tenderloin and mixed grill. It was my first time trying grits and I wasn't disappointed! The beef and shrimp were also perfectly cooked. Again, the entrees are a bit expensive for my taste but I did have enough leftovers to take home for another meal. I'd definitely come back here for future special events (friends' birthdays, etc). Next time I'll have to remember to get their fried green tomatoes!
I've been here a few times and have always left satisfied. I don't usually drink here, but I've done the happy hour oysters and usually had something from their wheelhouse -- jambalaya, etc. The oysters were delicious -- we tried a few from each location being featured that day. My jambalaya was filling and the ingredients really worked well together. I would recommend Maxie's to anyone looking for a solid bit of Southern cooking to fill them up.
Raw bar, enough said. Go there from 4-6pm for half-priced raw bar (doesn't include the shrimp, but it knocks the price down significantly). FYI, the full menu doesn't start til 5pm, but the raw bar and free cornbread with honey-orange butter at the bar will take the edge off your appetite if you have to wait. Their cocktails are great -- I've had the State Street Hurricane (huuuge glass of dark/light rum, lime juice, passionfruit) and the Tipsy Gardener (vodka, St. Germaine's, lemon). My boyfriend and I have been here twice together and have split an entree both times. Portions are very generous and with the raw bar app, drink and cornbread, we usually end up with leftovers from the split entree. The first time here, we tried the blackened catfish creole. It was good and came with a side of beans and rice (just okay) and really good maple collard greens (although I think it varies daily). The second time, we had the shrimp & grits with andouille sausage (which costs extra, but it's so worth it and you should definitely order it). This dish was aaaamazing. Very salty though, so just beware. I'm not sure how the table service is, since we've only eaten at the bar. However, the bartender who served us both times was wonderful and extremely attentive. The bartenders all seem to be pretty good.
I don't often think of Maxie's as a dinner option because I am not a seafood lover but it is one of my husband's favorite places anywhere for this very reason. So we stopped in last night after a long time of not dining here and I have officially changed my tune. Hubby had the raw oysters and shrimp and grits and spent the whole meal on cloud 9. He said the shrimp were cooked to perfection and the sauce on the grits was divine. I had the damn good fish fry and there is no other adjective to describe it. The white fish was coated in the most wonderful batter, like a hush puppy almost and the tartar sauce was the right touch of creamy and salty. I also love any waitress that automatically brings out the malt vinegar to add to the fries. The place was crowded but we got a seat fairly quickly and there was live music playing in the bar. Thankfully, we were weren't in the immediate room so we could enjoy the band but also hear each other speak. Can't wait to go back!
We had the raw oysters which were good and jambalaya which was awesome! We will be back
Loved going for their half price raw oysters and clams.  Also had their peel your own shrimp which was well seasoned.  We will be back when in Ithaca again!
Very good restaurant, good service and good food.  Has a great oyster bar
Definitely my favorite for lowkey, romantic dinner. BEST seafood, wine deals, mixed drinks, & music taste in town. Great staff, open late, love this place. Only complaint I have is over-priced crabcakes....I know they're not filler, but come on!
I imagine all the locals who have been driving around with their Maxie's bumper stickers for a decade now must be gathering a lynch mob as I give this place a mediocre review, but please allow me to explain myself. Historical connotations of the phrase "supper club" aside, Maxie's bills itself as a "fish house and raw bar serving Southern comfort cooking, traditional and modern fresh seafood dishes..." and such. Being from a coastal region of Florida (that's redundant, isn't it?), fish houses and Southern cooking are a couple things I know a bit about. The execution on their dishes is good and on par with what I would expect. The quality is up there and there is a good bit of creativity in the menu. The portions are decent but nothing to write home about. I usually leave hungry. The ingredients are ok, what are you going to expect in terms of fresh seafood in the middle of upstate new york? (for an answer to that question, by the way, I would suggest visiting any Doug's Fish Fry location). I would not compare it to actual gulf coast seafood (or South Carolina seafood, or Maryland seafood, or Boston seafood for that matter), but it is what it is. I'll come back to that in a second.   The dining experience has been to me a pain. They do not take reservations, which I do not understand. This is a huge pet peeve of mine. If you know you are going to be busy every night, which Maxie's is, then why not just get things in order and reward people who have the common decency to use the traditional civilized manner of doing things? Instead they just have a mob on their hands. I suppose they are just trying to make more money by pushing everyone over to their bar while waiting for an eternity. Personally I think that this is not a good way to business if you would like repeat customers. Once you get a table, be prepared to be squeezed into some little niche somewhere, and get ready to scream over the din.       But to me, the restaurant experience is mostly about food. So why only three stars? Because I think that it's not fair to rate a place on location. Let me tell you what I mean by that. Back home I could go to ten places within an hour radius that would serve similar cuisine with much fresher ingredients, larger portions, better ambience, and better service, all at lower prices. Yes Maxie's does a decent job of being a fish house, but the only reason it is so wildly popular is because it's a fish house in Ithaca, New York. So on a straight scale of seafood restaurants, it's a solid three.       Maxie's tries hard, and their recipes are sound. If you are bringing a bunch of born-and-bred northerners up from the City and want to give them something a little different, this is a good place for that. Luck out on timing and you might have a decent service experience. You won't be disappointed in the quality of the food, but, trust me, it doesn't beat the real thing, and I won't be putting a sticker on my car anytime soon. Addendum: Coming clean here, I visited Maxie's again this weekend and had a different and better experience than I had in past visits and initially reported. The principal driver of this was that I arrived quite early and sat in the bar, which was largely uninhabited even through the dinner hour. Service here was much more attentive than in the dining area, strangely enough. I make no changes in my opinion about the food (solid but not amazing), the prices (high), and the portions (average). Looking over to the dining area, it seemed as though the lucky ones who came early were having a fine time, but I will bet that the crowd that was starting to assemble in the foyer around six, as I was leaving, had a different experience.
After dropping my sister off at Ithaca college, my family and I had an amazing dinner at Maxie's.  I highly recommend the crab and corn chowder for an appetizer which had large pieces of crab.  The jambalaya which was nice and spicy was our favorite entree by far.  We even loved the butter that was served with the cornbread which was made with orange juice and honey...delicious.  It was a little loud on Sunday night when they had a band playing so you may want to avoid that if you like it quieter.  Otherwise, the meal was amazing and I will definitely be back.
If I could i'd give a separate rating that compares this to the rest of the Ithaca offerings (it would be higher). But because I'm from Chicago I'm comparing it to a broader restaurant scene. I like Maxie's ambiance, especially the bar area. There is a warmth here, especially on a winter evening, that goes along with its comfort food offerings. I like their menu too--my chief complaint however is their appalling use of SALT--every single item is so oversalted that it almost ruins their food! Their shrimp and grits is fantastic but the gravy that comes with is overpoweringly saline. I've tried numerous items and it's always the same. Except for the oysters, which are yummy. I still return though because amongst the Ithaca offerings it's one of the better ones.
Supper clubs were pre-war rural joints with lazy susans, prime rib specials, and all-night entertainment. They were found mostly in the upper Midwest and served as prohibition roadhouses before the mercy of the 21st amendment. It's hard to know why Maxie's, with its emphasis on southern food and a raw bar, claims to be one. Then again supper clubs and roadhouses were cool and Maxie's wants nothing more than to be that. And for the most part Maxie's delivers; it is cool (albeit in a faintly contrived sort of way), although if it purports to be a supper club it ought to include one American lager on tap and do away with cutesy drink names like "maxie-rita". It's a margarita - just call it that. As for the food, it's good (not great) and there's plenty of it. For an appetizer our table (four of us) ordered the fried green tomatoes (four slices so we each got one), which came with a remoulade. The tomatoes were straight from the fryer and firm but overwhelmed by the breading; not much tomato flavor. The remoulade was Louisiana-style and mayonnaise-based and finely textured, though somewhat bland. For dinner I chose shrimp and grits with tasso sauce and a side of andouille sausage. It's a good thing I was hungry. The grits were thick to begin with, and the addition of the heavy tasso sauce was too much. Plus the portions are huge. Of course I ate the entire thing, but a half order would have been plenty. The sausage was the better part, spicy and smoky with a good char. Cornbread was served with the appetizer and unlike the grits, it's not quite dense enough and crumbles under too much pressure (like so many things). For dessert my fiancee (she insisted and happens to be skinny) and I split the banana chocolate coconut cream pie. Another enormous portion, another study in density. Lots of banana, lots of cream and just plain lots of pie. Our server was excellent as were the hostesses (who provided frequent updates on when our table might be ready, "they've got the check, shouldn't be long now"). Oh and there's live music on Sundays and Tuesdays (in keeping with the supper club tradition).
Maxie's is hands down my favorite restaurant of all time. Everything about this place is perfect: the building, the service, the decor, the food, the drinks, the music.... I could go on and on. If money isn't an option, I say start with some oysters and fried green tomatoes. As for entrees, it's impossible to choose a favorite but here are my top contenders: gumbo, pulled pork po-boy, and the crab cakes. They serve many local beers so I definitely suggest throwing back a few of Ithaca's finest while you're here. Awwww wish I could go there now....
I've been here a few times now, and each time I've confirmed my likes as well as my dislikes (which, I must admit, are relatively few). First off, Maxie's cornbread is tasty. I like it crumbly and moist, not too soggy or too crunchy and this was just right. Never thought I'd appreciate cornbread as much as this. Also, they has delicious pulled pork (I saw, ordered, and conquered the sizable piggy platter...I must say, I had to sit for the next twenty minutes with minimal movement while my stomach got used to the full-to-busting feeling). AMAZING. I think I had tuna and jambalaya here as well. Nothing to complain about. Overall, great portions, friendly service, and there is a decent selection of whiskey/liquor/cocktails On that note, let me just say that Maxie's makes the best Bloody Mary I've ever had. It's especially spicy and not so tomato-y that it is more tomato juice than alcohol. Awesome. I only have a few minor complaints. The one big, bad experience: we made a reservation for a friend's birthday and ended up waiting outside over an hour and a half PAST the reservation time. Of course, we did have a huge group, maybe about 10-12 people? But still. That wait was just ridiculous! I came back though, for the food, and I found the wait wasn't so bad if you come for an extra early or extra late dinner. On the same note, due to overcrowding and the lack of space-allocation, the seating can be pretty cramped, especially if you come in a big groups. They're really accommodating, but still. I'm not a huge girl, but I had to suck in as far as possible while navigating the narrow passage-ways between the tables while avoiding the servers and other patrons trying to claw their way to the bathroom. Finally, the place might be just a tad dark. I mean, it doesn't strike me as a quiet, romantic getaway because there are families and big groups and such, but I guess if you found a corner booth, the darkness could be nice. Otherwise, I wish they'd up the wattage just a little. In conclusion, the prices are decent (glad that there is a range of affordable and slightly pricier), especially when taking into account the portions and the service. Definitely give Maxie's a gander!
The atmosphere here is always great.  The service is always friendly, and their cocktail selection is unique and delicious.  My boyfriend insists on ordering the "piggy platter" everytime we come here (a combo of ribs, pulled pork, etc) but I always find myself drawn to something from their daily specials board.  If they ever have the dijon burger, you must try it! The complimentary cornbread at the table is sweet and tasty, and they have a number of appealing apps. Service can be slow from time to time, but it's always worth it!
I have a love hate relationship with Maxies.  Maxies has been in Ithaca about as long as I have been, and it's probably the restaurant in town that I have eaten at the most.  I've seen them go through various phases and have gone back and forth on considering them one of the best places to eat in town (at one point Maxies was my favorite restaurant), to only an okay place to go just if you're craving oysters.  So my feedback here is somewhat tainted because I compare them not just to other restaurants but to who they used to be. When Maxies first opened their menu was huge.  There were tons of options for both fish eaters, vegetarians, and serious carnivores.  The menu has consistently shrunk unfortunately, to the point where often times I end up only ordered oysters, crab and corn chowder, and maybe an appetizer (I just don't know why every entree has to come with beans and coleslaw).  My husband has even fewer options and only goes there to humor me.  Maxies used to have an additional menu when they had the separate "Tavern at Maxies".  This used to be in the dining room that is closest to the parking lot.  I absolutely loved this menu - no one in town was doing anything like it (various charcuterie/antipasto) and the bonus was that you could still get oysters from the other side.  If I had met my husband while this restaurant was in existence, we would have eaten there once a week until we died.  Anyway, I go into this only to bring up the fact that what I once loved about this restaurant was the variety - now the menu is so watered down it just doesn't have that same draw.   Another loss that I have not yet recovered from is their discontinuation of their Sunday brunch.  They did a fried green tomato BLT that was at the time the best brunch sandwich I had ever had (without enjoying this in a few years it's hard to say that it would beat out the Carriage House ham and cheese sconewich, or the croque madame at Artisan Cafe).  They served fresh beignets and had they seriously had the best bacon ever.  It was either last year or the year before that they announced that brunch would be closed during the college's graduation weekends, and then brunch never returned. I realize that this is an awful review for anyone who wants to eat at Maxies here and now.  Here's where they're at: I consider Maxies expensive.  But it's easy to ring up a good bill at a place that is serving oysters.  I would definitely recommend going during their happy hour (4-6pm daily, though the full menu is not available until 5), for the 1/2 price raw bar items if you're into the oyster thing.  Don't expect the happy hour to put a huge dent in the check though, because drinks are expensive and so is most the food.  I'm always happy to pay more for better food, but Maxies doesn't exactly nail the "better food" category like they used to (again, I'm living in the past, but they used to have one of the greatest filet entrees in town.  the meat they serve currently is not nearly as tender or as flavorful).   Service is largely good.  Some servers have been there for at least 6 or 7 years and they know everything inside and out.  Sometimes little things about the service bug me, but it's not a fancy place so this laid-back deal is just what they're all about I guess.   And of course the food.  Food is good, not great.  The complimentary cornbread is fantastic and I will always love their chowder.  I can't say that I have eaten anything else there that was particularly memorable in a very long time though.  I usually order a special and I think that the specials are pretty consistently far better than the rest of their fare.  I like the desserts - their chocolate cake is perfect chocolate cake in my book, love the key lime pie.  The banana chocolate cream pis is actually my favorite, but this particular dessert is pretty inconsistent.  Sometimes it's all chocolate, sometimes all bananas (and sometimes the bananas are super ripe, sometimes green).  Great (but expensive) bar drinks.   I wouldn't use their bathroom if you're clausterphobic, I would never go there on a Friday or Saturday night if you wanted to be able to hear the people that you're with, I would never go to the Sunday night free music if I didn't know the band, I would never take a non-fish eater here if they didn't see the menu ahead of time and see something they knew they could order. but I would order a hurricane, bring some oyster loving friends after work, chomp a few desserts, and ask for some mardi gras beads just for fun.
I've been here a few times and have always left satisfied. I don't usually drink here, but I've done the happy hour oysters and usually had something from their wheelhouse -- jambalaya, etc. The oysters were delicious -- we tried a few from each location being featured that day. My jambalaya was filling and the ingredients really worked well together. I would recommend Maxie's to anyone looking for a solid bit of Southern cooking to fill them up.
Even down here in New York I still have cravings for Maxie's. What a fun place! Especially great when there's live music. I love their Fried Oyster Po'Boy with remoullade. Ithaca's own little taste of Nawlins. Is this the best restaurant in Ithaca? Possibly.
I don't often think of Maxie's as a dinner option because I am not a seafood lover but it is one of my husband's favorite places anywhere for this very reason. So we stopped in last night after a long time of not dining here and I have officially changed my tune. Hubby had the raw oysters and shrimp and grits and spent the whole meal on cloud 9.

Thankfully, we were weren't in the immediate room so we could enjoy the band but also hear each other speak. Can't wait to go back!
Okay, it's probably well past time that I review Maxie's, considering I've been here dozens of times in the past two years. Maxie's is as consistent, and as consistently good, as you will find in Ithaca, if not most places. The service is always exemplary. The couple times they messed up a drink or a dish they offered a new one and took the original off the bill or gave us an appetizer for free. During the weekend the wait can be long, but they are honest at giving you accurate wait times and you can order and eat at the bar if you so choose. Go during the week for a more relaxed, quieter atmosphere. The happy hour, from 4-6 everyday, is worth checking out, at least. It tends to get somewhat insanely packed, but if you're in the mood for fresh oysters, clams and shrimp it's well worth it, as they're half price. The oysters are delicious, super fresh, a rarity for seafood in Ithaca. One nitpick I have is I have found bits of shell in them when they were super crowded for happy hour, but since it's only happened once I'll let it go. Other than the oysters, here are some other picks: GREAT: Cajun popcorn - lightly fried, hot, slightly spicy seasoning blend, like crawfish butter in your mouth with a little lemon Cornbread - light, airy, flakey, mmm Shrimp and grits - buttery grits with shrimp in a slightly spicy sauce, best with the Andouille sausage and as a half order, unless you're starving Blackened catfish or catfish po' boy - both stellar, light, fresh fish choices cooked to a blackened cajun, with a little spice. Go with the po' boy unless you're craving vegetables. Cajun fries - same cajun spices as above served on fries - ask them to make them extra crisp. Jambayala - huge, slightly spicy mix of seafood, sausage and chicken, CAUTION enough to eat on for a work week - the vegetarian jambalaya is also a good pick if you're not feeling like eating all of Noah's ark in one dish Pecan pie - a just sweet enough, crispy enough, buttery enough pecan pie that is unfortunately only seldom offered. GOOD: Gumbo - Not quite up to New Orlean's finest, but still well spiced with a nice tang. Go for the appetizer option and a mini plate or a smaller main course. Crab chowder - good, but doesn't meet what you can get in the NYC metro. Unless you're craving chowder - which sometimes I am - the gumbo above is a better pick. Chicken fried chicken - I have friends who swear by it - fried with a good amount of batter, white meat with great seasoning. Sometimes a bit bony for my taste, but I could just have bad luck. Ribs/pulled pork - both seasoned well and ample portions, with great cajun fries, but a bit too dry for my taste. If you like dry barbeque you may like this better. Portabella po' boy - Some vegetarian friends love it - spiced like the Blackened Catfish mentioned above. I like mushrooms, but I can't get excited for them as my whole meal. Crabcake - good, well, seasoned, large chunks of crab, but not quite enough to make it in Maryland or Delware MEH: Fish tacos - didn't have the accoutrements to add a lot of flavor and the fish was a bit under spiced for me. Mahi-mahi - not bad, but a bit too little flavor, especially compared to the catfish. Rock shrimp - these were 1/3 shrimp, 2/3 batter. I really felt like batter was being pored down my gullet.
Loved going for their half price raw oysters and clams.  Also had their peel your own shrimp which was well seasoned.  We will be back when in Ithaca again!
$34 for a dozen oysters. Menu said Market Price, but damn.  Food was very good, but not enough to fill the huge empty spot when the check came.
Very good restaurant, good service and good food.  Has a great oyster bar
I had a great time at Maxie's! The ambiance is really great and the music wasn't too loud. I wish there was a live band playing, it just looked like there should have been one. The staff all around was helpful and friendly; Waiter recommended drinks with a reason, and staff nearby said hi and bye. The major downfall that struck and surprised me was that I really didn't care for their Jambalaya. The salad was great and so was the cornbread, but the Jambalaya was fairly dry and I wasn't expecting that. But maybe it's just their style. Had the dish been better I would say 5 stars.
I imagine all the locals who have been driving around with their Maxie's bumper stickers for a decade now must be gathering a lynch mob as I give this place a mediocre review, but please allow me to explain myself. Historical connotations of the phrase "supper club" aside, Maxie's bills itself as a "fish house and raw bar serving Southern comfort cooking, traditional and modern fresh seafood dishes..." and such. Being from a coastal region of Florida (that's redundant, isn't it?), fish houses and Southern cooking are a couple things I know a bit about.

I have wanted to write a review for Maxie's for quite some time now, but wanted to be critically fair in my assessment so I waited.  I visited Maxie's 2 years ago the night after I came home from NYC where I had some of the most marvelous cullinary dishes.  That being said, I had the fried green tomatoes, blackened catfish which came with rice.  My husband had the crab cakes with the red white and blue slaw served with sweet potato fries.  The fried green tomatoes were over cooked hard as rocks really and inedible.  The catfish was dry and unfortunately had sat under the heating lamp too long as they brought the entrees before we had hacked our way through one fried green tomato. The rice tasted like uncle ben's. The crab cakes were also over done instead of golden brown they were dark as if they had been fried in old grease.  Aside from the dab of romoulade on top were lacking any flavor.  The up side to the disasterous meal was the 10$ off a bottle of wine special they run on Monday nights. But expect them to rush you out the door before you have had time to relax and enjoy it.  That was 2 years ago!   Last night 2/16 2011 I decided perhaps it was just a fluke, one bad experience, I had just come from a city where they make some of the best food in the world.... So I decided to give Maxie's another try.  The drinks were as usual, expensive but delicious.  I had the crab cakes, big mistake.  Same as before hard, overdone and lacking in flavor.  The sweet potato fries which covered most of my $20 platter had this strange seasoning and to me were inedible. Our server stated that it is the one thing that they buy that is frozen.   I don't know what ever attracted me to this place.  15 years ago I thought it was great, but I think that at that time that was the high point in my dining experience. My palate has become more refined andI have had many many other wonderful food experiences that  this place just doesn't do it for me.  Too much hype for so little.  If I had spent 2 dollars more I could have gotten a really wonderful meal at the Fine Line on state street.  I will not return to Maxie's.
After dropping my sister off at Ithaca college, my family and I had an amazing dinner at Maxie's.  I highly recommend the crab and corn chowder for an appetizer which had large pieces of crab.  The jambalaya which was nice and spicy was our favorite entree by far.  We even loved the butter that was served with the cornbread which was made with orange juice and honey...delicious.  It was a little loud on Sunday night when they had a band playing so you may want to avoid that if you like it quieter.  Otherwise, the meal was amazing and I will definitely be back.
Yes this place is very good.  The portions here are huge, so portion control is very hard, but why control in such a delicious place?  I really like their oyster bar, it is so delicious.  I recommend going during happy hour because oysters tend to be expensive.

fantasmic eggs benedict. excellent service. the keys to a great restaurant. imho.
I've been here a few times now, and each time I've confirmed my likes as well as my dislikes (which, I must admit, are relatively few). First off, Maxie's cornbread is tasty. I like it crumbly and moist, not too soggy or too crunchy and this was just right. Never thought I'd appreciate cornbread as much as this. Also, they has delicious pulled pork (I saw, ordered, and conquered the sizable piggy platter...I must say, I had to sit for the next twenty minutes with minimal movement while my stomach got used to the full-to-busting feeling). AMAZING. I think I had tuna and jambalaya here as well. Nothing to complain about. Overall, great portions, friendly service, and there is a decent selection of whiskey/liquor/cocktails On that note, let me just say that Maxie's makes the best Bloody Mary I've ever had. It's especially spicy and not so tomato-y that it is more tomato juice than alcohol. Awesome. I only have a few minor complaints. The one big, bad experience: we made a reservation for a friend's birthday and ended up waiting outside over an hour and a half PAST the reservation time. Of course, we did have a huge group, maybe about 10-12 people? But still. That wait was just ridiculous! I came back though, for the food, and I found the wait wasn't so bad if you come for an extra early or extra late dinner. On the same note, due to overcrowding and the lack of space-allocation, the seating can be pretty cramped, especially if you come in a big groups. They're really accommodating, but still. I'm not a huge girl, but I had to suck in as far as possible while navigating the narrow passage-ways between the tables while avoiding the servers and other patrons trying to claw their way to the bathroom. Finally, the place might be just a tad dark. I mean, it doesn't strike me as a quiet, romantic getaway because there are families and big groups and such, but I guess if you found a corner booth, the darkness could be nice. Otherwise, I wish they'd up the wattage just a little. In conclusion, the prices are decent (glad that there is a range of affordable and slightly pricier), especially when taking into account the portions and the service. Definitely give Maxie's a gander!
While not a place that I go to a lot, Maxie's hits the spot about once a year. Sit on the deck(next to the parking lot), have a taste of some Cajun and go home full. Jambalaya with their homemade cornbread is a winner. They usually have several types of oysters to pick from and people rave about the crab cakes. Pleasant service in a casual setting, Maxie's never disappoints.
I have a love hate relationship with Maxies.  Maxies has been in Ithaca about as long as I have been, and it's probably the restaurant in town that I have eaten at the most.  I've seen them go through various phases and have gone back and forth on considering them one of the best places to eat in town (at one point Maxies was my favorite restaurant), to only an okay place to go just if you're craving oysters.  So my feedback here is somewhat tainted because I compare them not just to other restaurants but to who they used to be. When Maxies first opened their menu was huge.  There were tons of options for both fish eaters, vegetarians, and serious carnivores.  The menu has consistently shrunk unfortunately, to the point where often times I end up only ordered oysters, crab and corn chowder, and maybe an appetizer (I just don't know why every entree has to come with beans and coleslaw).  My husband has even fewer options and only goes there to humor me.  Maxies used to have an additional menu when they had the separate "Tavern at Maxies".  This used to be in the dining room that is closest to the parking lot.  I absolutely loved this menu - no one in town was doing anything like it (various charcuterie/antipasto) and the bonus was that you could still get oysters from the other side.  If I had met my husband while this restaurant was in existence, we would have eaten there once a week until we died.  Anyway, I go into this only to bring up the fact that what I once loved about this restaurant was the variety - now the menu is so watered down it just doesn't have that same draw.   Another loss that I have not yet recovered from is their discontinuation of their Sunday brunch.  They did a fried green tomato BLT that was at the time the best brunch sandwich I had ever had (without enjoying this in a few years it's hard to say that it would beat out the Carriage House ham and cheese sconewich, or the croque madame at Artisan Cafe).  They served fresh beignets and had they seriously had the best bacon ever.  It was either last year or the year before that they announced that brunch would be closed during the college's graduation weekends, and then brunch never returned. I realize that this is an awful review for anyone who wants to eat at Maxies here and now.  Here's where they're at: I consider Maxies expensive.  But it's easy to ring up a good bill at a place that is serving oysters.  I would definitely recommend going during their happy hour (4-6pm daily, though the full menu is not available until 5), for the 1/2 price raw bar items if you're into the oyster thing.  Don't expect the happy hour to put a huge dent in the check though, because drinks are expensive and so is most the food.  I'm always happy to pay more for better food, but Maxies doesn't exactly nail the "better food" category like they used to (again, I'm living in the past, but they used to have one of the greatest filet entrees in town.  the meat they serve currently is not nearly as tender or as flavorful).   Service is largely good.  Some servers have been there for at least 6 or 7 years and they know everything inside and out.  Sometimes little things about the service bug me, but it's not a fancy place so this laid-back deal is just what they're all about I guess.   And of course the food.  Food is good, not great.  The complimentary cornbread is fantastic and I will always love their chowder.  I can't say that I have eaten anything else there that was particularly memorable in a very long time though.  I usually order a special and I think that the specials are pretty consistently far better than the rest of their fare.  I like the desserts - their chocolate cake is perfect chocolate cake in my book, love the key lime pie.  The banana chocolate cream pis is actually my favorite, but this particular dessert is pretty inconsistent.  Sometimes it's all chocolate, sometimes all bananas (and sometimes the bananas are super ripe, sometimes green).  Great (but expensive) bar drinks.   I wouldn't use their bathroom if you're clausterphobic, I would never go there on a Friday or Saturday night if you wanted to be able to hear the people that you're with, I would never go to the Sunday night free music if I didn't know the band, I would never take a non-fish eater here if they didn't see the menu ahead of time and see something they knew they could order. but I would order a hurricane, bring some oyster loving friends after work, chomp a few desserts, and ask for some mardi gras beads just for fun.
Aggressively mediocre food though I liked the vibe. The cornbread was cold. The crab and corn chowder was thin. The jambalaya was dry and somewhat flavorless. Good place for drinks, Mondays are $10 off a bottle of wine, but I wouldn't eat there.
Even down here in New York I still have cravings for Maxie's. What a fun place! Especially great when there's live music. I love their Fried Oyster Po'Boy with remoullade. Ithaca's own little taste of Nawlins. Is this the best restaurant in Ithaca? Possibly.
I went there for lunch they offer a lot of daily specials on the menu. Their customer service is very helpful in deciding what to order of their delicious menu. I love their sweet potato fries and they set mood with really cool music. The only down side is they are right on a busy street so you can here the traffic when your trying to relax.
Okay, it's probably well past time that I review Maxie's, considering I've been here dozens of times in the past two years. Maxie's is as consistent, and as consistently good, as you will find in Ithaca, if not most places. The service is always exemplary. The couple times they messed up a drink or a dish they offered a new one and took the original off the bill or gave us an appetizer for free. During the weekend the wait can be long, but they are honest at giving you accurate wait times and you can order and eat at the bar if you so choose. Go during the week for a more relaxed, quieter atmosphere. The happy hour, from 4-6 everyday, is worth checking out, at least. It tends to get somewhat insanely packed, but if you're in the mood for fresh oysters, clams and shrimp it's well worth it, as they're half price. The oysters are delicious, super fresh, a rarity for seafood in Ithaca. One nitpick I have is I have found bits of shell in them when they were super crowded for happy hour, but since it's only happened once I'll let it go. Other than the oysters, here are some other picks: GREAT: Cajun popcorn - lightly fried, hot, slightly spicy seasoning blend, like crawfish butter in your mouth with a little lemon Cornbread - light, airy, flakey, mmm Shrimp and grits - buttery grits with shrimp in a slightly spicy sauce, best with the Andouille sausage and as a half order, unless you're starving Blackened catfish or catfish po' boy - both stellar, light, fresh fish choices cooked to a blackened cajun, with a little spice. Go with the po' boy unless you're craving vegetables. Cajun fries - same cajun spices as above served on fries - ask them to make them extra crisp. Jambayala - huge, slightly spicy mix of seafood, sausage and chicken, CAUTION enough to eat on for a work week - the vegetarian jambalaya is also a good pick if you're not feeling like eating all of Noah's ark in one dish Pecan pie - a just sweet enough, crispy enough, buttery enough pecan pie that is unfortunately only seldom offered. GOOD: Gumbo - Not quite up to New Orlean's finest, but still well spiced with a nice tang. Go for the appetizer option and a mini plate or a smaller main course. Crab chowder - good, but doesn't meet what you can get in the NYC metro. Unless you're craving chowder - which sometimes I am - the gumbo above is a better pick. Chicken fried chicken - I have friends who swear by it - fried with a good amount of batter, white meat with great seasoning. Sometimes a bit bony for my taste, but I could just have bad luck. Ribs/pulled pork - both seasoned well and ample portions, with great cajun fries, but a bit too dry for my taste. If you like dry barbeque you may like this better. Portabella po' boy - Some vegetarian friends love it - spiced like the Blackened Catfish mentioned above. I like mushrooms, but I can't get excited for them as my whole meal. Crabcake - good, well, seasoned, large chunks of crab, but not quite enough to make it in Maryland or Delware MEH: Fish tacos - didn't have the accoutrements to add a lot of flavor and the fish was a bit under spiced for me. Mahi-mahi - not bad, but a bit too little flavor, especially compared to the catfish. Rock shrimp - these were 1/3 shrimp, 2/3 batter. I really felt like batter was being pored down my gullet.
I've been sick after eating at Maxie's more often than I care to think about.  The last time, I had a bad feeling about the temperature of the food I was eating while I was eating it -- it was not hot when it should have been.  Sure enough, I was sick from that meal.  My husband reminded me that I have been sick following dinner at Maxie's several times in the last year or so, so it's *off* our list of places that we'll go.  Too bad since we've been loyal customers for more than a decade.   The last time we went, newer staff members have been less than pleasant.   The hostess was curt and there was no reason for it.  The restaurant was half-empty and we did not want to sit at a table in a very high-traffic zone.  She responded by being quite rude.  I was a hostess (and a waitress) putting myself through college and being rude to someone who prefers not to be seated at the worst table should never be met with a bad attitude.  Some tables are hard to seat and that's just the way it is bc they are less desirable.  I'm not going to pay 50.00 for a simple dinner for two of sandwiches while sitting at a super-crappy table where we'll get bumped by every person trying to squeeze by.
$34 for a dozen oysters. Menu said Market Price, but damn.  Food was very good, but not enough to fill the huge empty spot when the check came.
I had a great time at Maxie's! The ambiance is really great and the music wasn't too loud. I wish there was a live band playing, it just looked like there should have been one. The staff all around was helpful and friendly; Waiter recommended drinks with a reason, and staff nearby said hi and bye. The major downfall that struck and surprised me was that I really didn't care for their Jambalaya. The salad was great and so was the cornbread, but the Jambalaya was fairly dry and I wasn't expecting that. But maybe it's just their style. Had the dish been better I would say 5 stars.
Overpriced Southern food.   Come here only because nowhere else in Ithaca can satisfy your Cajun craving, or because it's Tuesday and you want their Fried Chicken special.
It's unfortunate that during my two years in Ithaca I only visited Maxie's once. The fried green tomatoes and crab cakes were awesome. Sitting outside on the patio during a warm, humid day wasn't as great, but someone had to do it!
I have wanted to write a review for Maxie's for quite some time now, but wanted to be critically fair in my assessment so I waited.  I visited Maxie's 2 years ago the night after I came home from NYC where I had some of the most marvelous cullinary dishes.  That being said, I had the fried green tomatoes, blackened catfish which came with rice.  My husband had the crab cakes with the red white and blue slaw served with sweet potato fries.  The fried green tomatoes were over cooked hard as rocks really and inedible.  The catfish was dry and unfortunately had sat under the heating lamp too long as they brought the entrees before we had hacked our way through one fried green tomato. The rice tasted like uncle ben's. The crab cakes were also over done instead of golden brown they were dark as if they had been fried in old grease.  Aside from the dab of romoulade on top were lacking any flavor.  The up side to the disasterous meal was the 10$ off a bottle of wine special they run on Monday nights. But expect them to rush you out the door before you have had time to relax and enjoy it.  That was 2 years ago!   Last night 2/16 2011 I decided perhaps it was just a fluke, one bad experience, I had just come from a city where they make some of the best food in the world.... So I decided to give Maxie's another try.  The drinks were as usual, expensive but delicious.  I had the crab cakes, big mistake.  Same as before hard, overdone and lacking in flavor.  The sweet potato fries which covered most of my $20 platter had this strange seasoning and to me were inedible. Our server stated that it is the one thing that they buy that is frozen.   I don't know what ever attracted me to this place.  15 years ago I thought it was great, but I think that at that time that was the high point in my dining experience. My palate has become more refined andI have had many many other wonderful food experiences that  this place just doesn't do it for me.  Too much hype for so little.  If I had spent 2 dollars more I could have gotten a really wonderful meal at the Fine Line on state street.  I will not return to Maxie's.
Way too loud. Way too much seafood (not enough non seafood). Food was less than mediocre. Prices seemed reasonable IF the food was better and the radio turned down. I will not be going back.
Yes this place is very good.  The portions here are huge, so portion control is very hard, but why control in such a delicious place?  I really like their oyster bar, it is so delicious.  I recommend going during happy hour because oysters tend to be expensive.
Great food, great draught beer selection, friendly staff, but my favorite is the freshly-shucked raw oysters. Gotta love half price oysters 4-6 daily.
fantasmic eggs benedict. excellent service. the keys to a great restaurant. imho.
Decent food and service, festive vibe. Crab and corn chowder, fried green tomatoes, shrimp and grits were all good. I'd come back if I was craving LA food.

I came with high expectations. I ordered the Vegetable Jambalaya and it was basically tomato sauce on rice with some beans, tofu and green. No vegan options for dessert and nothing fabulous for a starter. The service was good though but my meal was not.

Do you like fried food? Yes?! Well then, you'll love Maxie's Supper Club... Our meal began with Fried Green Tomatoes. I tasted the fried, not so much the green tomatoes. Then we each ordered something different - a portobello burger (average), pulled pork sandwich (a little heavy on the pork... the side of beans even had pork drifting around in it), and ahi tuna (good, but the hush puppy was, of course, fried)... Sunday nights there is live music - this past Sunday the band sounded kind of like Counting Crows, but not really. It's a fun atmosphere :)

One of my favorite restaurants in Ithaca.  You must not miss the Banana Chocolate Coconut Cream Pie with bananas, pastry cream, chocolate, whipped cream, toasted coconut.  I went there two out of my four years at Cornell for my birthday dinner.

Ho and Hum....this place is a snore of a dining experience. Granted, we were there on a busy Friday night without reservations. The hostesses were gracious and found us a tight little table in the main "house" that was dark enough to show movies. Perhaps that contributed to my less than stellar choice of menu items. I ordered the ribs that my waiter swore were moist and tender. They arrived atop my cole slaw (now warm and mushy) and next to baked beans with pulled pork which was actually the best thing on the plate. The ribs were the opposite of tender. They had a tough, leathery crust that tasted like the grill and were also strangely cut with "mystery" bones that usually do not appear in most ribs. The interior is funky, the service relatively attentive, but I would not return based on my first experience. And when it comes to the success of a restaurant aren't first impressions everything?
Mmmm - red velvet on the walls, free live music, and Shirley Temples listed on the menu - such a slice of heaven. I could fill myself up on the cornbread and sweet butter alone, but I'm sure that is not healthy and there is too much to try on the menu. If you go with two or more people, you could get away with ordering one less plate than person to share, since the meals are pretty big and filling. The jambalya has a good kick to it and the pulled pork plate is very satisfying - plus it comes with more cornbread!

I really only ate one thing here, the fried chicken po boy, and it was perfect. They have super tasty seasoned fries and sweet potato fries. I once tried their pulled pork BBQ sandwich, but it was only average. Go for the fried things, they will never let you down. Oh yes, and they have a raw oyster bar, and supposedly very good tuna, etc. I wouldn't know because I don't like seafood--especially fresh seafood, unless it came battered and fried and half drowned in malt vinegar. The bar is ok--they usually have a few good beers on tap, but other than that, I wouldn't expect anything exceptional. On weekends they are ridiculously busy, with an hour or more wait at times. I'm not sure I'd be willing to the fight the crowd on those nights, but they also have take-out if you want to retreat to the safety of your own home.

This isn't the only restaurant I've visited in Ithaca, but it's the only one I remember. One word: mmmmmmmm. We started off with corn bread -- delicious despite being cold (I just prefer it warm). The crabcake(s), available in appetizer or entree form, are to die for. To kill for? At least to maim for. Flakey not cakey! Mouth-melting, truly. Get 'em. I had the veggie jambalaya (trying to limit the caloric damage), which was really good, if a bit dry. It came with spinach, tofu and pecans and was very tasty. Boyfriend got shrimp 'n' grits 'n' I had some the next morning for breakfast. Yum. The only thing to warn against is the so-called peach cobbler, obviously made with canned peaches and no crust in sight. Huh? Our waiter was really nice and funny, though. This is a nice casual spot with purple walls (befitting a college town, I guess) and live music. A sweet spot.
Food is very good but it's Ithaca so the service is very slow. Dinner for eight took over two hours. They make a mean cocktail.
The second-best restaurant in Ithaca, hands down (behind BlueStone, of course).  You can enjoy delicious seafood and oysters, or stick with something with a Southern spice to it.  Just don't think you're going to get a table on Friday or Saturday night without a wait -- everyone knows how good this place is.
We just moved here this year from North Carolina... so I've been craving some good ole southern food, and Maxie's delivered!!! Best crab cake I've had away from the ocean, and the pulled pork was pretty spot on too (though the slaw was lacking a bit) The cajun fries were pretty much deep fried heaven. We'll be back... often.
Stopped in because I heard about the live music on Tuesdays, and was really excited to see the cajun inspired menu and drinks. Food was delicious and the drinks were great. I'll definitely be back to explore the rest of the menu.
Great place for dinner! We lucked out, got the last 2 seat table in the place w/out a reservation. Crab cakes were VERY good, not at all greasy, mostly flaked meat but some nice chunks of lump. Yellow grits were VERY good too, had a mild curry sauce on top that was delicious! A bit loud, practically had to shout over the din for my dining partner to hear me but I guess you can expect that in a place that features southern cooking.
Great service! The staff clearly work as a team and that's so refreshing to see. The Cajun fries are sinfully delicious and I have yet to be disappointed by a menu item.
Good oyster, green tomatos, and fried chicken. Free corn bread was a delicious bonus. Nice atmosphere too.
Excellent everything!

I have been going to Maxie's since it opened while in the Ithaca area visiting family.  I haven't been there in a few years and finally got to go back this Feb.  I remembered why I always enjoyed going there.  The food is delicious.  It brings back memories of my trips to New Orleans.  The staff is friendly and the food is consistent.  If you go in winter when it is really cold out make sure you dress warm.  They have added curtains to try to keep the heat in and the cold out but it isn't always successful.  This wouldn't stop me from going to Maxie's though.  The food is worth the cold.

I don't know why this business is listed as $$, I definitely think it hits the $$$ range, but I am pretty cheap. That said, it is a really nice place and everything I have had is great. I had the fried green tomatoes (yum) and fried chicken (double yum). Other people I went with tried the seafood and had good things to say. I think it is easily one of the best restaurants in Ithaca, but again, more of a place to go with your parents than say, just with friends on a random weekend. I don't think you could get away with spending less than 35 dollars for two, and if you have drinks then certainly not.
Great southern food and decent drinks.  Free cornbread is amazing! Portions are a bit large, I usually expect to take home leftovers when I go there. Only had one bad experience when I tried their Jambalaya and was unimpressed.  On other occasions I tried their Shrimp & Grits and their Gumbo, which were amazing!

Maxies is my favorite place in ithaca.  The BBQ Tofu Sandwich is amazing!!
I've only been to Maxie's one time, but we had a wonderful experience.  The food was fantastic - I had fried chicken, mashed potatoes with tasso gravy, and maple-braised collard greens.  The greens were some of the best I've ever tasted and everything else was excellent, too.  My friend had fish and chips - also very good (We both LOVED the tartar sauce). The black currant iced tea was delicious! The complimentary cornbread was a nice touch. Our meals arrived quickly and our server was very attentive.  We ate dinner late so didn't have to wait for a table, but the dining room isn't very big, so I can see that this place probably fills up quickly - I recommend calling ahead for a table.

Maxie's is a gem on the west end of town. A true taste of New Orleans located in upstate ny. My friend brought me here the first time & introduced me to their raw oyster bar. Not only to they shuck them right in front of you but the bartenders are very educated in the oyster field. The atmosphere is very cozy and very New Orleans. If you get there on a Tuesday you have to try the chicken fried chicken. The only downfall I would say is the narrowness of the bar it can get kind of Cramped in there. maxis has slowly become one of my favorite restaurants in Ithaca

I must admit, some of my guilty pleasures include soul food, creole, and southern food. I went to Maxie's with my GF and her family on a weekend evening.  It was really busy but the waiters were really on their game.  Our waitress very enthusiastically told us about the specials and answered all of our questions about the menu. I started off with the gumbo.  It was a pretty decent gumbo.  I was assured that the gumbo would be very spicy.  It is not.  It packs a little bit of heat, but I wouldn't call it overly spicy.  For a place that specializes in creole cooking, this was pretty mediocre gumbo.  I wasn't brave enough to have the oysters because being in central NY, I had serious reservations about how fresh they would be. I ordered the blackened catfish po-boy for dinner.  It was incredible.  The catfish was a little spicy, juicy, and not overly salty.  The french bread that it was served on was also very nice.  The cajun fries also complimented the sandwich perfectly.  I would highly recommend their po boy sandwiches. Overall, I would highly recommend Maxie's.  If you don't have a soft spot for creole cooking, I would knock a star off of my review.
Great place for dinner! We lucked out, got the last 2 seat table in the place w/out a reservation. Crab cakes were VERY good, not at all greasy, mostly flaked meat but some nice chunks of lump. Yellow grits were VERY good too, had a mild curry sauce on top that was delicious! A bit loud, practically had to shout over the din for my dining partner to hear me but I guess you can expect that in a place that features southern cooking.
Can't go wrong with anything on this menu. Never have had a bad time at this place. Great food, great help, and great atmosphere.
Great service! The staff clearly work as a team and that's so refreshing to see. The Cajun fries are sinfully delicious and I have yet to be disappointed by a menu item.
hey it is a bar! it is fun. food is soso. what else shall i say.
Good oyster, green tomatos, and fried chicken. Free corn bread was a delicious bonus. Nice atmosphere too.
My husband, in-laws & I debated between 4 an 5 stars for much of this meal. The restaurant was pretty busy, but the service was excellent. Our waiter was super friendly and accommodating. The highlights for me were the raw oysters, grits & shrimp (appetizer), catfish plate, and espresso-infused crème brûlée (dessert special, so delicious). My only qualm was that two of the cocktails we ordered were a bit weak (the bloody mary & the white whiskey sour), but the next two drinks (dirty martini and a maker's mark mint julep) were knockouts. Basically, avoid ordering cocktails with ice cubes. The beer on tap was great - tried the Ithaca Brewery's Flower Power IPA, which was excellent!
Excellent everything!
My experience with Maxie's was usually restricted to appetizers (like the cajun popcorn (YUM!) and the peel-n-eat shrimp (YUM!)) and to the po' boys (portebello and crab cake are delicious). The atmosphere was always lively and fun. Its a good restaurant for groups and crowds, as it is fun and noisy.
I have been going to Maxie's since it opened while in the Ithaca area visiting family.  I haven't been there in a few years and finally got to go back this Feb.  I remembered why I always enjoyed going there.  The food is delicious.  It brings back memories of my trips to New Orleans.  The staff is friendly and the food is consistent.  If you go in winter when it is really cold out make sure you dress warm.  They have added curtains to try to keep the heat in and the cold out but it isn't always successful.  This wouldn't stop me from going to Maxie's though.  The food is worth the cold.
This is one of the restaurants I always recommend to visitors and friends.  Great food, fun atmosphere, excellent drinks, and live music Sunday and Tuesday nights!  Its the full package - fish specials are ALWAYS excellent.
I don't know why this business is listed as $$, I definitely think it hits the $$$ range, but I am pretty cheap. That said, it is a really nice place and everything I have had is great. I had the fried green tomatoes (yum) and fried chicken (double yum). Other people I went with tried the seafood and had good things to say. I think it is easily one of the best restaurants in Ithaca, but again, more of a place to go with your parents than say, just with friends on a random weekend. I don't think you could get away with spending less than 35 dollars for two, and if you have drinks then certainly not.
I come here for oyster shooters, crab cakes and red white and blue cole slaw.  :)
Great southern food and decent drinks.  Free cornbread is amazing! Portions are a bit large, I usually expect to take home leftovers when I go there. Only had one bad experience when I tried their Jambalaya and was unimpressed.  On other occasions I tried their Shrimp & Grits and their Gumbo, which were amazing!
I like the food and atmosphere of Maxie's a lot. Though I haven't had any seafood, I recommend the chicken and the pulled pork! The food is reasonably priced for what you get, and though the building is not very kid friendly, the staff certainly is. My main gripe about Maxie's is the building itself. Yes, it has a lot of character, but I find it to be very cramped and I'm nearly always cold. I try to remember to wear a good sweater and scarf, but I am forgetful, so going to Maxie's anytime it's less than 50 degrees pretty much guarantees I'm going to have to wear my jacket the whole meal.
Maxies is my favorite place in ithaca.  The BBQ Tofu Sandwich is amazing!!
If you want the best food, atmosphere and service in Ithaca, NY... Get to Maxies!
I've only been to Maxie's one time, but we had a wonderful experience.  The food was fantastic - I had fried chicken, mashed potatoes with tasso gravy, and maple-braised collard greens.  The greens were some of the best I've ever tasted and everything else was excellent, too.  My friend had fish and chips - also very good (We both LOVED the tartar sauce). The black currant iced tea was delicious! The complimentary cornbread was a nice touch. Our meals arrived quickly and our server was very attentive.  We ate dinner late so didn't have to wait for a table, but the dining room isn't very big, so I can see that this place probably fills up quickly - I recommend calling ahead for a table.
This was the first restaurant I ever ate at in Ithaca and it is still one of my favorites. Wonderful ambiance, and it's nice when you can sit outside in the summer. The food is amazing, as are the hot cornbread pieces that they always give you while you are waiting. Love the live music too!  Five stars, all the way.
Maxie's is a gem on the west end of town. A true taste of New Orleans located in upstate ny. My friend brought me here the first time & introduced me to their raw oyster bar. Not only to they shuck them right in front of you but the bartenders are very educated in the oyster field. The atmosphere is very cozy and very New Orleans. If you get there on a Tuesday you have to try the chicken fried chicken. The only downfall I would say is the narrowness of the bar it can get kind of Cramped in there. maxis has slowly become one of my favorite restaurants in Ithaca
I had not been in a while. I went the other day and found the jambalaya tasted reheated at best.
Great place with quality seafood and a REAL Oyster Bar.Great drink specials and Southern style food. A must eat place if you are in Ithaca. Friendly servers and a great menu.

Awesome oyster po boy, gumbo, bloody mary's....and live music!
hey it is a bar! it is fun. food is soso. what else shall i say.
My wife and I are regulars. The food is amazing but I'm little disappointed that they've reduced the size of their portions recently.

amazing. i was in ithaca for a charity event and visiting all the places my mom and aunt remember from being raised there. we celebrated by going to maxie's and it was SO GOOD. the service was great- staff is friendly and helpful and witty. i tried everything on our table... pulled pork, beans, cornbread, cod, haddock, sp fries, crab and corn chowder-- everything was superb! drinks were great too! the atmosphere is fun. they had live music near the bar and outdoor seating under a canopy. the place it small but it adds to the personality.

Same as my last meal there four years ago, excellent. Bartenders were informed and made great martinis with local gin. Seated outside. Incredible buffalo calamari, my daughter enjoyed the crab cakes and I loved the fried chicken (add a dark meat option) with the mashed potatoes and crazy good tasso sauce. Fun crowd and just right amount of noise. Service at table enthusiastic and attentive. Fun beer selection.

The universal answer to where to go for dinner for my first time in Ithaca was "Maxie's, for sure" Will, our server was fantastic and super responsive to our questions and order. The Oysters were very fresh and we just missed the half-price happy hour. We ordered two-dozen, they were THAT good. The drink menu was perfect, I wanted to sample the shrimp-topped bloody Mary but I stuck with the tipsy Gardener, which was a Vodka-based drink, that tasted like it was mixed with Grandma's lemonade. The cornbread sides were annihilated upon touchdown as was the gumbo soup over rice in a cup. My girlfriend had the Blackened catfish over rice and beans with collared greens and it was heavenly. I ordered the shrimp and grits (smaller plate, they offer two sizes) with the andouille sausage and it did not dissapoint. The shrimps were uber-fresh and the grits had a great, buttery/spicy flavor to them. You can spend like you're in NYC here, which we did - but we did not care. We almost went back again during a 4-night stay. Love it!
I LOVED Maxies when it first opened. Great good, cozy, good prices. Then Boatyard and the late Bistro Q opened and the Prices went from $9 to $17. The bad are the place is very loud and hard to talk in, and the prices are outragous.  We used to go once a month when they opened now our budget allows us once a year. However the food is top notch.  The Service is always good.  Just wish I could go more often.
Maxie's is amazing. I've been here when the power was out and when there was a huge snowstorm outside. Whether the weather is good or crazy, the staff is always superior and wonderful. If you've never been here before, be sure to check out the fresh oyster bar and the jambalaya. On Tuesday and Sunday nights you can also hear live music here! This is one of my favorite hangouts in Ithaca.
I come here for oyster shooters, crab cakes and red white and blue cole slaw.  :)
I started to go to Maxie's when it first opened back in 1997. Or was it '96? Great food back then. Recently went back and the food is just as good as I remembered. Food, drinks, atmosphere...all awesome.
Love this place! I visit this place every time I hit Ithaca. The Raw Bar, shrimp and grits, Po' boys, etc all good. Only downside is how cramped it is. I know it says its okay for kids but I wouldn't recommend taking kids especially young ones. Just the atmosphere isn't really conducive for them.
3.5/5 star rating. Ended up here on a Saturday night because the place we were headed to, we couldn't figure out the parking. We drove by this place and a spot just opened up--SOLD! The food was good not super great. Hubs had a fried chicken meal--for what it cost not worth it. But it was tasty. I had the fish tacos. Those were more appropriately priced for what it was. The ambiance/decor was very good though. This definitely is a nice place to take a date or if you want a nice place to eat outside and chill. I'd go back here again.

I knew this was going to be a good experience when I smelled the deliciousness of the food from the parking lot. Fortunately for my group, we were seated immediately. The service was good, our waiter was very patient with us and spent the time to explain some of the dishes on the menu and answered our questions. The portions are big, but decent considering the price. Ordered the Jambalaya, which was very spicy and flavorful. I sampled my friends catfish and crab cakes which were also good. I really enjoyed the food here and look forward to dining here again if I am ever in Ithaca. And you get stickers with your check!
I was really pleased with the blackened swordfish. Nothing pretentious and seasoned to perfection. Swordfish can be hard to keep moist, however they pulled it off. The oysters were also amazing. Not just good, ammmaaaazing!!!! Prices were a little steep but almost justifiable. Definitely a must experience if in Ithaca!
This place is okay for cajun food. The decor is pretty cool it looks like a house on the outside. Overall when you walk in your will be started off with corn bread and their honey butter. The corn bread isn't the best I've ever had but is decent but who can say no to that when you walk in hungry. The other dishes are okay your typical standard fried fish dishes are all good including calamari crawfish etc The sandwiches and shrimp and grits are also decent here. The raw oysters seem pretty fresh too. They have a half off oyster deals before 6 pm.  The service is good and the people are friendly. They will actually split your check here for you which is nice and convenient. Overall I would recommend only going for this deal. Everything else seems pretty pricey and I've had better Cajun dishes elsewhere though I guess for Ithaca this is probably the best it gets and in that case go for it if you are craving those Southern comforts.
If you want the best food, atmosphere and service in Ithaca, NY... Get to Maxies!
Personally I think this is one of the most overrated restaurants in Ithaca, not because its bad, but because so many people seem to be die-hard fans. They serve classic southern food, pulled pork, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, ribs, and also a wide variety of seafood. The non-seafood items are all fairly tasty but quite expensive, and have a low degree of difficulty (not too hard to do fried food right). Their seafood dishes are just ho-hum, but you can't expect super fresh seafood in Ithaca. I tried their oysters last time I went, and have to say they were more sandy than usual. In addition the cornbread is cold and really dry. If your looking for something cheap and tasty on the menu, surprisingly their grilled vegetarian sandwich/poboy is really good. The service here has been hit or miss. Once the waitress spilled a drink on my tie and pretty much ruined it. She offered an on the house drink, but I wasn't drinking. I asked if I could get an appetizer instead, she said no. For god sake she ruined a 50$ tie and wouldn't accommodate the designated driver by offering something other than alcohol. Frankly I'm a bit upset at this place for this.
My favorite eatery in Ithaca.  Great amazing Oysters!  Excellent beer selection.  Shrimp and Grits with Tazo gravy are excellent, through in a grilled Andouille sausage and you are good to go.  If you are around for News Year get the chef's tasting menu you will not be disappointed.
I was highly skeptical of shrimp and grits made in upstate New York, but this place knocked my socks off. Great service, incredible food, and really good drinks. Loved it. Definitely coming back next time I'm in town.
Been here a number of times. Jambalaya and Gumbo are my favorites.  The Maker's Mark Mint Julep is a bourbon slushy and amazing.  the fact that they are open late is a huge plus.  One of the few places in Ithaca where you can get alcohol and food after 9pm that is not a chain.
Holy crap this place has huge portions. If you have the option to go smaller, do it (if you want a regular sized meal or lean towards smaller portions). This place is fairly expensive but the portions make up for this and you will not be disappointed with that. However, I would be more than satisfied with my half rack of baby back ribs (it was as if their full rack doubled in size compared to a full rack elsewhere). Fresh oysters are what they are known for. I have never been a fan of raw oysters but this place made it fairly edible so I was surprised about that. For me they are at best a neutral food. So take this as a positive since I considered it alright and not disgusting. This place gets crowded very quicky during regular dinner times and the atmosphere is fairly crowded so if you don't like stuffy dining then you might want to come here at a more obscure time. Aside from that, good tasting food, fairly expensive but best oysters in town from what everyone says.
This was the first restaurant I ever ate at in Ithaca and it is still one of my favorites. Wonderful ambiance, and it's nice when you can sit outside in the summer. The food is amazing, as are the hot cornbread pieces that they always give you while you are waiting. Love the live music too!  Five stars, all the way.
Allow me to get the bad stuff out of the way first, so that the great stuff is what lasts with you afterwards. Firstly, the parking lot has multiple pot holes and it is fairly difficult to find a parking spot late at night. Secondly, some of the tables in the area around the bar are awkwardly tall, so that when you are sitting they're height level is at your higher chest level. Lastly, it's located right near a train track, so if a train happens to pass through (though, admittedly, this doesn't happen often) be ready for a loud and obnoxious box car orchestra. And the following reasons are why you should still try out Maxie's: Firstly: The staff is incredibly efficient, Wonderfully charming, and fully adequate in all their service. Secondly: The food is rich and heavenly. I ordered a cup of the Corn and Crab Chowder which was filling and tasty, as well as a jambalaya which was spicy and delicious. I ate it even though I hate tomatoes with a passion! Well, to be fair, I didn't eat all of it, but by God, I tried. Thirdly: The music. It's live and it's not too loud and it's not too quiet, it's just right. It really does strike up a folkish or country-esque mood which is perfect for your friends and family. Lastly: The bar. It's a full bar and it has everything you could ever want. And the bartenders are charming people. They're great conversationalists and are very reliable to make you exactly what you would like. All in all, it's a wonderful place. By all means go and have a good time!
The Shrimp & Grits with andouille sausage is fantastic.  Very hearty, and great flavor.  Just a hint of spice, but not hot.  Good caesar salad, as well.  Nice atmosphere and super friendly server, as well.
Very cool place with southern style food.  The damn good fish fry and fish tacos were damn good.  Service was super and even though we had a wait for a table it went quicker than expected.  This is obviously a neighborhood favorite and I agree!
I had not been in a while. I went the other day and found the jambalaya tasted reheated at best.
Very cozy, bustling restaurant that often plays live music. It's clearly very popular and offers great service. Our waitress was really sweet and the restaurant gave off that southern hospitality vibe. Having visited New Orleans a few times, I couldn't help but be disappointed by the gumbo soup and jambalaya I ordered. The gumbo tasted more like a beef stew and the jambalaya was less flavorful than I hoped. My boyfriend got the shrimp and grits, however, which was delicious. One thing I loved was that Maxie's partners with local charities for fundraisers. When we were there, they were donating $5 for every chicken fried chicken or bbq tofu ordered and $1 for a certain type of beer. It really upped my appreciation for the restaurant and added to the positive experience.
Their  1/2 priced- raw bar Happy Hour from 4-6pm is not to be missed. If you're a fan of raw oysters then get your ass over to Maxie's. There is usually a variety, ok maybe a max of 3 different types of oysters daily. There is a chalkboard menu of daily specials on the wall. The restaurant is dimly lit, cramped and the patrons can get a bit rowdy. We ordered a dozen raw oysters, fried green tomatoes, vegetarian jambalaya, shrimp and grits, and a tuna special. The raw oysters were fresh and terrific. The fried green tomatoes were done well and came with Thousand Island dressing. The entrees were mediocre. The vegetarian jambalaya had tofu, veggies and pecans in it. It was different, the pecans were a nice touch but overall the dish was a bit bland.  The shrimp and grits were tasty but the dish was probably more appetizer appropriate.  I would definitely come back here but probably just for the raw bar happy hour.
Daytime on my last two central New York trips was reserved for driving around in search of pointy buildings, waterfalls and barbecued chicken, so I was quite thankful for the late hours at Maxie's. The shrimp and grits had great flavor and texture, while the gumbo was far better than I'd expect this far north. The service was very good, including a thorough response to my question about which country roads would be least scary for my night drive back to Binghamton.
Great place with quality seafood and a REAL Oyster Bar.Great drink specials and Southern style food. A must eat place if you are in Ithaca. Friendly servers and a great menu.
Nice restaurant with a lively vibe and good for families. To start we got the Supper Club Salad to share and it was delicious. It was dressed nicely and a perfect way to begin our meal. For entrees, my husband had a po'boy and I had a half portion of the shrimp and grits. He enjoyed his, though he felt it was on the smaller side. I really enjoyed my shrimp and grits. It was also the perfect portion for the dinner. Overall it was a really tasty meal in a fun environment with friendly and quick service. What more can you ask for?
Really great food with an extremely helpful staff!
After driving past Maxie's many times, we finally decided to give it a try on an off-night since we had read that it can get quite busy. Turns out we didn't really pick an off-night since they have live music on Tuesday nights and a popular fried chicken dish, but we did come early enough to get a table without waiting. It was definitely starting to get busy after 5:30 pm. First impressions were very good--the interior is a funky layout and has a lot of character. The people were quite friendly and our server was helpful with introducing us to different aspects of the restaurant when we said it was our first time. So for service, I give it 5 stars; I didn't feel anything was lacking. We even saw who I think must be the head chef on the way out and she thanked us for coming. The food was pretty good, but I think it was more of a 3 or 4 star experience. They have a good beer and drink selection, considering they have a full bar. The specials included a southern fried chicken dish, which my wife tried. It was pretty good. I had the crab cake po' boy, which tasty but not memorable. I found the french bread to be a bit mushy, and the corn bread to be cold and dry. Next time we'll be sure to try other seafood specials as well as oysters.
Awesome oyster po boy, gumbo, bloody mary's....and live music!
3 word's....Fried Chicken Tuesdays I've resigned myself to only coming on Tuesdays because the friend chicken, taters and their gravy is out of this world. The Chicken is fried perfectly, outside is crispy, batter has lots of flavor and the chicken is oh so juicy and tastes so good. You get a good size chicken breast too! The Mashed Potatoes are great too! Not overbeaten but not lumpy, just perfect. What really wins here is the gravy. Idk what is in the gravy, how they make it or why it is so good but I don't care. I put it on my chicken, on my taters and I will just eat it with a spoon. It is sooooooo good. What knocks this place down a star is because we went on a separate occasion and I deviated and decided to try the Crabcake Po'Boy with Fries and their crawfish fried popper things. Their crawfish poppers are too bready. I tasted nothing but flour. Granted I can understand that crawfish tails are small and there's nothing you can really do about the batter but maybe a cornmeal batter or something would make this better. The Po'Boy came on french bread like bread and it was toasted to a crisp. On top of that there was a lot of bread for the crabcake they gave me. I tasted almost nothing but bread. There wasn't a lot of veggies on it either. The crabcake had good flavor though, I wish it would've been slightly more crispier but it was good. Slightly small though. The fries were good too, just your normal french fry but that's not a bad thing. Overall I would come back but only for Fried Chicken Tuesday I think. If you are in the mood for the BEST fried chicken, get down to try this place, you will NOT be disappointed.
Maxie's was my favorite place in Ithaca to head to for a good food and great atmosphere when I was in college, so I was excited to head there for a meal after a visit last weekend. However, it was a bit disappointing. Maybe my tastes in dining have changed over the last 7 or so years, but the entire experience felt very rushed and it kind of ruined it for us. The food came out fast (no complaints there), but the waitstaff seemed to also be moving around at the same speed. None of them took the time to even pretend to be glad we were coming in for dinner - hardly a smile, and a look of general annoyance seemed to be on all of their faces. I flagged down our server as he passed by shortly after we ordered and he told me he was busy and would come back as soon as he could, which to me felt like an unacceptable thing to say to a table. I hadn't even asked him a question yet. Needless to say the food was decent and they have a lot of options for everyone to choose from. The place is cramped, dark, and loud...not the best for a leisurely dining experience. Probably won't be back for a long time.
Great service and yummy food.  Our party of six was seated right away at 6:00 on a Sunday night.  The joint was packed by 7.  We had fried green tomatoes, BBQ shrimp, corn bread, fried oysters, shrimp and grits, and sausage skewers.  Portions, even half portions, were ample.  Huge wine list and decent beer selection.  Loved the music by a solo blues guitarist.  Loses a star only because the food was solid but not transporting.  We didn't try dessert but will next time.
My wife and I are regulars. The food is amazing but I'm little disappointed that they've reduced the size of their portions recently.
My second time having Cajun food and now I love it even more! Before getting into the food I want to describe the cool atmosphere at this place. The actual decor is really cool and very hip and my favorite part was the music choice- ranging from Bob Marley to Kings of Leon and The Black Keys. Service was super friendly and the food came out in a timely matter. Monday night special is $10 off any bottle of wine so I was already loving this place based on this. We got a bottle of white from the finger lakes and as appetizers we got the crab cakes (delicious) and gumbo. As for the main course- the jambalaya was a must and it did not disappoint at all. The portions were reasonable and the food was super tasty. As I mentioned before, this was only my second time having any sort of Cajun food so I am no expert at all but I was very satisfied with the flavors and presentation. The only downside to this place is the fact that it's located in Ithaca and I am from Long Island(about a 6 hour drive) so I'm not sure what the chances of being back there are but if you are a local you absolutely should make this the go to place to hang out and get some great food!!
Lovely dinner.  The servers were very attentive but not intrusive.  Food was terrific.  Now for the downside...there was no air conditioning in my dining room and during a week-long heat wave, this was a definite issue.  All the diners were red-faced and sweaty.  Sadly, there were was only one local white wine on the by-the-glass menu and it was not a good wine for seafood.  Also, they did not have a single tap beer from a local brewery.  I found this surprising in area know for great local wines and beers.  Bottom line, the food was delicious and the waitstaff knowledgeable.  I look forward to a return visit.  Hopefully, it will be cooler or they will have a/c!
I like Maxie's for what it is, a locally owned, comfortable restaurant with a cool vibe and good service. We have been coming here off and on for the past 5 years and we have never been disappointed.  While the food is not amazing, it is fresh, plentiful and priced right.  They have delicious gumbo.  This time the corn bread was served with too cold honey butter.  My chicken fried chicken was good, but I would have preferred my chicken on the bone.  The accompanying Swiss chard was bomb. We started with a delicious variety of oysters (12) and little neck clams (6) with appropriate sauces.  No shell, sweet meat, these were a real treat from the ordinary chicken wings everyone eats in these parts. My man had two apps for his entree, fried green tomatoes and the crab cake.  While I did not try the crab, he loved it.  The tomatoes were tangy and crisp, yum. Our visiting friends from NYC made this meal even more special and I believe they enjoyed their meals as well. Check this place out if you are in Ithaca and you like raw bars and creole food.
amazing. i was in ithaca for a charity event and visiting all the places my mom and aunt remember from being raised there. we celebrated by going to maxie's and it was SO GOOD. the service was great- staff is friendly and helpful and witty. i tried everything on our table... pulled pork, beans, cornbread, cod, haddock, sp fries, crab and corn chowder-- everything was superb! drinks were great too! the atmosphere is fun. they had live music near the bar and outdoor seating under a canopy. the place it small but it adds to the personality.
Kinda disappointed. We saw really good reviews on this place so we wanted to check it out during our visit to Ithaca. I have to say, the complimentary cornbread was amazeballs. Still, the oysters were a huge disappointment. We got a dozen, a variety of the three kinds they had, which were bluepoint, malpeque, and i can't remember what the last one was, but it had no flavor anyway.  All the good reviews said the oysters were amazing but i thought they were okay. I've had better. The garlic steamed clams were somewhat tasty but nothing to die for. The waiter suggested the black current iced tea, which I thought was on point. Overall, the service and atmosphere were pretty good but the food was okay. We didn't try the entrees so maybe one day I'll give it another chance.
I LOVED Maxies when it first opened. Great good, cozy, good prices. Then Boatyard and the late Bistro Q opened and the Prices went from $9 to $17. The bad are the place is very loud and hard to talk in, and the prices are outragous.  We used to go once a month when they opened now our budget allows us once a year. However the food is top notch.  The Service is always good.  Just wish I could go more often.
We arrived for "happy hour" but the only specials were on the raw bar. There were no drink specials, which was a shame because all of the alcohol offerings were on the more expensive side (craft beers $6-8, wine $7-9, PBR $3.50). There was no refill on sodas but they didn't tell us that. It was Chicken Fried Tuesday so we ordered one chicken dinner ($11.95) and a bowl of gumbo ($8.50). The chicken was fine, not spectacular. There is a $1 up charge for gravy, which is just greedy. The gravy came in a tiny vessel, practically a thimble, not enough to pour over the mash and not enough to enjoy, which was a shame because it was the only thing that had real flavor. The gumbo was fine, but not great. We did an oyster shooter and mine still had shards of shell in it. One got stuck on my gum and cut me. Really dangerous and negligent not to clean your oysters when you know they are going down as a shooter!   Overall, this place is expensive and not worth the prices. The food and the atmosphere were okay but I just got the impression from the grumpy proprietress that all she saw in customers were dollar signs and that's not enough for me to either recommend this place, or return.
Love this place! I visit this place every time I hit Ithaca. The Raw Bar, shrimp and grits, Po' boys, etc all good. Only downside is how cramped it is. I know it says its okay for kids but I wouldn't recommend taking kids especially young ones. Just the atmosphere isn't really conducive for them.
This place is great. Has that french quarter/New Orleans feel with the same great fare to accompany it. It's awkwardly laid out and cramped and busy but worth grabbing a drink at the bar and hanging out for a table. Even with two young kids. The staff is very friendly and did anything to make us and the little ones feel comfortable while we waited. The cornbread to start is fantastic. Perfectly made. All dishes have a proper amount of seasoning and spice to them. I had a blackened tacos special that was fantastic! Tasted home made and very fresh. The wife got the pulled pork and was equally satisfied. We will most likely make this a mandatory stop if/when we are in the Ithaca area. Would love to spend more time up here and check out the rest of the city but Maxie's keeps calling us to hang out! Would definitely recommend!
I was really pleased with the blackened swordfish. Nothing pretentious and seasoned to perfection. Swordfish can be hard to keep moist, however they pulled it off. The oysters were also amazing. Not just good, ammmaaaazing!!!! Prices were a little steep but almost justifiable. Definitely a must experience if in Ithaca!
Delicious Cajun food, and outstanding service. Loved the jambalaya, and the corn bread was to die for. Good wines and they even let me try a single oyster, since I've never had one raw.
My favorite eatery in Ithaca.  Great amazing Oysters!  Excellent beer selection.  Shrimp and Grits with Tazo gravy are excellent, through in a grilled Andouille sausage and you are good to go.  If you are around for News Year get the chef's tasting menu you will not be disappointed.
Never have I seen a more intensely barbaric display of aggression toward nature. With the cute and seemingly harmless image of a fish as their logo, I assumed this would be a place where I could indeed enjoy a fine meal; how little did I understand the nightmares in store. My initial shock came as I was served a line of freshly seared shrimp, blackened by the lines of a grill from which the once-vibrant lives of these creatures were replaced by a tempting aroma. Worse yet, they had been neatly covered by chipotle honey, masking their death with a spicy sweet succulence. As if to nonchalantly make light of this display, the plate also sported a colorful bit of slaw with a hint of blue cheese--a creation so unique and inspiring I almost forgot what it accompanied. Though I had heard exclusively positive reviews of the restaurant's Po'Boys, one look at the menu forced my stomach to jump. Crab cake, blackened catfish, fried shrimp, fried oysters, fried shrimp AND oysters?! There was a veritable array of death, spread across soft french bread with all the right Cajun sauces. As I looked around at patrons grasping these sandwiches, I could at least find solace in the fact many of them appeared to focus primarily on the fries. A harmless, yet strangely appealing distraction from the tangy juices dripping from their entrees. In my attempt to order something decidedly non-aquatic, I opted for the piggy platter. Imagine my surprise when I immediately recognized the plate as a heaping pile of land-meat, practically falling off of bones and pulled into messy strips underneath. Between the fragrance of the food itself, the barbeque smoke, and the hearty baked beans beside it, I could not help but shovel the monstrosity into my mouth. I watched myself helplessly as I partook in the strange maniacal sorcery of Maxie's savage ritualistic cooking. I thought the warm and perfectly baked cornbread might restore some semblance of innocence to my being, but it only seemed to complement the abundance of pork in front of me. Never have I been so ashamed to partake in the devouring of my brethren, and yet, the succulence of sin beckons me to return. I'm a fish, by the way.
Been here a number of times. Jambalaya and Gumbo are my favorites.  The Maker's Mark Mint Julep is a bourbon slushy and amazing.  the fact that they are open late is a huge plus.  One of the few places in Ithaca where you can get alcohol and food after 9pm that is not a chain.
I've ate here twice and both times have been very delicious! The complimentary cornbread is always tasty. The oyster sampling is great for newbies trying to figure out what they like. The shrimp and grits was so creamy and savory, but definitely order the larger portion. There is something on the menu for everyone and I definitely plan on going back! The only reason it's not a 5 star is just because it can be a little pricey for some of the portion sizes. Also it is a very cozy place, almost way too cozy (tiny tables!). Delicious though!!!!
The Shrimp & Grits with andouille sausage is fantastic.  Very hearty, and great flavor.  Just a hint of spice, but not hot.  Good caesar salad, as well.  Nice atmosphere and super friendly server, as well.
Maxie's is solid as a rock. The food is delicious, the service is great and they sell beer koozies. If I lived in Ithaca, I'd be here a few times a month for sure. The signature dish seems to be the shrimp and grits and they are delicious. I've also had the cajun ahi tuna, which was very good but not a home run. The oysters were delicious, although a bit pricey, so show up before 6 for half price oyster happy hour. My specialty tequila cocktail was absolutely delicious. My blueberry bread pudding was more bread than either blueberry or pudding, but still tasty. The banana chocolate cream pie was a standout dessert. The service was very friendly and helpful. The dining room was VERY loud, both with diners and with the clash of plates, silverware and servers from the open kitchen. This kept up the feel of the cajun oyster shack, but give it more of a lively vibe than anything romantic, thoughtful or refined.  Also, the air conditioning on my trip was either on the fritz or simply not adequate for a hot day in the Finger Lakes.
Their  1/2 priced- raw bar Happy Hour from 4-6pm is not to be missed. If you're a fan of raw oysters then get your ass over to Maxie's. There is usually a variety, ok maybe a max of 3 different types of oysters daily. There is a chalkboard menu of daily specials on the wall. The restaurant is dimly lit, cramped and the patrons can get a bit rowdy. We ordered a dozen raw oysters, fried green tomatoes, vegetarian jambalaya, shrimp and grits, and a tuna special. The raw oysters were fresh and terrific. The fried green tomatoes were done well and came with Thousand Island dressing. The entrees were mediocre. The vegetarian jambalaya had tofu, veggies and pecans in it. It was different, the pecans were a nice touch but overall the dish was a bit bland.  The shrimp and grits were tasty but the dish was probably more appetizer appropriate.  I would definitely come back here but probably just for the raw bar happy hour.
It's nice to have a taste of NOLA in Ithaca for sure. The cornbread is amazing, and I love the Chicken and Andouille Gumbo! They also make an amazing BBQ tofu. The service is great as well due to a friendly and knowledgable staff who take care to mind diners food restrictions (i.e. preventing a vegan from ordering french fries cooked in animal fat!). I took off stars, however, for two reasons. First it is crowded and loud. People at the table next to you are basically dining with you - I have shared conversations with them and have been bumped by them while they are getting up and down. Second, the cocktails (that I have had) are mediocre, and I expect top quality cocktails from an establishment that seems so familiar with the spirit of New Orleans.
Really great food with an extremely helpful staff!
Highly recommended spot in Ithaca - fun atmosphere and solid Cajun food. Everything we had was good - fried green tomatoes, Caesar salad, Cajun fish tacos and crab cake po boy. Friendly service and cheap alcohol.
Maxie's was my favorite place in Ithaca to head to for a good food and great atmosphere when I was in college, so I was excited to head there for a meal after a visit last weekend. However, it was a bit disappointing. Maybe my tastes in dining have changed over the last 7 or so years, but the entire experience felt very rushed and it kind of ruined it for us. The food came out fast (no complaints there), but the waitstaff seemed to also be moving around at the same speed. None of them took the time to even pretend to be glad we were coming in for dinner - hardly a smile, and a look of general annoyance seemed to be on all of their faces. I flagged down our server as he passed by shortly after we ordered and he told me he was busy and would come back as soon as he could, which to me felt like an unacceptable thing to say to a table. I hadn't even asked him a question yet. Needless to say the food was decent and they have a lot of options for everyone to choose from. The place is cramped, dark, and loud...not the best for a leisurely dining experience. Probably won't be back for a long time.
Maxie's has a great vibe as soon as you walk in. On certain nights, they have a live band. They have a good selection at their raw bar. I had their crab cakes which were also well-seasoned and tender. Beware that this place can get pretty busy so be prepared to wait.
Lovely dinner.  The servers were very attentive but not intrusive.  Food was terrific.  Now for the downside...there was no air conditioning in my dining room and during a week-long heat wave, this was a definite issue.  All the diners were red-faced and sweaty.  Sadly, there were was only one local white wine on the by-the-glass menu and it was not a good wine for seafood.  Also, they did not have a single tap beer from a local brewery.  I found this surprising in area know for great local wines and beers.  Bottom line, the food was delicious and the waitstaff knowledgeable.  I look forward to a return visit.  Hopefully, it will be cooler or they will have a/c!
Love maxies! Great new orleans food and cozy feel. Every time I come back to Ithaca I have to stop and have dinner here. Wish I lived closer!
Visited from Cleveland.  Had Fried green tomatoes for the first time, very yummy!!!  And the Blueberry bread pudding with maple/strawberry jam is to die for! Slight mishap with one of the dinners but we were well taken care off.  Definitely recommend.
On our way back from Seneca Lake through Ithaca, we planned on a quick trip to Five Guys but decided to consult Yelp at the last minute. Our friend craved seafood, so Maxie's it was! Now, I am that annoying person who hates seafood. Practically everyone I know loves seafood and they feel bad asking me to seafood restaurants, but I go because there's always a token mediocre chicken dish that I can go for. But there's no room for mediocre at Maxie's. I was spoiled for choice. Even beyond their chicken options, they had a decent looking vegetarian menu. I nearly opted for the fried green tomato po' boy, but decided on the fried chicken po' boy instead, with remoulade instead of mayo. The bread was fresh and springy, the tomato was at peak ripeness, the chicken was juicy... a perfect sandwich, really. All in all, a nice time sitting on the covered patio. Will return!
I'd rank this place in my top 3 Ithaca restaurants.  That's a hard thing to do since there's really no place like it, but if you enjoy cajun food, beer or wine, this is worth checking out.  They have a raw bar as well, which is hard to come by in Ithaca (I can't think of another actually).  I've been pleased every time I've gone there and would highly recommend the gumbo with extra cornbread.  Their beer and wine selection is better than most places (at least on the beer side) and the service is quick, accurate, and friendly.  I actually can't think of anything to be critical or improve.  Parking is even easy because of their lot and the uncrowded street out front.
I've had older oysters on the bayou. Shucked right in front of you sweet and salty. Naked cowboys from NY?  Ate here two nights while in Ithaca. Bar is like a scene from New Orleans. Complete with Jazz band on Sun. Fish tacos and soft shell crab po boy were delicious. Their nightly rendition on poutine Is top notch. Dessert chocolate coconut banana cream pie. Yum
Excellent service!  Great food!  Blue Cheese burger #1, Fried chicken is great,  Oyster Po Boy delish!  I keep going back to try and find something to complain about!  Just gotta keep trying, I guess!
We ate here for our last dinner in Ithaca. The ribs were HUGE and delicious. The fries could have been better -- I like 'em crispy, these were a bit limp. My bf ordered 12 oysters (during Happy Hour) for 1/2 price! He had the salmon special which was good, not great. The oysters were really good, very fresh and some are huge (think mini pork chop!). Our favorites were the Naked Cowboys, but with a name like that, how can they be bad? Service was friendly. I recommend this place, yum!
One of my favorite restaurants in Ithaca. Great seafood, Southern flavors. Their gumbo is perfect stick-to-your-ribs food when it's cold outside. The atmosphere inside is fun and cozy. The service is great too. I just wish they were open for lunch!
The price at Maxie's is simply unbelievable for the food quality and portions. I've definitely had better and cheaper oysters, but the food and service were great. My friends and I had just come back from a wine tour so some were disruptive, but the staff handled the situation very professionally. Their po' boys were delicious. They do not take reservations, so I would definitely suggest calling in half an hour in advance to put your name and party on the wait list.
Went to Maxie's for the first time yesterday and I will definitely be back! My boyfriend and I came for drinks and appetizers, the oysters were fresh and delicious, shucked right in front of us. We also had the bbq shrimp which was rich and delicious, with a great spice over two baguettes, YUM. The drinks also were outstanding, mojitos and new specialty drinks both excellent and original. The bartender Melissa was excellent, very knowledge and helpful, best service I've had in along time! Can't wait to return!
Great little place. Nice atmosphere.  Shrimp and grits were great. Jambalaya was good but very spicy.  Check this place out when in Ithaca.
This place came highly recommended, but my experience in the summer of 2010 was pretty mediocre. I can't remember specifically what I disliked (it's been ~6 months), but I have no real desire to try it again.
When I was looking for a place in Ithaca to eat on yelp, I couldn't wait to go. I love cajun and the menu sounded soooooooo good. There was a 5 minute-wait for a table of 5. It's a saturday evening and all the college students are back home in the summer. So it wasn't packed, which I imagine it would be during the fall and spring. I got the crab cake deluxe platter with sweet potato fries and shared with my friend the salmon that was on that day's special. All so good. We got 2 rounds of cornbread too. Our waiter was nice and knowledgeable about the menu. I also got a drink. I forgot the name, but it was a lemonade type drink with a spicy flare to it. It was pretty good. I was sooo full after eating. I wish I had room to order dessert, but I couldn't fit anything else in my stomach. I would come back if I was in town. 1/2 a star off for the sticky table. And I think they separate smoking and non-smoking? We were in the patio-ish room and the other room smelled like smoke (to me anyway). Highly Recommended!
Great food and drinks and very nice staff. The shrimp and grits were awesome.  Really good seafood too, nice fresh oysters too!
Adorable restaurant in Ithaca that's great for a day time lunch or an evening out with friends. Other than the usual oysters during happy hour, they have some great plates like fried green tomatoes to start and Po'Boy sandwiches (especially the blackened catfish). Not a huge variety but their soul food is pretty good, although the gumbo is okay. Free cornbread, delicious.
Tasty drinks, entrees, and desserts.  I feel like you can't really go wrong at Maxie's.
I'm quick to knock a lot of things about the south, but you have to admit the food is pretty damn good. And Maxies does a lot of it right. They delightfully pick and choose their dishes, some LA-style jambalaya, blackened catfish and of course, oysters (though they wisely pick local New England oysters, not Gulf). You want some BBQ? they got some BBQ (I think it was Memphis style). You're a vegetarian? Well, you're in luck, 'cause they're not traditionalists and they've got a tofu po-boy for you. Portions are HUGE, the food is tasty, the atmosphere is great. Thankfully for my waistline, I don't live near enough to become a regular. I could nitpick (e.g., pulled pork was a little dry, cornbread could be better), but who am I kidding? This is an enthusiastic recommendation. Check it out. Or don't, the place can get crowded enough as it is.
Yummy seared tuna dish!  Have it the way the chef prefers to serve it (rare).  Saw the bartender smelling our oysters before serving them - we ate them anyway - and I guess they passed the smell test since no one got sick.  Sometimes my craving for raw oysters causes me to take unnecessary risks.  Fantastic cornbread.
Service: very good Oyster: fabulous Corn bread: yum Jambalaya: okay, not so much a fan, there was too much tomato sauce in it Blackened catfish po'boy: the best (I love it soooo much) Sweet potato fries: tasty, goes well with the cream/butter Price: most of the dishes are not overpriced The only disappointment was my jambalaya (I had some anticipation), but it's not bad.
Best Place EVER!!! Crabcakes are to die for.  if you like oysters this is the place--they always have 3 different ones and you really can taste the difference in location.  Cornbread w/ orange honey butter tarts things off right, and I never pass on dessert.  The gumbo and corn and crab soup is awesome too...I lived in Ithaca 8 years and it's still my fave.
Same as my last meal there four years ago, excellent. Bartenders were informed and made great martinis with local gin. Seated outside. Incredible buffalo calamari, my daughter enjoyed the crab cakes and I loved the fried chicken (add a dark meat option) with the mashed potatoes and crazy good tasso sauce. Fun crowd and just right amount of noise. Service at table enthusiastic and attentive. Fun beer selection.
I like Maxie's a lot.  Their bleu cheeseburger is delicious, they have good drinks, and great desserts.  Service is usually good.  Great ambiance - usually fairly loud, but in a joyful way.
The universal answer to where to go for dinner for my first time in Ithaca was "Maxie's, for sure" Will, our server was fantastic and super responsive to our questions and order. The Oysters were very fresh and we just missed the half-price happy hour. We ordered two-dozen, they were THAT good. The drink menu was perfect, I wanted to sample the shrimp-topped bloody Mary but I stuck with the tipsy Gardener, which was a Vodka-based drink, that tasted like it was mixed with Grandma's lemonade. The cornbread sides were annihilated upon touchdown as was the gumbo soup over rice in a cup. My girlfriend had the Blackened catfish over rice and beans with collared greens and it was heavenly. I ordered the shrimp and grits (smaller plate, they offer two sizes) with the andouille sausage and it did not dissapoint. The shrimps were uber-fresh and the grits had a great, buttery/spicy flavor to them. You can spend like you're in NYC here, which we did - but we did not care. We almost went back again during a 4-night stay. Love it!
My most favorite restaurant in Ithaca (so far)!  I haven't had a plate I didn't like (yet).  I love the cornbread, the fries, the catfish...even the pickle slices are good!  (And I don't like pickles.)  Friendly waiters and just great Southern cooking.  Last time I was there, an old man was playing jazz solo, and it was great.  Sometime I'd like to have drinks at this bar instead of going to the other bars in town.
I started to go to Maxie's when it first opened back in 1997. Or was it '96? Great food back then. Recently went back and the food is just as good as I remembered. Food, drinks, atmosphere...all awesome.
Seafood, cajun, creole southern style place with a great menu offering great appetizers, wonderful soups, an ever changing raw bar,  sides, sandwiches, full entrees, and delicious desserts.  You can easily pick from the menu to make a meal of your choosing.  What I love most about Maxie's is their hours extra long hours and everything is served from open to close.  One of my favorite places for a late dinner or snack.  I have gotten a variety of things from here, from full dinners to stopping in for small items like sandwiches or just desserts.  Every time I am pleased.  The service is wonderful no matter if you are ordering french fries or a full course expensive dinner.  I love their complementary corn bread with orange butter, and their crab soup.  Their wine list is also great with a variety of bottle prices starting at $20.  Great choices by the glass too.
I knew this was going to be a good experience when I smelled the deliciousness of the food from the parking lot. Fortunately for my group, we were seated immediately. The service was good, our waiter was very patient with us and spent the time to explain some of the dishes on the menu and answered our questions. The portions are big, but decent considering the price. Ordered the Jambalaya, which was very spicy and flavorful. I sampled my friends catfish and crab cakes which were also good. I really enjoyed the food here and look forward to dining here again if I am ever in Ithaca. And you get stickers with your check!
One of my favorites in Ithaca. Just a fun place to go with friends and the food is great.
Personally I think this is one of the most overrated restaurants in Ithaca, not because its bad, but because so many people seem to be die-hard fans. They serve classic southern food, pulled pork, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, ribs, and also a wide variety of seafood. The non-seafood items are all fairly tasty but quite expensive, and have a low degree of difficulty (not too hard to do fried food right). Their seafood dishes are just ho-hum, but you can't expect super fresh seafood in Ithaca. I tried their oysters last time I went, and have to say they were more sandy than usual. In addition the cornbread is cold and really dry. If your looking for something cheap and tasty on the menu, surprisingly their grilled vegetarian sandwich/poboy is really good. The service here has been hit or miss. Once the waitress spilled a drink on my tie and pretty much ruined it. She offered an on the house drink, but I wasn't drinking. I asked if I could get an appetizer instead, she said no. For god sake she ruined a 50$ tie and wouldn't accommodate the designated driver by offering something other than alcohol. Frankly I'm a bit upset at this place for this.
Excellent food and service. I have become a regular when in town. Oysters during happy hour are wonderful and a good value. Chicken, cajun fries, fish fry, and fried green tomatoes are excellent. Other menu items look and sound just as good, but I have not had the opportunity to experience them yet.  They have a very good selection of quality beers on tap. They have good quality live music on select nights, starting about 6 or 6:30.
Holy crap this place has huge portions. If you have the option to go smaller, do it (if you want a regular sized meal or lean towards smaller portions). This place is fairly expensive but the portions make up for this and you will not be disappointed with that. However, I would be more than satisfied with my half rack of baby back ribs (it was as if their full rack doubled in size compared to a full rack elsewhere). Fresh oysters are what they are known for. I have never been a fan of raw oysters but this place made it fairly edible so I was surprised about that. For me they are at best a neutral food. So take this as a positive since I considered it alright and not disgusting. This place gets crowded very quicky during regular dinner times and the atmosphere is fairly crowded so if you don't like stuffy dining then you might want to come here at a more obscure time. Aside from that, good tasting food, fairly expensive but best oysters in town from what everyone says.
Went there for dinner last night, and thought it was just okay.  I had been expecting it to be much better given some of the reviews I've read, which probably influenced my experience (high expectations are rarely met).  We were seated in the leftmost room closest to the kitchen, and so you could smell the food being cooked (for me, not a good thing because the smell of cooking fish was not that enjoyable).  The cornbread was good, but a bit too sweet to be great.  I ordered the crabcakes, and they came with the RWB coleslaw and sweet potato fries.  On the plus side, the crabcakes had plenty of crab and not too much filler.  On the other, the crab had a strong fishy smell and taste (perhaps it wasn't that fresh), and the texture was very strange (mushy).  It came topped with a bit of cajun aioli, which was tasty but there wasn't enough of it on top.  The sweet potato fries were fine... perhaps the fries had sat under the lights a little too long because they were a bit cold and almost soggy.  The coleslaw was really disgusting.  It was dressed with (slimy) blue cheese and vinegar.  Not a good taste combo.  My husband ordered a much better dish, the mixed grill special with grits and tasso gravy.  The tasso gravy was really delicious, although the shrimp and beef tenderloin that came with it were just ok.  Their andouille sausage was good, I wonder if they make it in house?  I am not going to rush back to Maxie's, although I would go there again if my friends were going or something.  I'd also get something simpler, like a po' boy.
Every time I return home to Ithaca, I make a point of making Maxie's the first place I stop.  Every.  Single. Time. There is little in the world that can bring a smile to my face like a lime rickey, a cajun grilled Blue Cheese Burger Po Boy (complete with delicious cajun fries), and a slice of key lime pie for dessert. I'm knocking off a star because every time I visit, it seems like they've redone the menu significantly because the whims of the management have changed for that season.  Not a seasonal change, more a "hmm, let's really focus on ____ now" sort of thing.  I do miss the old menu, which was practically flawless.
Visited from Cleveland.  Had Fried green tomatoes for the first time, very yummy!!!  And the Blueberry bread pudding with maple/strawberry jam is to die for! Slight mishap with one of the dinners but we were well taken care off.  Definitely recommend.
This is mostly for the bar, though I have had dinner a few times at Maxie's over the years, I'd give the Dinning area a 4.  It's loud, and the chairs aren't that comfortable, but the food is still amazing.  Love the selection of Fish they always offer.  And generally eclectic but good ambient music (think new Bob Dylan, old Paul Simon, and Zydeco Music). What gets the solid 5 stars is the bar area.  Happy Hour is limited (4-6pm) but ofers half price raw bar items --  a great opportunity to go for some raw oysters and or clams.  They usually have 3 different types of Oysters, and usually offer at least PEI varietal to sample, as well as New England varieties as well.  Two nights a week they feature great local music in the bar area in the evening times.  I'd check the website for details, line-ups, and any associated specials.  In general, this may be one of my favorite places to enjoy a weekday happy hour IN THE USA!  No lie... A recent visit after a 3 year hiatus found nothing changed at the bar.  The service was great, the oysters were super fresh, and the prices were decent.  I was really excited to find a cocktail list dominated by cocktails using liquor from Finger Lakes Distilling, an awesome local distillery.  Great place over all, if you're in Ithaca and have not been, go and check it out.
I'd rank this place in my top 3 Ithaca restaurants.  That's a hard thing to do since there's really no place like it, but if you enjoy cajun food, beer or wine, this is worth checking out.  They have a raw bar as well, which is hard to come by in Ithaca (I can't think of another actually).  I've been pleased every time I've gone there and would highly recommend the gumbo with extra cornbread.  Their beer and wine selection is better than most places (at least on the beer side) and the service is quick, accurate, and friendly.  I actually can't think of anything to be critical or improve.  Parking is even easy because of their lot and the uncrowded street out front.
It's been four years since I ate at Maxie's, but every time I drink a Bloody Mary I think about Maxie's perfect bloody garnished with shrimp and how the one I'm drinking isn't as good. I used to date a guy in Ithaca, and when I rolled into town late Friday night, we'd go to Maxie's for poboys. The cornbread is fabulous and a waiter once told me the secret of their divine honey butter: orange juice. The crabcakes are light and flaky, not like the salty doorstops they make in New England, and the jambalaya is heavy with shrimp and andouille. Portions are huge, atmosphere is fun yet romantic, and everything is so reasonably priced. Maxie's, maybe I'll be back someday.
Excellent service!  Great food!  Blue Cheese burger #1, Fried chicken is great,  Oyster Po Boy delish!  I keep going back to try and find something to complain about!  Just gotta keep trying, I guess!
Maxie's is a must visit restaurant in Ithaca. I like the food, so delicious! The services are great too!
One of my favorite restaurants in Ithaca. Great seafood, Southern flavors. Their gumbo is perfect stick-to-your-ribs food when it's cold outside. The atmosphere inside is fun and cozy. The service is great too. I just wish they were open for lunch!
I liked Maxie's Supper club.  I liked the name, I like the comfortableness and somewhat hip feel of the place.  The waiters, waitress's are all young, attractive and pleasant.  Food is acceptable.  I thought the prices were a little high for mediocre food. I had one issue here.  We came in at 6:01-6:02...and I told the waiter that we would have the 2 for 1 Oysters as appetizers ONLY if we could get the 2 for 1 price (which ended at 6PM).  He said..."Ummmm...I'll have to check, because it ends at 6PM."  Well, cuz you know oysters are expensive Being only a few minutes past 6...I figured he could work it out.  And if he COULD make it happen, then we would like a big plate of Oysters......if not, then we would not want any oysters. I figured if it was a question of giving us the order for half price...or not ordering them at all, the manager would rather see us run up our bill....than skip the appetizers altogether. He brought the big plate of oysters and I figured he came thru for us.  Yay! Well, the bill came, and I realized that he had charged me full price.  When I questioned this, he said "I checked and was told that we couldn't offer the half-price since it was a couple of minutes past 6".  Which is fine, but I wouldn't have ordered them otherwise.  I asked my tablemates if I was clear when I spoke to him, and they all remember me saying to skip it if we could get the 1/2 price offer. Not wanting to get into a to-do over it with a group of people....I simply deducted the amount of the discount I was expecting from his tip.  (And I usually tip well.)  I figured I wasn't going to pay for this...and since it was his fault, he was. I can't tell if this was a simple misunderstanding...or a waiter trying to "pull something". I would go there again, but again, go over the bill item by item.
Went to Maxie's for the first time yesterday and I will definitely be back! My boyfriend and I came for drinks and appetizers, the oysters were fresh and delicious, shucked right in front of us. We also had the bbq shrimp which was rich and delicious, with a great spice over two baguettes, YUM. The drinks also were outstanding, mojitos and new specialty drinks both excellent and original. The bartender Melissa was excellent, very knowledge and helpful, best service I've had in along time! Can't wait to return!
Got the recommendation to go from my Professor, who also enjoys seafood. Got the Po-Boy, per his recommendation, and oh boy was it good! Very cool atmosphere too.
This place came highly recommended, but my experience in the summer of 2010 was pretty mediocre. I can't remember specifically what I disliked (it's been ~6 months), but I have no real desire to try it again.
Every time I return home to Ithaca, I make a point of making Maxie's the first place I stop.  Every.  Single. Time. There is little in the world that can bring a smile to my face like a lime rickey, a cajun grilled Blue Cheese Burger Po Boy (complete with delicious cajun fries), and a slice of key lime pie for dessert. I'm knocking off a star because every time I visit, it seems like they've redone the menu significantly because the whims of the management have changed for that season.  Not a seasonal change, more a "hmm, let's really focus on ____ now" sort of thing.  I do miss the old menu, which was practically flawless.
Great food and drinks and very nice staff. The shrimp and grits were awesome.  Really good seafood too, nice fresh oysters too!
This place was EXCELLENT!  I was in Ithaca for a conference a few weeks ago and this was literally one of the only redeeming qualities of being there.  The grits were fantastic, as was the cornbread.  The portions were ENORMOUS, which was great since the food was super tasty.   This single experience made up for the 8000 million degree weather + 200% humidity + being away from the love of my life and my dog.  GO HERE!
Tasty drinks, entrees, and desserts.  I feel like you can't really go wrong at Maxie's.
This is mostly for the bar, though I have had dinner a few times at Maxie's over the years, I'd give the Dinning area a 4.  It's loud, and the chairs aren't that comfortable, but the food is still amazing.  Love the selection of Fish they always offer.  And generally eclectic but good ambient music (think new Bob Dylan, old Paul Simon, and Zydeco Music). What gets the solid 5 stars is the bar area.  Happy Hour is limited (4-6pm) but ofers half price raw bar items --  a great opportunity to go for some raw oysters and or clams.  They usually have 3 different types of Oysters, and usually offer at least PEI varietal to sample, as well as New England varieties as well.  Two nights a week they feature great local music in the bar area in the evening times.  I'd check the website for details, line-ups, and any associated specials.  In general, this may be one of my favorite places to enjoy a weekday happy hour IN THE USA!  No lie... A recent visit after a 3 year hiatus found nothing changed at the bar.  The service was great, the oysters were super fresh, and the prices were decent.  I was really excited to find a cocktail list dominated by cocktails using liquor from Finger Lakes Distilling, an awesome local distillery.  Great place over all, if you're in Ithaca and have not been, go and check it out.
Yummy seared tuna dish!  Have it the way the chef prefers to serve it (rare).  Saw the bartender smelling our oysters before serving them - we ate them anyway - and I guess they passed the smell test since no one got sick.  Sometimes my craving for raw oysters causes me to take unnecessary risks.  Fantastic cornbread.
Great restaurant option in Ithaca! the vibe is cool and the food was pretty delicious.  In NYC this would get 3 stars, but in Ithaca it gets an extra point. The blakened catfish was pretty damn tasty and came with rice and beans that were acceptable. There was also entertainment besides the live music because of 2 very awkward first dates going on near us.  It was like dinner and a show!
Best Place EVER!!! Crabcakes are to die for.  if you like oysters this is the place--they always have 3 different ones and you really can taste the difference in location.  Cornbread w/ orange honey butter tarts things off right, and I never pass on dessert.  The gumbo and corn and crab soup is awesome too...I lived in Ithaca 8 years and it's still my fave.
