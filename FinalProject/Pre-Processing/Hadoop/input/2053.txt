Had dinner with a few friends over the holidays here - made a reservation the same day no problem and even moved it back a little without an issue. We started with the calamari diavolo as an appetizer and opted to get it tossed in the sweet chili sauce, which I'd definitely recommend. I've had calamari this way many times before and it's a great alternative to the typical marinara option. Everyone grabbed some drinks - two which were off their menu were the raspberry mojito and green envy martini (cucumber and lime with vodka). Both were good, not very strong though. Our friends commented on the fact that they didn't try to put a ton of ice in the drinks to water them down though or make them seem bigger than they were, which is always a plus. Specialty drinks were about $8 each. For the main entrée, I ordered the pecan crusted maple chicken, which came with red skin potatoes and corn. The waitress asked if I wanted to the syrup drizzle on top of the chicken itself or on the side, which was nice to have both options. Chicken was cut thin, breaded in crushed pecans and lightly pan fried. I was pleased that it wasn't greasy whatsoever and wasn't overseasoned or salty. Tried a friend's crab cake too, which was also very good. Not too much filler ingredients and came with some sort of aioli on the side. The waitress we had was very attentive and willing to make sure everything was just right with our meals. Overall, our visit was very enjoyable. Atmosphere is not too loud making it very easy to hold a conversation, service was on top of everything, and food/drinks tasted good. Could have a little more ambience, seemed like the lights could've been dimmed a little more with maybe some candles to make it feel more upscale, but this wouldn't stop us from coming back again. Would definitely recommend for anyone looking to have a nice dinner and casual atmosphere.
I've been here multiple times for lunch and believe it's the best spot in the suburbs.
Excellent prices on drinks, friendly staff, and great DJ Friday and Saturday nights.  Also, the hog wings are amazing!
We had a small get together for a organization I belong to.  There was a seperate room available to us which was great.  They were accomodating by having separate checksfor us. I ordered the vegetable risotto which was very creamy and tasty- no complaints- just a touch overpriced.
This is another place that was on my list to try that I found to be disappointing.  I had heard (and read) great things and found everything to be just so-so.   We received a very friendly greeting at the door and were seated right away on a Saturday evening.  The menus (drink and food) were quite complete.  We decided on (Angus) burgers (because we had heard they were great) with a Mediterranean Spread Platter (roasted red pepper olive tapenade, bruschetta spread & black bean-shittake mushroom hummus served with warm pita, cucumber, and sliced roma tomatoes) as an appetizer.  It was okay, but nothing really special.  The tapenade had no roasted red pepper, but  lots of very salty black olives.  The brushetta spead was overly garlicy. The portion size was good, but the flavors lacked dimension, interest, and balance. Our burgers were brought to the table before we were finished with our appetizer. They looked nice, but were kind of crowded on their very small plates.  We both remarked on how silly it was the our appetizer plates were the size of dinner plates and our dinner was served on rectangular bread sized plates.  The burgers were accompanied by french fries (the overly greasy double fried kind) and a pickle wedge.  Neither of us found them (the "Classic" with Swiss cheese for me, and the "California" with avocado, melted provolone cheese, and a side of southwestern ranch for my boyfriend) to be particularly flavorful. They were cooked to our specifications, but were both kind of dry and tasteless.   The highlight of our evening (and the reason for three stars instead of two) was our waitress, Lisa.  She was friendly and helpful.... welcoming and present (but not overly so) promptly refilling our water glasses and asking us if there was anything she could bring us.....In fact, we found the personalities of all of the people working there far superior to the food that was served.
We went on Valentine's day. All of our food was fresh and delicious. However we were not informed of the prefix menu, which we were not happy about AT ALL. Dinner was expensive and we would have liked to order what we wanted off the real menu for that price. Our service was good and she offered to ask the kitchen if we could have a dish off the real menu. Satisfied.
Went to dinner with the girls and it was mediocre at best.   My burger was overcooked, a fellow dinner's was under-cooked.  French fries were smashed into a small cup.  the wait time for burgers was unbelievable long.   However, the bartender gets 5 stars.  She was very friendly, offered many tasty drinks and encouraged us to order bar appetizers at 50% off.
Best lounge/restaurant in the East Amherst/Clarence even Lockport area. From brunch to dinner to drinks at night, everything is really good! The brunch menu is amazing! For dinner i got the sunny side up burger! It beats any burger out there in Buffalo!

Sat at the bar and ordered a burger medium rare. The first one they sent out the bun was burnt the second one was well done wtf is the line cook doing here?

Don't have any food - we came here to meet up with friends after they had dinner on a Saturday night. It was an interesting mixed crowd, old, wasted, young, and woo girls. The drinks were spot on, some of the guys we were with complained about weak pours but my mixed drinks seemed fine. I had the raspberry mojito which I loved and would come back for. The cranberry cooler tasted like a lesser smaller version of the mojito. It wasn't crowded and you could get served quickly.

Came here for Restaurant Week with some life long lady friends, mom, & sister. Made a reservation hours before for 5:30pm and got right in. YAY! At 5:30, there were only a few other tables occupied. Perfect time to go, in my opinion. I'm the early bird special type. Can't eat dinner at 8pm because I go to bed early! By the time we were leaving, the place was packed! The atmosphere is nice and chic inside. Our round table was roomy but not so huge that the 5 of us couldn't chat. Big plus! I ordered the strip loin $20.12 meal. Came with a garden salad to start (with REALLY good ranch dressing!), green beans and roasted potatoes on the side. The steak was honestly some of the best I've ever had out. It was prepared PERFECTLY and tasted fresh, not like old, tough cow! BIG plus! Of course, I wouldn't expect less from the grandson of Russell Salvatore (owns YOLO)- that guy has the hook up on beef (or so I hear from Russell's patrons). The dinner was finished with a DELICIOUS little scoop of pumpkin gelato. Tasted like pumpkin pie filling! YUM YUM YUM. I honestly have no complaints about YOLO. I really liked it, the service was good, food was great, we all left fat & happy! Give this place a shot, you won't regret it!

We've been twice now, once right after opening and once since. Each time the food was great, the prices are AMAZING - especially considering the freshness and quality of the food, and the service was friendly and knowledgeable. Management came twice to make sure we were enjoying our experience. We tried a few of the specialty drinks and loved them all - especially the cucumber one. I had a caprese salad, the presentation was adorable and it was seasoned really well. 2 others ordered burgers which were big and juicy, and our 4th ordered the monte cristo and was pleased, saying that "it's not like bennigan's... it's a real one." The fries? So good! Wings are saucy so keep that in mind if you like them drier. We also split the stuffed mushrooms which were cooked really well and tasted great. We finished with one order of the crustless cheesecake, I was very impressed - excellent flavor, creamy yet somehow light. We're looking forward to going back to try dinner sometime soon! I'll update my review once we do :-)

Checked out this newly opened restaurant while back in my husband's hometown for Christmas. YOLO stands for You Only Live Once, and doubles as a lounge after the kitchen closes, so I was a bit dubious as to how well it would go over with our dining companions, my mother-in-law and her friend, fearing it might be too youthful or trendy for them. I was mistaken-- both the dining and bar areas boast simple yet modern decor, making it classy yet still comfortable & inviting for all age ranges. The same goes for the food-- a wide range of of choices (some with more of a twist than others), sittin' pretty on clean white dinnerware.   Onto the food! My raspberry mojito was yumness-- it was freshly muddled and not made from a mix. The salads are HUGE (easily could be gotten as an entree as 2 of us splitting it had heaping mounds of it) and looked beautiful in the bowls they were brought out in. Stuffed mushroom appetizer was solid. The standout dish was my maple pecan chicken entree-- sooooo good. My husband's sausage ravioli with Alfredo was rich but delish, though he said he would we getting the chicken the next time. (Told you it was good!) I thought prices were incredibly reasonable for what we got. I could easily see how the bar/lounge area could make for a fun evening-- it's quite large. And they do have a more traditional late night/bar food (wings, quesadillas, etc) over there. We were also told that their more fancy schmancy drinks will be $5 on Wednesdays and that they will be doing a Monday through Friday happy hour. My mother-in-law thinks it would be a great place to do happy hour and will definitely be coming back for dinner, as she said it's rare to find a nice restaurant like this outside of downtown. To sum it up, YOLO offers traditional (delicious!) American food with a touch of class & refinement that appeals to all. Check it out!

I went here for dinner during Restaurant Week. I got the strawberry pecan salad and fish tacos. The salad was very good. Beautiful strawberries with pecans, chunks of bleu cheese, and onions in a poppyseed dressing. I think next time I go I will ask that the onions be taken off. The entree came with 3 different fish tacos that I thought were very inconsistent. One was more blackened than the others, and had more spices. I wouldn't get them again. I thought the atmosphere here was great and so was the wait staff. Our waitress was very nice and helpful when we were asking about the menu.

Hmmm a place named after a pop culture saying? Is that what these silver spoon boys learned in Miami? Maybe they should go back to college... I mean nothing says high class lounge like a strip mall in Clarence... I noticed the silver wear and side plates were awfully familiar, from their grandfathers joint that just so happens to be down the street.  These two idiots are smug as one could get, I once sat and listened to how he fired someone as he cooked my steak... Yeah sweet you fired someone that needed a job... Their ideas are unoriginal as their food. The place is trendy and if it weren't for their unlimited bankroll would be closed by now. They're even managing to run Salvatore's into the ground... I mean do you hear left bank, providence social, chop house promoting their business on deal chicken or groupon?  No. These two idiots are the worst of the worst and the product they out out at this contemporary lounge is sub par as best. Do yourself a favor stop going to any Resturant these two ( nick and Russ) are apart of.  Ask any employee from either this place or Salvatore's and they will tell you some good stories. Complain about food cost as they comp a ten top of their friends, fire a bus boy for putting a wine glass with lipstick on it on the table, as they  sit on their phones in the middle of the dinner rush. The fish tacos or ok but I'm sure the sushi is from wegmans. Unoriginal and unimaginable.  If these boys had any brass they would open a place in the city, but they don't so what you get is a look at my last name come eat here.  My guess is that they will run this into the ground and their granddaddys place will follow.

Pros: Service, Cesar Salad, Lava Cake Not so con: Tuscan Steak Roulad Is it a good restaurant for kids? No Is it good choice for big groups? No Is the parking lot enough to accommodate the customers? Yes Today, we were looking to go to a restaurant that we never visited to celebrate my wife's birthday. It was around 7:00pm on a restaurant week and I was expecting for a line, but thanks God we didn't get one. The hosts were very nice people and direct us very quickly to the table. The waitress service was very good too and the food did not take so much time to arrive to us. Even to refill the drinks, she was very efficient too. Because it was a restaurant week, I tried the special menu that they prepared for these days. I asked for a Cesar salad, Tuscan Steak Roulad and a Lava Cake. Overall, the quality of the food was very good with the exception of the vegetables and the mashed potatoes. The vegetables presentation was not very good and the mashed potatoes were blend. But I am willing to try again the restaurant because it I liked the experience at all.

Pleasantly surprised! We arrived sort if early at 5pm on Saturday. There was hardly anyone here. Our first impression was this restaurant has way more to offer than the contemporary, mostly painted but bare walls. The table are elegantly set up - just like at Russell's. I made a mistake of only getting the side Caesar salad. It was really good. Crisp and great flavor. I am a salad fanatic and should of had the dinner size! My wife was impressed too. For dinner, I had a side of scallops and Salmon Neptune. My wife had Pecan crusted chicken. My wife liked her chicken dinner. I stoled a piece and it was good. I am not a big fan of maple syrup flavoring on chicken. But the chicken was still very well cooked and tasted good. She said it. Was very delicious, seasoned well and crispy. My scallops were unfortunately bland. I should have known better for a $10 side dish! The Sriracha Sauce was good and made it easy to eat the scallops - if you don't count crying from the heat after the fact!! I really like the punishment though! The salmon was great and cooked to perfection. We will definitely come back again and choose a little more wisely. We came back here for Restaurant Week on 10/24/13. After this meal I still like this restaurant but am lowering my score to 3 out if 5 stars. It seems like they have trouble using proper spices other than pepper and salt. It was very busy and there is a younger crowd tonight.

Though we shared some of the same experiences as noted in "Joseph L."'s review, our conclusion wasn't quite the same. The decor of the restaurant seems a little ... confused.  Is it a bar? Is it a restaurant? On one side there's a bar with some 20- and 30-somethings with a big divider wall separating them from ... the old people.  (Including me.)    In any case, when we finished dinner, we decided the answer to the "bar or restaurant?" question was: probably better off as a bar. I ordered the Filet, my lovely lady ordered the vegetable risotto.  And while I agree with "Joseph L." that my menu choice is circa 1985 (growing up my palate did stop evolving somewhere right after chicken fingers), I do enjoy a big tasty Filet.  What makes a good Filet? I think the answer is pretty well-accepted: a well-cooked, high-quality cut of beef, all by itself on the plate. Simple. Yum!  Except that general rule doesn't apply here.  This otherwise little innocent, perfect cut of meat got drowned  in one of the moldy, pungent (and unfortunate) staples of Buffalo haute cuisine - bleu cheese.    To be fair, evidently the menu DID note that the Filet comes bathed in this - a fact I negligently overlooked when ordering.  (I didn't think my error was really gross negligence to assume the Filet would be presented sans goop given that a Filet is rarely mangled with anything but perhaps a little red wine reduction or some Bernaise on the side.  Slobbering a Filet in cheese seems unusual enough that it might be best if the guest was politely reminded of it when s/he orders?)  When I acted surprised and disappointed when my Filet arrived drenched in mold, our waiter didn't recoil in concern; rather, he offered up a curt disclaimer: "It IS on the menu."   So, he's right, technically I screwed up and didn't see it on the menu, but I didn't really think getting the "it's your fault dude" look was really the best way to handle the situation.   With no offer to fix things, I tried scraping the meat clean and discovered, I suppose not surprisingly, there was a reason why this ostensible prized cut of beef was smothered in something that smells like feet: the meat wasn't great anyway.   Not horrible, but average at best. As for my companion, her drink (a dirty Martini) was decent.  The vegetable risotto was "OK", the flavor being better than the preparation of the risotto, which was on the soupy side.   To be fair, risotto is not the easiest thing to get right. Not a restaurant we'll be going back to, though it may be an enjoyable place to hang out for the younger crowd, especially if you stick to the bar.

food and drinks are always delicious and refreshing. I had a burger tonight, which was cooked perfectly with great bleu cheese a top.  The Basil Patron cocktail is my number 1 choice! Basil Patron, Basil Patron, Basil Patron

I am always looking for new and exciting locations to take my fiancee out to dinner in the Burbs on our date night.  I insist upon a well stocked full bar (beer and wine does not cut it...Sorry Aroma on Main), really good food (Sorry Black and Blue Steakhouse), and a place where my lady friend friend can wear (and be seen) in some of her sexier dressy outfits (Sorry Brennans).  YOLO could potentially fit the bill, but the menu was very lack lustre so I avoided it.  And lets face it the name really sucks...You Only Live Once...in Amherst...really?? However, tired of the same ole places we branched out and gave it a shot.  I should have known I was in a bit of trouble when I saw an overwhelming wave of 60 somethings rocking their Tommy Bahamas when I walked in.  Of course, the mass exodus at 7:30, i.e. bedtime, certainly cleared up some space at the bar. The restaurant does have some potential.  It is a large cavernous space, painted in dark rich blues giving it a modern look.  To call it a lounge though is certainly a misnomer.  The bar is nice and well stocked, with a list of specialty cocktails (it does not even compare though to places like Vera or Aroma on Bryant).  My beautiful lady friend started with the Raspberry Mojito, which was made with muddled raspberries.  It was tasty but waaaay too much pulp...it should have been strained.  However, I went with the "Green with Envy" on the rocks...because Martini glasses are ridiculous.  It was made with vodka, muddled cucumbers, lime juice and simple syrup.  This cocktail was very good, and is highly recommended.    We enjoyed many more after that initial sampling. We started with the spinach and artichoke dip which was very good.  It was made with a hint of gorgonzola cheese which was a unique twist to this ubiquitous dip. For dinner we decided to stray from the main courses because there was NOTHING exciting.  Filet Mignon, Salmon Neptune, Pasta Primavera...what is this 1985??  Instead we went for the sandwiches and were pleasantly surprised.  Lady friend went for the turkey reuben.  Overall it was very tasty, not too greasy but a bit light on the sauerkraut for my taste.  I went with a sandwich I have not had since Bennigans left town...the MONTE CRISTO!!  That's right a deep fried, turkey, ham and swiss sandwich served with strawberry jelly.  Whomever came up with that gem must have been smoking some sticky icky.  While Bennigans was the local king for the Monte Cristo being totally deep fried and crunchy, YOLO's was not bad.  It was more of a French Toast than a completely submerged in boiling oil kind of sandwich.  I think the chef spent a bit too much time griddling the ham and turkey though and they became tough and stringy.  The sandwich was quite tasty though. Do not goto YOLO expecting a modern lounge catering to sexy 30 somethings with great food, which was what I was hoping for and I believe what they were also hoping for.  The crowd is older, the food is bar food at best and the cocktails are decent.  Not bad for a date night, but certainly not my top choice.

I've been here a handful of times; the food and service have been great everytime! I don't think they have a bad item on the menu. The nightlife gets interesting too...not my scene for after hours.

Yum!  Except that general rule doesn't apply here.  This otherwise little innocent, perfect cut of meat got drowned  in one of the moldy, pungent (and unfortunate) staples of Buffalo haute cuisine - bleu cheese.    To be fair, evidently the menu DID note that the Filet comes bathed in this - a fact I negligently overlooked when ordering.  (I didn't think my error was really gross negligence to assume the Filet would be presented sans goop given that a Filet is rarely mangled with anything but perhaps a little red wine reduction or some Bernaise on the side.  Slobbering a Filet in cheese seems unusual enough that it might be best if the guest was politely reminded of it when s/he orders?)  When I acted surprised and disappointed when my Filet arrived drenched in mold, our waiter didn't recoil in concern; rather, he offered up a curt disclaimer: "It IS on the menu."   So, he's right, technically I screwed up and didn't see it on the menu, but I didn't really think getting the "it's your fault dude" look was really the best way to handle the situation.   With no offer to fix things, I tried scraping the meat clean and discovered, I suppose not surprisingly, there was a reason why this ostensible prized cut of beef was smothered in something that smells like feet: the meat wasn't great anyway.   Not horrible, but average at best. As for my companion, her drink (a dirty Martini) was decent.  The vegetable risotto was "OK", the flavor being better than the preparation of the risotto, which was on the soupy side.   To be fair, risotto is not the easiest thing to get right. Not a restaurant we'll be going back to, though it may be an enjoyable place to hang out for the younger crowd, especially if you stick to the bar.
Very good food and atmosphere. Had two specials, rack of lamb and poached salmon and both were excellent. Daughter and her friend had Caesar salad and chicken pesto sandwich, with Mac n cheese substituted for the fries; they both liked it. Waiter, Derik, was excellent; pleasant and good suggestions. Reduced one star from 5 bec calamari app too salty, no prices shown for specials so have to ask (they were reasonable so why not just show price?), and coffee was $3.50, wich was the only item that seemed overpriced. Recommend it and hope they take this constructive criticism as it is intended-to make YOLO even better.
food and drinks are always delicious and refreshing. I had a burger tonight, which was cooked perfectly with great bleu cheese a top.  The Basil Patron cocktail is my number 1 choice! Basil Patron, Basil Patron, Basil Patron
Yolo is a beautiful restaurant but it definitely needs some help with the food and service and satisfying its customers. 10 of us ladies went out to celebrate several birthday's. Unfortunately, it is not a place I would go back to for a number of reasons. Half of us liked our food but several of us did not. The haddock for two of us was not good. Someone else said their fish was overcooked. My mash potatoes were dry and not tasty. The caprese stack was not good at all. Why wouldn't you use good tomatoes and buffalo mozzarella - for 9 dollars!!! Our server told us that we could substitute our sides for any of the other sides listed. So many of us did substitute - only to find out that every single change for another side was CHARGED!  We were not told this and when we said something, we were told by the server that a substitution fee was listed on the menu!  I asked to speak to an owner and we were all beside ourselves that we got charged extra for mac and cheese, green beans, asparagus for our sides. The owner came over and after reviewing the bill said "sorry ladies. The bill is correct and it was listed on our menu as you will be charged". So, apparently 10 of us did not see this fine print at the bottom! And the server knew it was two people's birthday and like every restaurant I have been to in my life, a candle is put in the desert. And that did not happen. So for 10 women, our experience was negative. I suggest to the young owner, that saying what he did was not a way to satisfy customers. I think you easily can say "here is a coupon for next time, or lets take 10 percent off the bill, or would you like some coffee for free".  You really let 10 of us walk out in anger? I was beside myself.  This place will not make it. When you are cocky, you can't make it in this business. As for "you only live once", this will not be the place I make as part of future plans!
I am always looking for new and exciting locations to take my fiancee out to dinner in the Burbs on our date night.  I insist upon a well stocked full bar (beer and wine does not cut it...Sorry Aroma on Main), really good food (Sorry Black and Blue Steakhouse), and a place where my lady friend friend can wear (and be seen) in some of her sexier dressy outfits (Sorry Brennans).  YOLO could potentially fit the bill, but the menu was very lack lustre so I avoided it.  And lets face it the name really sucks...You Only Live Once...in Amherst...really?? However, tired of the same ole places we branched out and gave it a shot.  I should have known I was in a bit of trouble when I saw an overwhelming wave of 60 somethings rocking their Tommy Bahamas when I walked in.  Of course, the mass exodus at 7:30, i.e. bedtime, certainly cleared up some space at the bar. The restaurant does have some potential.  It is a large cavernous space, painted in dark rich blues giving it a modern look.  To call it a lounge though is certainly a misnomer.  The bar is nice and well stocked, with a list of specialty cocktails (it does not even compare though to places like Vera or Aroma on Bryant).  My beautiful lady friend started with the Raspberry Mojito, which was made with muddled raspberries.  It was tasty but waaaay too much pulp...it should have been strained.  However, I went with the "Green with Envy" on the rocks...because Martini glasses are ridiculous.  It was made with vodka, muddled cucumbers, lime juice and simple syrup.  This cocktail was very good, and is highly recommended.    We enjoyed many more after that initial sampling. We started with the spinach and artichoke dip which was very good.  It was made with a hint of gorgonzola cheese which was a unique twist to this ubiquitous dip. For dinner we decided to stray from the main courses because there was NOTHING exciting.  Filet Mignon, Salmon Neptune, Pasta Primavera...what is this 1985??  Instead we went for the sandwiches and were pleasantly surprised.  Lady friend went for the turkey reuben.  Overall it was very tasty, not too greasy but a bit light on the sauerkraut for my taste.  I went with a sandwich I have not had since Bennigans left town...the MONTE CRISTO!!  That's right a deep fried, turkey, ham and swiss sandwich served with strawberry jelly.  Whomever came up with that gem must have been smoking some sticky icky.  While Bennigans was the local king for the Monte Cristo being totally deep fried and crunchy, YOLO's was not bad.  It was more of a French Toast than a completely submerged in boiling oil kind of sandwich.  I think the chef spent a bit too much time griddling the ham and turkey though and they became tough and stringy.  The sandwich was quite tasty though. Do not goto YOLO expecting a modern lounge catering to sexy 30 somethings with great food, which was what I was hoping for and I believe what they were also hoping for.  The crowd is older, the food is bar food at best and the cocktails are decent.  Not bad for a date night, but certainly not my top choice.
Our party decided to try YOLO on a Friday night. We were politely greeted. Despite having made reservations and the place quite empty, we were led to seating in a less desirable area, overlooking the parking lot, on that rainy night. We asked to be seated in the main area and were obliged. The server was pleasant and knowledgeable although didn't take cues about not wanting more drinks or any appetizers, coffee or dessert. Heavy on the sales and opinions. The food was OK, nicely presented, but did not quite match the snooty atmosphere. The grilled chicken pesto sandwich was all right, but lacking in pesto! (It may have even been spinach.) The grilled chicken was rather dry, the homemade mashed potatoes had a very interesting flavor, intense peppering, but the presentation was lacking, a pile of gloppy, discolored spuds with no potato texture, spoon worthy even. I just couldn't bring myself to eat something so, well, ugly. The house drink, YOLO cocktail, was quite refreshing, the wine ordinary, the beer selection interesting. The chicken dumpling soup was unexpectedly cream-based, not served piping hot, although flavorful and filling. It was more like a stoop (that's a combination of stew and soup!), something you could eat with a fork. It came with a sliver of julianne-sliced white bread and a small bowl of butter. The fish had an interesting flavor, in fact, I'd say all the dishes had an interesting flavor. But I was surprised that in a place like this, the fish came with "seasoned" fries (just like you'd get at a burger joint) AND macaroni salad. The sandwiches also came with seasoned fries, although the server pushed for substituting - for an additional charge - with other sides instead...kind of odd, just offer the other sides. As for the atmosphere, it's just blah, kind of cold (as in not warm and cozy) and dark, and rather moody feeling. The air of pretentiousness was significant.  The crowd was of mixed ages, mainly the "mature" audience, not a particularly youthful place. Although it was not a bad experience, I wouldn't choose to return; if I wanted an elegant place with awesome everything, I'd go to Rick's on Main or any number of other restaurants. This place, YOLO, just didn't do it for me or my party.
I've been here a handful of times; the food and service have been great everytime! I don't think they have a bad item on the menu. The nightlife gets interesting too...not my scene for after hours.
Food is great. Staff is very friendly and bill at the bar is great.  Awesome burgers. Get the sunny side up with bacon.

I came here with my boyfriend for dinner on Valentine's Day, after family recommended we dine here after their recent visit. We weren't familiar with its location, besides that it was down Transit Road in East Amherst.  Upon arrival, we were a little surprised to find it's location in a strip plaza with other businesses varying from clothing stores to beauty salons.  We were told this place was more modern and upscale, I kind of expected something different I guess.  After entering, our predictions were further contradicted.  The overall feel and atmosphere was not anticipated.  It was very open, cold, and reminded me of a gymnasium the way it was painted and because of the ceiling.  It was one large room, which was divided into a bar and a dining area by a single half wall, running the restaurant's entire length.  It just felt like they were trying to be modern and ultra chic, but couldn't properly deliver that vibe to its guests.   Trying not to focus on the ambiance anymore, we sat at the bar for a drink prior to being seated for our dining reservation.  Both bartenders we encountered were very friendly and accommodating.  We were seated shortly after and greeted by our waitress.  We already viewed the menu at the bar and knew what we wanted to order.  We started off with the Calamari Diavolo, which was "lightly breaded and seasoned fresh calamari, sprinkled with parmesan cheese and served with a spicy marinara sauce".  We are both avid calamari fans, and this dish definitely topped my list for one of the best calamari appetizers I have had around town.  For dinner, I had the chicken Caesar salad because I can never eat much of an entrée after indulging in an appetizer.  The salad was up to par with a chicken Caesar salad that I would expect from this type of restaurant....nothing over the top, but still good.  My boyfriend had the Black and Blue Angus Burger.  I don't eat hamburgers so I didn't try this, but he seemed to be quite pleased.  What I did try of his though was the sweet potato fries, and those were delicious!!! We were both very pleased with the food and the service; however I am big on making sure I love the mood and the ambiance of where I wine and dine, and this place just didn't cut it.  I particularly like to take my dining travels mostly throughout various neighborhoods in the city; so to get me to come to the suburbs I have to really like a place.  I wouldn't go out of my way to return to YOLO, but if in the area I may stop in for a quick drink and enjoy some calamari at the bar, as opposed to dining in the dining room.

Dining room  staff was very attentive and  food was good quality.  However, I waited over 15 minutes to be served at the bar and the bar wasn't crowded.  The man and woman  staffing the bar completely ignored us and finally we spoke up and said, "Can we get a drink?"  Very substandard service.  I won't be returning, being ignored is inexcusable.  There are enough other restaurants around the Buffalo area that actually wait on you.

Weekly Friday evening stop. Great drinks, best French fries in town every single time, don't know how they do it. Bartenders are awesome, service is great, food is always good and very personal attention.

Been here many times, never had a bad experience.  Their happy hour is great, and the bartenders are awesome.  Always very prompt to fill your glass, and many great drinks on their menu.  The strip steak sandwich is great and they always have a ton of great specials.  I highly recommend sitting on the patio to eat while the summer is still here!

I went to YOLO with a group of wonderful, professional women. When the waiter went around the table explaining that the fish came with three sides and, you can substitute  out, we liked that. He never mentioned that all those substitutes came at an extra price. When we received the bill and saw all the extra cost we called over the waiter. He prompltly said, "It's written right on the menu".   We also told the owner who said, "Oh, I apologize". That's it. Guess what? Those nine women will tell their friends, their friends will tell their friends, etc. They made a big mistake that night. A simple comment like, "you can substitute for an extra cost", would have been appreciated.

Food is always fantastic and the drinks are right priced.  I love the the sunny side burger but make sure you get it with bacon.  Cus there is always room for bacon.

We've become regulars here. Active owner, friendly staff, good food, prices and atmosphere.  What else would you want?
