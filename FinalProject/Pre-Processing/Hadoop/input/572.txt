This is for all you Capital District activist leftists out there! I recently went to see a documentary and discussion on Labor Politics at this place, which really a volunteer run and operated Media/Arts space. A offshoot of the of the Hudson Mohawk Independent Media Center, the Sanctuary is an excellent space to see one of the movies in their current Â fall series. To quote the website...."The Sanctuary for Independent Media is a telecommunications production facility dedicated to community media arts, located in an historic former church at 3361 6th Avenue in north Troy, NY. The Sanctuary hosts screening, production and performance facilities, training in media production and a meeting space for artists, activists and independent media makers of all kinds." Not only does this place have a "suggested donation," to their events, they have student/low income category as well. And the 1 dollar bag of freshly popped popcorn out of the kettle is the BOMB!
