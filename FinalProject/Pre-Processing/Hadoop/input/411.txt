I have been going there in past three years and Billy is my go to person when I have issues with stiffness in my neck, shoulder and back. Since I found him, I have not tried other therapists.   The place is small with two cozy treatment rooms. The atmosphere is very warm and welcoming. You can truly relax and enjoy massage without distraction. The price is reasonable and I always get a package deal.  He also offers many promotion deals including facials and other body services.
