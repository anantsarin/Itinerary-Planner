My best friend hyped and raved about JJ's A LOT so when I stumbled upon this place after a pleasant dinner next door with my siblings, I was most definitely excited!! I live in Long Island and there is not a JJ's nearby at all. The shop looked quite desolate with only one customer at a booth but it was pretty late at night. I ordered the Beach Club and asked if they could toast the bread. No can do. What? Awman. :( A little bit miffed, I paid for the sandwich and as soon as I got back to my brother's house, I immediately turned on the stove, heating up a pan to a low heat. Yep. I toasted the sammie myself. That was just a *bit* annoying. Then I saddled the complete sammie on a plate and voila! bit.ly/14F15fB Yay, I still couldn't wait to bite in! bit.ly/16PzD1x This delectable sammie included turkey breast, avocado spread, cucumber, cheese, lettuce, tomato & mayo. The whole wheat bread was nice and thick. It was decent but nothing jaw-dropping amazing. It was a good sandwich though....a sandwich I could make myself...and I almost did. Jeez. Ehh. No matter how many sparkles and rainbows thrown at me, it was pretty much just an average joe sandwich.

It's been -years- since I'd last been to Jimmy John's.  Having gone to undergrad in Evanston, I remember all-too-frequently late-night meals here while working on one team project or another at ITEC (nee BIRL). It's only appropriate that my most recent Jimmy John's visit was similarly with age-old college buddies, also engineering majors, and for a quick grub-and-go bite en route from one adventure to the next. Admittedly, I don't typically get stoked about going to a chain sandwicherie (unless it's Potbelly), but I'd forgotten just how much I liked Jimmy John's subs.  I mean... for the price, it's a pretty good deal.  If you're a meatophile like I am, you're likely to also love the #9 - it's chock full of salami, capicola, and ham.  And take their suggestion of adding hot peppers.  With plain oil and vinegar, it's adds a nice little kick to the sandwich. Bright, clean, and airy... they either don't intend to do high traffic here, or people just grab-and-go, because seating's pretty limited.  Definitely smaller than the Evanston shop I'm used to.  Still, the decor's just as smart-ass and saucy as I remember; it's just my style!
I've dismissed this place as just another chain Subways or Quiznos for the longest time until I was told I was making a terrible assumption, it's actually really great for grabbing a quick, cheap and tasty sub sandwich. The 8'' sandwiches are a bit on the small side if your getting a normal sized one but its certainly delicious, who would of thought something as simple as a ham and cheese sandwich could be so good on a simple french bread. Start simple with the Pepe and work your way up. Best thing about this place is they deliver late too but running in and grabbing a sandwich takes less than 3 minutes. Win.

Sandwiches are super FAST most of the time. If you are in a hurry and lazy, these are the way to go. In fact you probably already ordered and have your sandwich before you even read this review. Lot of bread and lettuce, not a lot of meat, which is paper thin. Sandwiches usually made the same, but sometimes vary on level of condiments - sometimes they forget the mayo (or maybe they put way too much on sometimes and very little other times). With all that lettuce and little meat, sometimes I feel like I am eating Still I eat there once a week!

Not my favorite sub and for the price not the biggest nor does it have the most ingredients. But for $5.75 delivered to my work in usually under 25 minutes this cannot be beat. I love the flavor of the sub don't get me wrong but if I had time to run to Wegmans let me tell you I would. This place is great when you've got 30 mins for lunch and no time to pick anything up. They are FAST and the subs are good but like I said a little pricey. It works out in my mind though because they don't charge for delivery. So if the $5.75 sub was only worth $4.50 in my opinion I am paying $1.25 to have it delivered which justifies the purchase every time. I've ordered countless times from then for lunch at work and continue to do so and will continue to do so as they are the best for a quick lunch at work!

In-store service is very good, never long wait for the sandwich, it is often done by the time you have paid and walked to the pick-up window. Deliver service is very unreliably and often awful. Their "freaky fast" service must only apply to the sandwich-making process because delivery often takes over 40 minutes to arrive.

Awesome little sandwich shop! Fresh bread, delicious fresh ingredients, and cheap too! Very courteous staff. Also very cool that they deliver. Even one sandwitch!

It's shocking when the sub shows up from across town five minutes after you get off the phone with them. Their delivery is fast. The subs themselves kind of suck but it's hard to complain when they only costs $5 and the phone people and delivery people are great.
I came here about 4-5 years ago and I remember it being really good. Its deffinitly better then subway. Next time I'm in Ithaca I'm going to stop here again and I will update my review. I live on Long Island and there are none down here :'/
