Petrune is a lovely (and large!) vintage clothing store on the Ithaca Commons. They carry a well-curated range of 20th-century finds for both men and women (see especially their shoes and accessories), with the occasional Victorian piece. Petrune also carries modern interpretations of vintage styles, and I believe they've recently begun manufacturing dresses based on vintage patterns. Definitely worth a look-in if you're passing through the Finger Lakes region. Prices are uber-reasonable.
I have gotten some of my favorite vintage pieces of all time from here. Love this store! It's definitely on the pricey side though... But worth it because the clothes are well made.
Petrune is a well-stocked vintage clothing store on the Commons, in a new, enlarged space that replaced its previous location around the corner on Cayuga Street. Petrune mostly stocks women's clothes, accessories, and shoes, but it also has a pretty good men's selection as well. Prices are reasonable and there is often a small themed discount section outside the store, featuring something like houndstooth jackets or eighties dresses. The shop is a great addition to the Commons and is worth a visit if you're in Ithaca. update, 2.20.09: Volume Records just opened a location in Petrune, on the upper floor. I haven't been to see it yet, but an employee at Volume said that it contains their vinyls. Sounds like a cool collaboration to me.
An ok consignment store that has more vintage stuff than Trader K but also more expensive prices. Think the only thing I've bought at the store were a pair of pants that happened to be the right size
Their window display caught my eyes and upon remembering this place from years ago, went inside. I saw some dresses that are my style. But gosh, the employees are SNOTTY. Walked out .
Pricey, very much so. In other word's it's the kind of place that sells sweaters for 70 dollars and up, get my drift?. When I was in the store the women who worked there wernt friendly the least bit and never asked where I was trying to go in the store to look for something particular like a mens hat, I had to find it myself which isn't a problem, I was just in a rush to pick up something for a friend I was meeting in 15 min and considering that I  had never been in the store before that day, it was annoying to have to search all over myself for the mens section with no help/direction. I do however very much like thier assortment of vintage headphones which are upstairs--the headphones are very hip and the only thing that's affordable (25-60.00)
Great store! They buy some of the awesome vintage stuff that you take in, and have a large place with some wonderful clothes!  If they had more men's stuff, I would stop in more often.
Extremely over priced! I'd rather shop online.  I get the same stuff 75% less :) The place is cute but the clothing is not worth the price. I'd pay $200 for a dress but not anything they sell.  They sell old vintage style dresses and coats nothing worth their prices. I can go to a thrift store and get vintage style dresses and coats for super cheap. you aren't gonna get your money's worth at this store!
The men's section isn't big, but there are some pretty sweet deals hiding in there. I got a really nice wool blazer for just 25 dollars. There are tuxedos, ties, shirts and coats that all looked great and we were surprised that nobody mentioned this place to us. Definitely worth checking out if you're looking for some nice formal wear or fall-winter coats!
Petrune is definitely on the pricier side, which is both surprising and unsurprising (surprising because a lot of the clothes they sell are just modern pieces based on vintage styles, and unsurprising because... well, it's a vintage/consignment store, duh). At any rate, you can find a ton of great modern 20's and 30's style pieces there. In particular, their coats and party dresses are divine (though way out of my budget!). Also, although it leaves much to be desired, Petrune has a small selection of clothes with thrift store prices. (Last spring, I managed to find a nice wool A-line skirt and a cheap flannel that I wear all the time when it gets cold.) If you have money to spend, or if you're just looking for eye candy, Petrune is worth a visit for sure.
Petrune used to be my favorite vintage store, and I looked forward to going there every time I was in Ithaca. So I was extremely disappointed when I went there recently and saw how much the store had changed, and I won't be returning. Petrune used to be primarily a vintage store, with some consignment clothes. Now, almost the whole store is filled with their "Petrunia" brand clothes, which I found extremely underwhelming. The rest of the store is consignment items; there were only a couple vintage items, and they weren't anywhere near as fun or unique as the vintage items I used to find there. It looks like they're now selling all of the vintage clothes on their website, and won't let shoppers in the store try them on even though, according to the sales person, they are stored in the basement. The sales person told me it was because they were fragile and mainly for display purposes. For the record, the clothes I was interested in trying on were described on the website as in "beautiful condition," "excellent condition," "fabulous condition," etc. Seems like a pretty big discrepancy to me. Also, when I tried to get help, I was initially ignored by the store's only employee, who was discussing movies with a friend who was browsing there. Overall, I was so excited to go to Petrune since it had been a while, but it was like going into a completely different store. My advice, don't bother.
I'm a voracious hoarder of vintage clothing. That being said, I love this place! They carry very carefully picked vintage pieces as well as newer designers, sometimes vintage inspired. I was surprised to have purchased a new dress and I even tried on jeans, also new. There wasn't a thing in there I didn't love. Shoes, sunglasses, would've liked to see more handbags but they had a great collection of summery straw bags. Being from NYC, I didn't find their prices terribly high at all. I bought a dress, sunglasses and shoes all for about $75. Sales persons were friendly and helpful as well. I'd definitely return next time I'm in the area.
Eh... Okay, so I used to love this place, back in the day when it was an actual vintage shop. These days, it seems like everything they have is quite pricey and the merchandise isn't that great. Plus, now the upstairs is quite empty. They used to have men's merchandise and women's sale items but we headed upstairs to find piles of cardboard boxes and a basket of men's ties; that made me sad. Most recently, I picked up a knee-length wool plaid skirt for under $20 (they had an entire rack of long plaid wool skirts) which admittedly was an excellent deal. However, the rest of the store was stocked with things that didn't really interest me. Also, they have drawers with belts and gloves and hosiery but they are so disorganized. Many of the gloves were in horrible condition (either dirty or mangled or both) and the belts were all tangled up in each other. I feel like I could've found a nice belt but I was so put off by the mess and I didn't have the energy to rifle through the pile. They also have merchandise in the "storage area" that hasn't been priced yet so it isn't for sale but that was really off-putting to me. It was such a tease to see some nice items and not be able to buy them. Maybe the owners see that as a way of giving people an incentive to come back (like, "Ooh, look at what we might have for sale next week,") but since I was only in town for the weekend, I was definitely turned off. And even if I was still in school, I'd be peeved since it's not like I was able to make time to head to the commons all that often while I was still a student. All in all, it's a fun place to peruse but and I'll always come back since it offers me a lot of nostalgia.
