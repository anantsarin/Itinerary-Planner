Excellent Farmers Market!   Upsides: Wide variety of fresh produce, bakery items, ready made food, flowers, wines, arts & crafts. Everything is recyclable/compostable - no plastic bags or plasticware for food. Excellent deals on perennials & produce (if don't stop at the first/biggest stand you see - walk around).  Live music on Saturdays. Waterview eating & places for the kids to run around. Shopping area is completely covered so it's a terrific rain/snow destination. Downsides: parking is a huge headache. Best to park far (like at Aldi) & walk for the amount of time it takes to find a spot & leave a spot when you're done! Not many covered eating spots when it's raining. Also, the walk up is MUDDY; don't forget your boots! Note: Trumansburg FM has a more hippie/laid back feel if that's what you're looking for (but it's all outside).

Was upstate one weekend and this place was recommended to us. I love the set up. It's like half outdoor half indoor. Very clean and inviting. There's not that many vendors but enough to keep you company for a good couple hours. The produce were colorful and fresh. There were many choices for food too. They had cuban food, asian food, nepalese food. I had the lime noodles and yes it was very good. Lots of pastries as well. Apple cider donuts galore and warm apple cider to drink. There were a good number of local wines too and lots of wine tasting! Also a hard cider vendor. Prices were just as steep as the farmers market in New York City, I thought it would be cheaper upstate. Worth checking out, a beautiful place to spend your saturday morning at.

Great place to buy locally grown produce and quite a unique selection of local crafts and other products. The vendors have a large selection of different seasonal veggies and fruits (seemingly more of the former), plus there are other specialty food vendors who have things like honey, bison meat, hard cider, and many other products. There are several vendors offering coffee and various hot foods made to order, so go hungry if you want to try some of the local fare. Be forewarned that the line can get quite long at some of the popular stalls, especially those serving breakfast burritos. By time they open in the morning, there are usually at least 10-15 people in line, so arrive early if this is your intention. A few other notes: - The vendors accept only cash, though there is a fee-charging ATM on the premesis (unless you are a member of Alternatives Federal Credit Union) - It really helps to bring your own bags or baskets in which to place your produce. Many of the vendors offer bags, but bring your own to reduce costs. - Parking is a bit tricky because it's difficult to tell where there may be spots available. If it's super busy you may have to park a way down the road and walk in. But, it's worth looping around the entire parking area to see if someone has vacated a spot near the market.

Loved everything about this market! Got some really fresh bell peppers and amazing cherry tomatoes. The produce was incredible. Bought homemade multigrain bread! Yum yum. Got the breakfast burrito that was delicious. I cherished each bite. Also got the Cambodian food. It was so tasty and hardy. Worth every penny. It is a must try! Lastly I got the bison hot sausages. Oh man! Cooked it up later with all my fresh veggies and it was delicious. The taste of the bison was amazing. Definitely should buy it! Can't wait to go back.
This was one of the best farmer's market that I have been to. The market has great selections of fresh produce from local farmers, beautiful flower bouquets, pastries, and fresh prepared food. Cambodian food stall was excellent. I have ordered banana fried like almost everyone else and it was wonderful. Information for dog owners: dogs are not allowed in the main market. However, in the back of the market (close to the river), there are lots of open space for people to bring their dogs to and tables for everyone to picnic.

Decent Farmers Market with plenty of ecclectic and exotic choices for shopping and eating. They also have live music and the line for food is not too overwhelming. We spent an hour or so looking around and trying different items and it was a nice place to stop by. Not sure if you need more than that amount of time here, but definitely come with an appetite because there are tons of choices here!

A top tier farmers market in produce, street food, and crafts. Tucked away in a wall-less cathedral this farmers market caters to those that want to explore new things; upstate wines, Thai fussion, local honey, gourmet mushrooms, and heavy glaze potters. They really have so much to offer. Browse the wears and grab lunch on a bench overlooking the glassy lake to take in the view.

You don't "shop" the Ithaca Farmer's Market, you nibble, snack and munch your way from one end to the other LOL!  Deep-fried bananas in a mild sweet chili sauce for just $3?  Why yes, I will have that amazing snack from the Cambodian food stall.  Add a fine cup of coffee and it doesn't get much better on a cold morning. Six stars for this enormous covered market's produce, coffee, bread, pastry, cheese, meat, hot food, jewelry, wine, cider, crafts and art, not to mention friendly chatty vendors.  Forty years old and going strong, maybe it's not really a hundred yards long but it felt like it, two hours there slipped away like nothing.   BYOB - that means bring your own bag :) The produce was so clean, shiny and appealing I swear it looked like every piece was ready for a photo shoot.  On this Fall Saturday fresh apples were everywhere, at least a dozen varieties including some really interesting heirlooms. Plenty of kale, greens and root veggies too.  Produce was maybe 1/3 of the vendors. The wood-fired oven people were cranking out pizzas about 1/16" thick that were crispy yet chewy, irresistible at any time of day, just $7. Back at Cambodian Foodz I gave in to temptation yet again and got a banh chév, an enormous pancake filled with rice noodles, fresh basil, ground pork and other spicy goodness, basically a southeast Asian burrito, awesomely yummy, a big meal for $7. Bring cash, if you're like me it melts away like snow.  Take your food to the wood benches by the water and admire the tail end of Cayuga lake.  The market is so immensely popular that parking is *tough*, ride a bike if you can manage it.  Conveniently located behind the local sewage treatment plant :) Different vendors Saturdays and Sundays, I'm told Saturdays are more food and Sundays are more art.  Super long season, this market opens about April 1 and closes about December 21.

Been to numerous farmer's markets and this may be one of my favorites. It's adorable w the wooden vendor stalls and a roof covering it all along Cayuga lake. Art, food vendors, wine and cheese samples, flowers..free parking in dirt lot parking attendants directing traffic.

The Ithaca Farmer's market is pretty much the farmer's market to end all farmer's market. It's in a covered patio right on Cayuga lake and has a LOT of vendors ranging from vegetables, wines, fruits, eggs, clothing, handmade cutting boards, fresh coffee, and delicious "cart" food. They have organic produce and conventionally grown produce, all quite local and very fresh. The vendors are very nice and will tell you how things are grown, how to cook things, and even what some strange look vegetables are! The ready-to-eat food there is all delicious and make sure you stop at the Cambodian place if it's lunchtime. My fiance and I usually get the vegetarian tofu option and it's delicious - with a little bit of sweet from the pineapple and then spicy from the chili. If the weather is nice, you can sit and eat on the benches on the water and sometimes there is live music or activities at the park. If it's chilly though, bundle up, because even in the early fall it can get quite cold under that cover without the sun shining down! The farmer's markets truly showcases some of the best of what Ithaca has to offer, so enjoy!

Go to the breakfast burrito place and get yourself the large one. You're gonna love it and gulp down the whole thing!

I had to run some errands this morning and happened to be near the farmer's market so I thought I'd check it out and get some food. There are lots of little food vendors here in addition to produce stands and local artwork vendors. My friend told me it's more fun to check this place out before it starts getting cold but it's Ithaca so that window is rather small if you're just here for the school year. According to the site, they do keep the market open all year though and just change venues by season. Given the interesting food selections here, I might just brave the cold and check it out in the winter. The parking lot is rather small and you may spend the first ten minutes or so just driving around or stuck behind someone. The market itself isn't all that big either compared to some of the farmer's markets I've seen back home but it does have lots of interesting options - fruits, vegetables, meats, flowers, wood work, and other goodies. The three places I noticed with long lines are Solaz (breakfast burritos), Veronika's (crepes), and Khmer Angkor (Cambodian). The line for Khmer Angkor looked like it was moving the quickest so I decided to try that one out. I got the chicken amok, which cost $7 for a fairly small tray of rice topped with the chicken. There's an option to switch to brown rice for $0.50 if you prefer that. They provide plenty of curry to go with the rice so it won't be dry but also not too much to make it overflow in the little tray. I also got the fried bananas - three pieces for $2.75. They give you those with some sauce but they're pretty good as is. My only complaint is that the price could go down a bit since it's not that big. On the opposite side of the market is the waterfront. There are some benches and tables where you can take your food and eat, which I did do for a while when the rain momentarily stopped. The waterfront looks like it would make a nice walk too, even on a chilly day like today, but unfortunately the rain picked back up so I didn't get a chance to really check it out. The produce is a bit pricier than what you would see at a supermarket but it does support the local economy, so at least you're contributing to the community. Perhaps next time I'll try the crepes and the breakfast burritos. I couldn't stick around very long because it started raining pretty hard and I needed to get back to running some errands. I did have enough time to walk through the whole place though and it definitely seems like a place I'll come back to.

What a fun spot!! Fresh produce, jewelry, baby clothes, copious ethic eateries... this is so much more than your average farmer's market! The structure this is held in is absolutely gorgeous with ample parking, and you can duck behind the market to enjoy your noshes at the benches that are placed aside the water. There are beautiful flowers and herbs available. Reasonable and friendly vendors willing to negotiate were passionate about their products. Compost bins next to the trash were an awesome touch. If i lived nearby, I'd likely be here every weekend. Couldn't get to 5 stars because it was uncomfortably crowded, only open on Saturdays, long bathroom lines, and I couldn't find a bottle or cup of water in any of the vendors' booths. It was IC graduation weekend so the crowds may have been heavier than usual - I'm not sure. Totally worth checking out - just make sure you leave yourself some time so you can enjoy all there is to offer! (Update: someone messaged me to say that the Farmer's Market is open on Sundays and another day in a different location - check before you go)

I live in PA, but visit friends in the Ithaca area a few times a year.  I'm a big fan of a few farmers markets close to my home, but I wish I could pick up the Ithaca Farmers Market and bring it back home with me. In my experience, farmers markets either have lots of produce and not much else, or there are more crafty/homemade items and skimp on the food options.  But Ithaca Farmers Market has it all - tons of gorgeous produce, lots of great meat products, some of the prettiest cut flowers I've ever seen, pottery and other hand-crafted items (I have an awesome necklace from one vendor) and perhaps my favorite feature - some of the most impressive offering of prepared foods I've ever seen at a farmers market. The first thing I do whenever I get there is head straight for the Cambodian food stand for an order of sticky rice with coconut milk and mango.  It's usually steaming hot and so deliciously sweet and drippy and the rice has just the right about of bite to it.  I've also had delicious treats from Fat Boy (anything they have with almond in it = amazing), Macro Mama's, Veronika's Pastries (both their savory and sweet crepes are good) and Solaz (their breakfast burritos are so good and make that whole end of the market smell awesome).

We visited this farmer's market on a Sunday in September. It wasn't very big, which surprised me. I don't know why I was expecting it to be larger or grander, but it was very modest in size and large on charm. Little tealights draped under the wooden ceiling beams, giving it a decidedly holiday feel despite the non-holiday time of year. I didn't buy any produce, but all of it was local and fresh-appearing. The price tags were high, but likely worth it. Our coffees were $3 each and many of the lunch dishes at the international food vendors were between $8-10. This market's strength lies in its quality. I wouldn't go here to save money! We headed to the Cambodian food stall based on previous recommendations and tried the chicken amok, a slightly sweet Cambodian peanut-infused curry with a generous dose of fire. I would definitely recommend this dish to anyone not afraid of a little bit of spice. We also tried some fried sesame balls filled with bean paste -- they were fabulous! I had to go back for a second one. They were my favorite for sure. Another stall we visited was one that boasted some tantalizing pastries (the crepe stall), but the pastries themselves were somewhat average. We had a nice wander around the market and enjoyed the emphasis on fresh quality local produce, but I'm slightly embarrassed to say I was a tad underimpressed. Sometimes reading reviews beforehand can spoil you! The Rochester Public Market doesn't have as many fresh local vendors, but it's 10 times the size and the food stalls are cheaper. The markets in Seattle, Montreal, Toronto, Philadelphia - all better. But it's silly to compare some of North America's best public markets to this farm fresh offering in Ithaca. Definitely check it out, it's worth it!

I was in town to visit my sister at her college and she suggested we visit this market. I am so glad she did! I absolutely loved this place. Plenty of food choices, lots to see and buy, and the cider tastings were a highlight. Plus you can buy something tasty to eat and drink and sit out and look at the water. I went during the last weekend in September, and it got packed quickly. I recommend arriving before 10am in order to get a parking spot and get first dibs on items. Just one con: Because many places are cash only, I was forced to use the generic ATM, however, it was broken. So I was stuck having to leave and not buy some things I wanted to. So make sure to bring cash with you!

The Ithacan Farmers' Market is different than that of any other. Ithaca being what Ithaca is - a crunchy granola, aging hippie and highly educated enclave of artists, farmers, educators and small business people -- it's nothing short of wonderful. Located at Steamboat Landing in the summer, the market pavilion has about 150 stalls of foodie wonders. The craziness starts in the labyrinth of a parking lot, in which you should consider bribing some hipster mom with a decaf skinny latte if you want her parking spot. Once you've secured a spot to stash your gas-guzzler, meander around to the main entrance point of the large pavilion. In addition to fruit, veggie, and gorgeous flower stalls, prepare to be tempted with Cambodian, Indian, Thai, French (the crepes are a must), baked goods, coffee, wine, crafts, and more. What I love most about the market are the men and women who man their stalls with pride as they sell their goods. They're often equally as enthusiastic as the customers, and if they bring the same zest to their farms as they do to the market, you know the products are top notch. Even if you do end up buying stuff at the market at a slightly higher rate than you would pay at my beloved Wegmans or your beloved Wal-Mart (just kidding), you're also supporting local agriculture and our local economy, not to mention the reduced environmental impact of food that doesn't have to travel thousands of miles to get to your table. Okay, lecture over. Just go check it out!

Spectacular farmers market.  If it's happening, it's crowded.  Many vendors of food, natural textiles, art and handmade country wares.  The independent farmer and creative mind can be found here pedaling their hand crafted goods.   Worth a stop whenever you can.    "Be a Hero, Buy Local."

I've been here once but as a Californian, I'm freaking amazed. Around southern cali (at least if your not in THE CITY of LA), there isn't really a thing called a farmer's market. Sure we have our weekly markets-- with 6 - 7stands and about two are actually selling produce. So yeah, this was amazing. There were several people selling seasonal produce (RAMPS which do not exist here) and I was amazed that there were oils, cheese, and fresh meat. Fresh meat! That's blasphemous in small cities outside of Los Angeles. They had amazing fresh foods and an assortment of gifty items like stationary and jewelry. Some amazing people as well-- a man who carved a wooden bowl (which I wanted to buy but he said no boo haha), a little lady with a Bernese, the cheese shop which I later binged on and bought 2 lbs of cheese (half of which I couldn't finish), and a Berkeley man who hand-adjusted a leather bracelet for me. I must get in contact with that bracelet man-- he sells leather belts and bracelets and things. If anyone is in Ithaca please let me know! I would love to go back again, but I transferred back home to CA and now I'm stuck a world apart. This market is 100% recommended.
I've been here once but as a Californian, I'm freaking amazed. Around southern cali (at least if your not in THE CITY of LA), there isn't really a thing called a farmer's market.

People are religious about the breakfast burritos available here, but I say skip them and go straight for the Greek Euros. Not only will your serving be bigger, you'll also get lamb, and what could be more awesome than lamb? Breakfast shouldn't be in burrito-form anyway. I spend my Sundays here sucking in local music, sunshine, yellow cherries and hobby art. Good spot for finding local honey and fresh lemonade. There is also very high ratio of exceptionally good climbing-trees overlooking the water. Get to one before the children do. UPDATE to this post: I am officially sold on the breakfast burritos. My favourites: frijoles negros and calabacitas. Nothing better than warm beans or corn in a crispy tortilla with melted cheese.

Jesus, Ithaca. Are you kidding me? Your farmer's market is like a cornucopia of tasty foods, farm fresh eggs, meats, cheeses, veggies. Throw in a few artists, hippie vendors, braids, attractive college students, the beautiful lake in the background ... and. Is this what heaven is like? Maybe if the prices were a little lower, but seriously...you won't get any other complaints from me. Visiting here almost makes me want to rethink my whole lifestyle. I don't even have the words. I don't have any pro tips because I'm not local to the area, but whoever suggested getting the chicken amogh at the "Cambodia Foodz" stand was spot on and was my hero for that day. Spicy, flavorful, peanuts, yum. I also got one of the veggie pie things there and felt like I was eating a big ball of healthy awesomeness. I was just visiting for a day, so I didn't have the desire to haul back produce, spoilable meats, etc back to Buffalo, but dang...if only I lived nearby. Duck eggs, buffalo meat, fresh veggies interspersed with food stands serving all sorts of foods (crepes, burritos, sushi, Cambodian goodness, cuban, etc..you name it!) along with dessert vendors and bakers (Fat Boy's, etc). I could see myself going for a looong 5-10 mile run in the morning and finding myself here and spending all of my money just eating and eating and eating at those stands. That sounds like a great way to spend the day. Why don't I do that? Eurrrgh, yeah -- why do you have to be so far away, Ithaca?! This needs to be replicated in every city. Get me the mayor on the phone! Can't we start an Internet petition and pass a law that requires every farmer's market in existence to just model what Ithaca has created? I want a little bit of Ithaca's hippie love to stay with me everywhere I go. Is that weird? I don't even care.
It's covered, but it's also open-air. The Ithaca Farmer's Market is an excellent stop for breakfast or to browse local produce and crafts. Located at Steamboat Landing every Saturday and Sunday, it's also open for summer months on Thursdays and also on Tuesdays at Dewitt Park. What To Buy: Everything you can get your hands on! No really, there are so many wonderful delicious items...and some unique items as well. Look around once, then go back a second time for the shopping.

This place is a mecca of food. Tons of local farms and producers with an endless variety of products. If you want lunch, there are tons of stands with fresh and yummy food for you. If you want art, they have that too. Fresh produce, it's everywhere (and mostly organic). Looking for some wine, yep that's there. Cheese fiend, you won't be disappointed. Fresh baked goods, you betcha with yummy bread galore. Most places have very reasonable prices and it's all extremely fresh! I always love speaking to the people who grow the food I eat. It allows you to have much more of a connection to your food. I love the enclosed Pavillion and how it's right on the water. It's a beautiful market and by far the best I have ever been to. If you are ever in the area this is a must visit! Better than any supermarket could ever dream of being.

This place epitomizes Ithaca. Vibrant community, wood, flowers, compostable dining ware, good food, lots of vegan options and a folky acoustic guitar crew. If you're in Ithaca, you have to go here. It'll make you feel happy.

OMG. It's my favorite part to visiting Ithaca.  It's the NICEST farmer's market I've ever been to.  It's not that extensive or large, but it's super diverse in things offered... everything in season, local, fresh.  I'm Cambodian and who would have guessed that they would have a vendor selling authentic Cambodian food there?  They also have Tibetan!   I ended up loading up on the best fresh OJ, some delicious peanut noodles from Macro Mama's, and shared my husband's amazing breakfast burrito from Solaz.  I wish I could have a farmer's market this nice in my hometown!

"Upscale, yet homey" is the best way to describe the IFM. My dad talked up the wood fired flat bread pizza and it was awesome! The asiago/garlic and farmer's special with spicy sausage were what we gobbled down. I literally stood out back behind the pizza oven and savored the wonderful smell emanating from the wood oven. We also sampled Cambodian food, amazing macaroons, ice cream, and cookies. If we had not been so fun, and the Labor Day weekend lines so long, we would have tried a couple other tasty items. Everything was delicious and served with a smile. Yeah, some items may be a tad overpriced, but nothing we had was not worth the extra money. Even with a large crowd, due to Labor Day weekend and Cornell/Ithaca college students back in town, the market is well organized and the lines move quickly.

They have great stuff here-- food, crafts, massages, music.  I've come here once before in 2010 after the dragonboat festival and enjoyed the vast amounts of food that was available.   The market is set up semi-outdoors (there is a roof, running water but the market is set up as stalls for each vendor.)  So each vendor has a stall to market their wares.  Their wares range from artwork (photographs, wood carvings, glass blowing, etc) to food (vegetables, fruits, wine, and prepared foods of all ethnic groups) to flowers.  There is usually music going on outdoors where a lot of the people park themselves on the rocks by the inlet and eat their purchases.   The prices are pretty reasonable for the items that are for sale.  Thai iced tea was $2.00, comparable to the ones I can get here in Baltimore-- and what was even better was that it was a tad less sweet than what i can get here.   The must stop is the Cambodian food stall-- chicken amok is yum.   Last year i got a fafalel wrap from the gyro stall which was also very tasty. The market is very eco-conscious-- all their wares are sold in compost-able  containers, and they have explicitly marked bins for recycling.

In Philly, we love our farmers' markets, so while visiting Ithaca, we made sure to stop by. The Ithaca Farmer's Market is an awesome blend of produce, ready-to-eat foods, and crafts. I got myself some tasty Sri Lankan food for lunch, a gluten-free brownie for dessert, and some dried mushrooms to take home for making soup. If I lived in Ithaca, I'm pretty sure I would be stuffing my face here every weekend!

Ithaca farmer's market is an all-around fabulous experience.  In one hour you can: Taste delicious wines and hard ciders Taste delicious, tasty prepared foods of all varieties Ogle beautiful local produce Ogle beautiful locals selling said produce Listen to live, local music Peruse and purchase local art and other goods Fell the breeze off the lake Be happy to be alive

Amazing farmers market. Just amazing. I'm used to farmers markets having mostly plants, produce, homemade salad dressing, and honey. The Ithaca Farmer's Market has everything! Amazing Bakery goods (4 vendors for that). Wine (2 vendors). Cheese. Prepared food. Homemade products. etc etc. I've been to farmers markets in LA (Santa Monica, Koreatown, Larchmont Village), and this puts them all to shame. Definitely check it out! Buy local!
As a native Ithacan I've watched the market evolve over time... and now it's really at it's best. When I'm home visiting its first on my list.... delicious food, great scenery, and a place to stroll with friends (and pets! on sundays!) Love it. Highlights from this past weekend: woodfired pizza fresh organic lemonade pottery breakfast burritos spicy radish sprouts (try anything once!)

I had the pleasure of spending a rainy Saturday morning in April wandering with a friend through the stalls of the farmer's market. Highlight:  Listening to some guy wearing a blue microfleece jester cap playing the guitar singing a song about squirrels titled "I Like Nuts." Besides the live music, there's plenty of other "local flavor" to find, and there's a crazy amount of variety.  Handmade goods, delicious soup, honey, fresh vegetables, even soap, scarves, and artwork!  And, if you're not buying fresh, local food to take home and make yourself, you can also get some food prepared right at the market, including some pretty tasty Cambodian fare (Cambodian food in Ithaca?  Who'd-a thunk it?) I bought a bison roast here that was phe-nom-en-al, had a delightful conversation with a potato grower, and managed to snatch the few last fresh carrots from a local farm. Tip:  On Saturday mornings, I'd avoid the parking lot - it's a bit of a zoo (on rainy Saturday mornings, it's just a mess).  Just park off to the side on one of the paved roads and hoof it in.

I didn't know a farmers' market could be this good. This is one of my favorite things to do in Ithaca.  I could easily go both weekend mornings.  There is a terrific selection of produce from local farms, and so much more.  Plants, baked goods, quilts, photographs, jewelry, cut flowers, yarn, pottery, and about fifty other types of things are sold there.   If you're just visiting Ithaca, definitely be sure to experience this lovely market.

As a student I didn't start coming here until the end of my junior year, which I really do regret not doing sooner.  The products are fresh and local, everything is from local farmers and vendors, and it's just a nice way to spend a day.  Sit with some food over at the dock and watch the boats and the ducks :) Great food options, the Cambodian food and Finger Lake Pizza!  Not together, separate occasions.   Also, love the soap stand.

I'm not trying to get nostalgic, but this is one of the things that I will really, truly miss about Ithaca when my husband graduates and we move away in a few weeks. The farmers market itself is beautiful--the pavilion is open and airy and looks out over the canal to Cass Park. Local musicians set up and serenade the patrons lounging on the dock and benches, eating their lunch and appreciating the warm Ithaca weather while it lasts. Definitely grab something to eat before you peruse the stalls (the breakfast burritos are drool-worthy deliciousness!), then shop for your fruits, veggies, honey, maple syrup, wine, baked goods, flowers, meat, cheese, local crafts, plants, etc. Be sure to shop around before purchasing anything, unless you are partial to a particular stall--prices, though reasonable, do vary from seller to seller. And be prepared to get a slightly-dirty look if you show up without your own reusable grocery bag. The Ithaca farmers market is a must-see for everyone who comes to town on the weekend. The beautiful, fresh food just tastes better here!

I adore this market and consider it one of my favorite things to do on a sunny Saturday.  It opened for the season today, and I bought Piggery porkchops (which I grilled for dinner - they were AWESOME), an adorable apron, a chocolate tart and an almond crossaint from Just Desserts, and a fantastic lunch from the Cambodian stand. It has more of a mini-festival vibe than a straight-up Farmer's Market, which is part of the draw.  There are artists &massage, music &jewelers, soap & honey.  I end up buying a LOT of gifts from the market - pottery, clothing, stationary, wine, flowers, etc.   And the prepared food options are endless - my favorites being the Cambodian food, the samosas, and the flatbread pizzas.  I also like the Solaz burritos, the Japanese noodles, and the sesame balls at one of the asian places.  Hmmm ok I also like the Cuban food, Gimme Coffee (who I hope returns there...), and the crepes!  Like I said, there are a lot of options. As for the farms - some of my favorite are Kingbird, Stick and Stone, and Early Morning.  The farmers are all friendly and helpful - and a lot of them have CSA's.  My garden is actually big enough to grow most of what I need each year - but the market is great for when I'm cooking for company, or when I need some random ingredient or some flowers,  I also buy a good number of plants for my garden from the market each spring. Parking is fine if you don't bother trying to park close - just park along the road before the train tracks and you'll save some time and frustration.  And if you eat the way I do while I'm there, you'll need to walk it off a little bit anyway.

Very hard to beat. Every time I go I usually spend double of what I intended spending. Great selection of local wines and ciders, great breakfast burritos, gyros, cheeses, Cambodian food, ice cream, fresh meats, etc etc. One of the best ways to spend a Saturday or Sunday in Ithaca.

Possibly one of the best ways to spend a saturday/sunday afternoon. This is one of my favorite breakfast/brunch places in ithaca. Loads of little stalls offering local produce . Lots of food options, crepes, cambodian food, bakery products. In nice weather, you can take a boat ride on Cayuga lake for half an hour Its a must visit place. You will love this place.

This was the first stop on our grand tour of Ithaca.  Traffic was a little crazy on a Sat. morning.  We got lucky with parking and found a spot just outside the pavilion.  It's a decent market, being a few hours away from home we really weren't in a position to stock up on fresh produce. It was smaller than we had expected and I'm not sure why there is such a huge traffic backup to get into this place. We did pick up some strawberries that were super tasty.  We also grabbed some lunch while we were there.  DW went with a Belgian Waffle and I went with some Chinese food.  My General Tso's chicken was meh.  DW enjoyed her waffle.  We completed our trip with a Strawberry \ Nutella crepe which DD thoroughly enjoyed.

I love it here!  One of the best Farmer's Markets I have ever been too.  This Fall visit was awesome.  Lots of great produce, meats, prepared foods and crafts vendors.  I can't say enough great things about the Market.  I would suggest this to anyone visiting or living in the area.  Everything I tasted was awesome here, I wish my stomach was bigger and I could have eaten even more prepared foods.  A really great foodie haven!

I've come here twice before and I love sampling all the food that is available. They have a lot of yummy ethnic foods, which I've always enjoyed. Parking is semi-easy to find (there is always a spot open, but it's still a pretty packed parking lot). The easiest way to get here is by car. They have a variety of different tables/booths and it's fun to just browse around. They offer a wide variety of things, including fresh-made juice, pottery, clothes, food, plant seeds, etc (seriously, the list goes on and on). I would definitely recommend you come here at least once. There is a lake you can go to and enjoy your food and there is a live band that plays out there. It's nice and scenic.

I was in Ithaca this past weekend visiting a friend that is going to grad school at Cornell.  He told us we have to try this Farmer's Market because it is amazing.  Was it? You bet your ass it was!  I'm quite familiar with the farmer's market scene.  I frequent them quite often in South Jersey.  The SJ variety are nice, but don't often go beyond tons of fresh locally sourced fruits and vegetables.  Some do have cheese and craft stands.  This market just blew my mind on how well versed it was.  Yes you have your produce, but they also have tons of hot ethnic food options prepared to order.  I was like a kid in a candy store.  I realized this might be one of the few chances to try anything here.  The girlfriend and I split some Cambodian food as we have never had it before.  It was a hot chicken/noodle/veggie dish that blew our minds.  It was spicy, but not overwhelming.  For $7 bucks it was an absolute steal.  Next we had to get some fresh squeezed lemonade from one of the stands.  It was excellent.  Next before heading out we wanted to get something else to split.  We ventured down to the greek stand to try their falafel pita wrap.  The falafel was fried crispy and was quite spicy.  The balance of the spice and coolness of the taziki/veggies were well done.   There are just simply so many options here, that it can simply be overwhelming.  The entire place is covered, so inclement weather shouldn't be a bother.  It is situated right near the docks so you can enjoy your food while people feed the ducks on the water.  If I am ever in the area, this is a must visit.

Truly one of the better farmers market my wife and I have been to . We stopped here (Steamboat Landing location) on our way back from a weekend trip to the Fingerlakes region. The market has everything from craft items, to fresh fruits & veggies, to local food stalls here. The market is located in an open air pavillion so it's great to visit in the summer even if the sun is beating down. There were tons of vendors offering countless items for sale. We bought some organic blueberries and corn for our trip back to NYC. We got lunch at a Cambodian stall. It's located in the center of the market by the water. DELICIOUS and very flavorful! A big plus is that the organization running the market is very 'green'. The trash bins encourages you to put things into the compost pile. They present you with examples of where things should go. We also notice that the food vendors also use compostable utensils which takes the guessing work out. Overall, a great place to go if you're a local or a tourist passing through. Be sure to visit their website to see if its open. There are multiple locations where the farmers market is held.

This might be my favorite place in the world. I grew up in Ithaca, and every time I come home to visit, this is the first place I want to go. Coming to the Ithaca Farmers' Market is completely an experience. The food is INCREDIBLE. There are SO many options...delicious pastries, baked goods, crepes, burritos, soups, Chinese food, Cambodian food, Thai food, Jamaican food, Cuban food, pizza, coffee, macrobiotic food, vegetarian food, vegan food, pies, muffins, breads, cheeses...it goes on and on! The fresh, local produce sold is unbeatable in quality and price. The fresh flowers are absolutely AMAZING, and you can't find flowers so beautiful in such large quantities for such a low price anywhere. The crafts and other goods sold (art work, photography, pottery, jewelry, blankets, clothing, etc.) are so unique and so beautiful. There is almost always some sort of band playing to really perfect the atmosphere, and sometimes 2! My favorite are the bluegrass and string bands. And of course, the view/surroundings of Cayuga Lake RIGHT there are breathtaking. The actual market is in a covered but open structure, so you are outside but when it rains you can keep dry! I think this farmer's market is the perfect size...there is a wide variety of stuff to eat, look at, listen to, and buy, and the crowd is usually pretty big but not so big that you can't move. It's not overwhelming, but it's also not so small that you run out of things to do in 10 minutes. When my family goes, we make a morning of it; we make the rounds and look at all the booths and buy whatever we plan to buy (always produce and flowers for the week at a minimum), then we get coffee and start the process of deciding which food to get! Once everyone's gotten their pick for the day, we head down to the dock or one of the benches by the lake and have a nice, relaxing breakfast/lunch together surrounded by the beautiful scenery with the awesome music in the background! If you know anything about Ithaca, you know that the people who constitute the crowd are totally apart of the atmosphere as well...every kind of person under the sun is there! Hippies, Cornell students, families, teenagers, you name it...it is a very open, accepting, sometimes eccentric, laid back and liberal crowd. Basically, come as you are! The only downside of the Ithaca Farmers' Market is their dog policy: no dogs in the covered pavilion area. That kind of sucks for us dog-owners, who would love to enjoy a beautiful morning at the market with our pups. This is a semi-recent development and while we are not fans of it, it has not deterred us from continuing to attend! You can bring dogs OUTSIDE of the pavilion...but that means someone has to stay with them while the rest of the group explores the market, which isn't ideal. Aside from that minor drawback, I LOVE LOVE LOVE the Ithaca Farmers' Market...pretty close to heaven on Earth.

This farmers market is out of a fairy tale. There is produce, prepared foods, local cheeses and all on a very picturesque setting. I wish I didn't live so far away, but I do try to make it when I am Ithaca on the weekend!

So after living in Ithaca for 5 years and now moving out to southern California my appreciation and love of the Ithaca farmers market had only grown! First off the location is fantastic at steamboat landing provides picturesque spring summer and fall settings and the built in booths in the pavilion make everything manageable for both vendors and customers. Second the quality and selection of the produce here is top notch. I was looking forward to the markets here in sunny SoCal but other than year round berries the farmers out here have nothing on the finger lakes. Finally the food vendors are delicious and there's so much variety in the ethnic cuisine from south Asian to south American to crepes and pizza. Oh and solaz has the best breakfast burrito ever I make sure to stop by whenever I'm visiting.

You can find anything here from cute local baby clothes, to hand made flutes, to delicious fresh-cooked foods (of all flavors), to local, homemade ice cream! You get to do this all on the shoreline of Cayuga Lake, sitting on the dock, a bench, or a beautiful tree.  So many options, you will end up being full and bringing home fresh, local produce for dinner.  What a win!

What is there not to love here? There are lots of vendors sells fresh and organic  fruits, vegetables, flowers, honey, jam, nuts, and prepared foods (I agree Angela N that there's always a huge line on Sundays for the breakfast burritos. And why not, it smells great!) Best of all, they're all from the Ithaca/finger lakes area! I love buying tasty food and drinks and eating it right along the lake. You can truly enjoy life's simple pleasure here! Don't forget to buy yourself a Cornell wooden clock tower here for souvenir if you haven't bought one already.

This is quote possibly the coolest Farmer's Market I (or you) have been to.  Growing up in the 70's, Mom dragged us to co-ops and markets that felt just like this one. A bunch of happy vendors selling fruits, veggies, and handmade items - goodies like bread, honey, as well as a smattering of arts and crafts. A very laid back feel, even when the sheltering barn is packed with shoppers. If you are looking for a true blue Farmer's Market, this is the place to be. It will make you happy!
The farmer's market had a nice vibe and friendly people, but I expected more...farm produce.  It was a little too put-together and a little too permanent to feel like a true farmer's market.  That said, it made for an enjoyable morning stroll, complete with breakfast relleno and local purchases.

I bought a breakfast burrito because of all the great reviews I had read. However, I was disappointed as the burrito seemed to be relatively bland.

Maple sugar cotton candy. Home made hard ciders. Blueberry wine. Grass fed meats. It reminded me of Seattle's Pike Place Market -- less dense, less commercial -- but equally charming and equally reflective of the region.

friggin BEST farmer's market ever.  anything you could ever want can be found here.  i ADOOOOOOORE the farmer's market for its high density of super tasty food stalls.  and extra extra extra points for using only biodegradable/compostable plateware/utensils!!! i absolutely love being able to buy some bread/cambodian/whatever and take it to a table or bench by the water, and spend a bit of leisurely weekend time eating and losing myself to the moment.  i wish all farmer's markets could be this amazing.

A must stop for any visitors to the Ithaca area, and come hungry!  Visit the soup guy for whatever he's got that day, as well as his fabulous home made ice cream.  Grab a gimme! coffee.  Curry in a Hurry, Macro Mamas, the Gyro guy, flatbreads, burritos... you name it, we've got it.  And it's such a beautiful location that really shows Ithaca at its best (as well as its most "Ithacaish").  You can even come by boat or take a boat trip while you're here.   Best of all for us locals, the farms and wineries and eateries we depend on for the freshest local goodies.

I loved the Ithaca Farmers' Market and I wished it was open longer and closer to Cornell so I could visit it more often when I was there. It's in a really nice location on Lake Cayuga and they have delicious ice cream, maple candy, lemonade, etc.

OMG. So much awesome farm-fresh food, great prepared foods, ethnic food, crafts, soup, wine, art, music, and so much more. It is a joy to come here. This place is a MUST for a foodie! Can't wait until it opens again!!

Wow, I have never been to a farmers market before but wow this is amazing. Everything is fresh, tons of people and locals trying to sell their homemade natural products. Cider hot/cold, fresh apples, candles, pottery, flowers, etc are all sold here by very friendly people. A great view of the lake is right at the end of the market. Reasonable prices on the fresh produce, as for pottery and things like that I would say they are on the more expensive end but I am not an expert on the fair market value for those things. Most people I would say come here to enjoy the experience of the market, chat with other people, hang out around the dock that overlooks the lake and enjoy the scenery, and above all to buy fresh produce.

You have to come here when in Ithaca, a definite must, a not to miss, a dont miss it type of place.  IFM literally has everything and to top it off they even have wine, oh yes boys and girls, wine.... Got here early in the AM and went to the Tex/Mex stall for some bfast and the special bfast burrito of the day was Ahhmazinggggg. Got some baked goods at a stall near the lemonade and orange juice table, yes fresh OJ! Cuban Food stall, was okay nothing to try keep walking, Asian stall with no sign saying whether the food is Chinese or what is okay, had some crab rangoon which was tasty but the same as every chinese restaurant serves. I read on Yelp about a Cambodian Food stall and thought I found it, on main corridor, but this was not the booth, the Cambodian stall is off the main corridor and on the side corridor almost at the end almost across from the Cuban stall and by the time I found it I was full :(

This is probably the most beautiful farmers market you have ever been to.  If you come out in the spring, especially, expect a day of warm sun, delicious international food and gorgeous surroundings.  And definitely get the Cambodian food- it's amazing!

I really don't the hype about this farmers' market. It's nothing great! I think it's because there's nothing better to do in Ithaca so people make it into a big deal. There's maybe 30 stands and you can also order food and eat it outside in some dirty picnic-y area. Parking is almost impossible unless you go later in the day. I say ditch the market and just shop at Wegmans!

The Ithaca's farmer's market is by far the best farmer's market I've seen. It's well organized filled with cool stuff ranging from tasty cambodain food to organic meats. The Ithaca's farmer's market is  great place to spend a weekend morning just gawking and buying goodies. But some of the stuff can be a little overpriced(IMHO).

I love this place. I don't live in Ithaca, but my X used to go to school at Cornell and we'd drive on down to the farmers market every weekend when I was visiting. It is simply amazing, everything from great wine, to great producer to great samosas! If you get a chance to try the apple cider donuts, GIVE IT A GO, they are worth it!

Having grown up in Marin County where they have one of THE best farmer's markets in the world, I am not easy to impress. That said, I thought the Ithaca market had a nice vibe, decent food, and reasonably priced local wine. My kids really enjoyed it and I think it's definitely worth a visit. If I lived in Ithaca I would go often.

What a fantastic venue full of great local food, crafts and wine.  Parking can be a challenge because the place is so popular!

Great food, produce, and always live music. A great place to see people you know. If you're visiting, you have to include this spot in your plans.

Love the food, location & people... feels like home. My wife and I were married at the IFM last summer. An amazing location on the lake with everything we were looking for in our wedding venue. **Warning**: Having a wedding at the IFM is not for the faint-of-heart. It requires a lot of legwork and a bit of magic to pull it off. There's really nothing there, except for a pavilion and a couple power outlets, so you better embrace your inner event planner... or contract an event planner who's done weddings there before because there are quite a few "gotchas" in planning an event here.

Let me preface my rating by saying I took one star away for the city/market failing to react to the traffic situation at 13 and 3rd St due to this.  The farmer's market has gotten so big that it disrupts traffic, and sometimes seems counterproductive to have people idling in their cars and SUVs for 15-20 minutes, so they can simply purchase some produce.  I HIGHLY reccomend parking offsite closer to the Science Center and walking over.  However, when they resolve this situation, I will gladly amend and remove this caveat.  With that being said: I have been frequenting the Ithaca Market for years now, and it is hands down a life saver in Ithaca.  Set against the water's edge of Cayuga Lake inlets, and amongst the trees, is a T shaped pavilion which houses the market.  While early or late in the season, the market can be dominated by craft vendors due to farmers only having cellar veggies and some hearty veggies to sell, this quickly is resolved as the season progresses and more options are available.  As far as I know, all produce and meat vendors sell Organic and sustainably farmed foods ONLY.  If you're looking to discover how little you know about the produce world, take a visit.  We delight every year over purple carrots and asparagus, snow white cherry tomatoes, red and white striped beets, and countless other unique items.  You can find grass fed beef, pork, chicken, lamb, ox tail, bison, duck, about any meat you desire there.  Also, since it is directly from the farm to you, expect your produce to last extra long, and be comparable in price to conventionally farmed products in stores, since the middleman is gone.  Countless varieties of flowers and apples also grace the market.  I am sorry to say I have yet to see persimmons or other unique native fruit.          The market also has food vendors.  Yes, we Americans love to eat eat eat.  The market is peppered throughout with multi cultural food vendors, from asian, to vegan, to Cuban, to crepes and flatbread.  While part of me wishes these food vendors would be transplanted to an offsite location and open 7 days a week, I must admit it is nice to grab a bite while shopping, especially if the market is in the middle of our weekend errands run.  Expect to find something for everyone to love if you go to eat.         That would lead me to the last, but certainly not least important section of my review.  COMPOSTABLES.  Most food vendors at the market have switched to corn based compostable forks and spoons, plates, etc for serving.  The market is moving to be a waste free zone, and I applaud them for that.  When arriving, take 10 seconds, read a sign at ANY ENTRANCE OR DISPOSAL CAN, and correctly compost, recycle, or dispose of your items.  Enjoy the market!

We pick up fresh vegetables & meat directly from local farms.  Diversity of foods available is amazing.  Definitely the place to food shop in Ithaca.

Actually the most amazing place on earth. Don't miss out on the breakfast burrito stand, its the best.

Indulged in apple cider, blackberry wine, strawberry water, mac n cheese, Cambodian cuisine, macrobiotic dishes, and a bison burger in one trip! Great Market....just wished it was larger since I've been to The Grove (Los Angeles), Reading Terminal Market (Philly), and Pike Place (Seattle). Eve's "Essence" Cider is hands down the best Cider I've ever tried. The best.

Great, great weekend activity is spending a couple of hours at the Steamboat Landing location of the Ithaca Farmer's Market.  Just be aware this market is only Saturday and Sundays.  Was there for the first time this past Sunday and it compares very favorably to other city market's I have been to:  a mix of produce, baked goods, gifts, and restaurant kiosks.  Don't get too crazy eating the food at one vendor because there are plenty of foods to be sampled.

Fantastic place to be on a saturday. Fresh produce from great farmers.

Wow, this is a seriously awesome farmers' market. There is so much to choose from! I was somewhat surprised that the actual vegetables and fruits were a bit outnumbered by a host of boothes offering delicious foods from all around the world. There was a place selling delicious, freshly made crepes and French baked goods, a place selling Cuban food, a place selling Mexican food, a booth with Thai food. Amazing! Such a delicious variety. There were also two vendors selling ice cream. There are great benches to sit along overlooking the lake. You could definitely come many times before you have the chance to sample everything. I would love to go back. I bought some delicious honey from one of the local bee keepers and am still savoring the great crepe I tried. My only complaint is that they need more garbage/ composting bins around the market. I had to walk half the market just to find a place to dispose of my trash.

I can't wait til our next trip to ithaca to grab some lemongrass chicken!  I really enjoyed the selection of crafts, clothing, groceries, wine, and prepared food at the market.
The Farmer's Market is truly one of the great things about Ithaca.  If you miss it, well, you won't be disappointed cause you won't know what you're missing, but suffice to say, it's pretty awesome.  Like many others have said, the breakfast burrito and the cambodian food is fantastic.  The Farmer's Market is virtually the only place in town that you can get a variety of delicious ethnic foods.  I also recently had the wood fired pizza, but at $7.50 for what looked like pretty much two big slices of pizza, I thought it was a bit on the pricey side.  There are also some great cheese shops and the Little Orchards stall at the end of the market has apple cider slushies in the summer and hot apple cider in the fall.  Yum.  The parking situation is a bit ridiculous, so it probably makes more sense to walk if you can.  Also there is not a ton of produce, which I find to be a little weird since it is a farmer's market.  That being said, there are some cool, crafty, gifty places.  The people who sell the food are generally pretty friendly and always on hand to answer whatever questions you have.  It's a great place to bring visitors for some tasty food and great people watching.  My point?  Don't miss it.

I can't help myself I love Ithaca.  The IFM was not around when I went to college here.  I wish I were 20 years younger and get to do this again.  Love getting some food and sitting on the inlet.  It's not the most beautiful inlet but I love it.

This is probably the single best part of visiting Ithaca. I'm a Cornell alumnus, but I'm always more excited to visit the Ithaca Farmers' Market than I am to visit Campus.
One of the best farmer market/eat out places I have visited. Been there in late summer, everything is just perfect. Very good selection of high quality produce & tasty food, and I love their fresh orange juice and summer cooler. Grab some street food and head for the dock, awesome view with live music around!

Cue Portlandia sketch skewering progressives who get overly excited about natural, locally sourced and homemade items (me! me! me!). I love the Ithaca Famer's Market-my favorite farmer's market of all the farmer's market in all the world (probably not the case but I want to keep the momentum going here).  I bought a cherry wood cutting board for only $25 directly from the craftsman who made it, same with my beeswax candles.  Be sure to look around before purchasing anything as some items that are similar are inflated depending on who sells it (another vendor sold cutting boards at 3x the price and he didn't carve them himself).  Pretty plants are sold here as is homemade food-Cuban, Asian, you name it.  The market itself is housed in a rustic pavilion and really lends itself to the experience of purchasing items that are close to the earth. A trip to Ithaca is not complete unless you go to the Ithaca Farmer's market.

Five Stars. Need I say more? Simply delicious! I love all the food and endless samples of wine and cider! Nothing beats a good day like being able to go to the Farmer's Market and eat your delicious food on the dock of Cayuga Lake :)

I'm from the suburbs of Baltimore, Maryland and we didn't have anything like this.  The food is great and the selection of fresh, local produce is good (but expensive).  I make my way down just about every weekend for a burrito or Cambodian.  The setting is very nice too and I could see where people would like to bring their kids down.  It's water accessible, so if you're lucky enough to have a boat or canoe/kayak.  I've been told that farmer's markets are usually inexpensive.  This one is not... expect to pay $7 or more for your lunch.  Very much worth it in my opinion, however.

I have been to farmers markets all over the country and unfortunately this one is overrated. They do not have as much fresh produce as you would expect to see at a market. The prices on the bread and home made products are outrageous.

Ithaca Farmer's Market is great! It's a long-running local establishment and one of Ithaca's biggest draws on weekends, especially in the height of summer and around fall harvest time. They have basically everything you can imagine, from the freshest produce to local meats, cheeses, wines and freshly made baked goods. The food stalls span just about all cuisines. Standouts include great Cuban sandwiches and some of the best Pad Thai I've ever had. The wood-oven flatbreads are great too; the Southwestern with corn relish and chipotle sauce is amazing. The baked goods are by far the best part. If you are willing to look around you can do a surprising amount of your shopping here. The Farmer's Market is also a great place to go for gifts, as there are a number of stalls featuring the work of local artists, photographers, and jewelers. Overall this is a great place to go to spend a Saturday morning and a required stop for anyone visiting Ithaca.
