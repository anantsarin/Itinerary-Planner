Great spot for all ages... 2 courses... Main attraction is the waterfall in the center with fire flaming out of it. Great picture opportunities! Recommend to anyone!!!! Right in the heart of all the fun!
First off, find the $1 off coupon in the Niagara Falls entertainment coupon booklet. I really enjoyed playing mini golf at Dinosaur Adventure Golf since it's not the typical cheesy kind. There are two courses you can choose from: T-Rex or Raptor. The attendant said T-Rex was more difficult so we decided to play that course. There are 18 holes in total with a variety of terrains which keeps the game more interesting. The decor, sound, and props were nicely laid out and goes with their dinosaur theme. We went around 1 pm and didn't really have to wait for the people ahead of us to complete a round. I would definitely recommend Dinosaur Adventure Golf if you are in the area!
