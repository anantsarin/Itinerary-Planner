You just need to know about the Pink Stripe Cookies, which any born and bred Jamestown resident has been eating since birth. All of their baked goods that I have ever had are tasty and fresh. I've had birthday cake over the years and other holiday treats, but I had to stop for the Pink Stripe Cookies today. They have a nice little diner/deli area that you can get a meal or fresh cut deli meats now. Service was fast and friendly. A dozen cookies was about $4.50, but for not having these in many years, they hit the spot.

Another amazing donut discovery on our Midwest/Western NY roadtrip. Well, I suppose I can't say this was a discovery since my husband tipped me off to these, but they were a first time for me. This is an old school bakery and diner in Jamestown. They serve all kinds of baked goods - not just donuts. We got there at about 11am and they were almost sold out of everything, which is a little crazy. F-in' early birds. I got some vanilla crunch, maple glazed, cinnamon cake, and chocolate frosted cake donuts. I really only can eat one donut in a sitting, and we were on our way to the airport, so I had to make a choice of which donut I was going to eat. MAPLE GLAZE, MOTHERFUCKERS. It was really good. It has a cake donut base. The maple glaze was delectable, and the inside of the donut had moderate lightness. Really tasty stuff. It made me wish I had a bigger stomach so I could have tried the vanilla crunch. We will be back here once we return to Chautauqua Lake, for sure.

They make a mean donut. Also, the pepperoni rolls are pretty good. Everything there, really, is.

I will never, ever, EVER say a bad word about Ecklof's. Aside from them being an institution, they are the one place I look forward to the most when coming back to visit. Their donuts are what I go for, but they have so much more to offer. If I have to pick my poison, I'm all in for a chocolate-covered, cream-filled donut. I have been eating donuts here for over 20 years and THESE ARE THE SAME EVERY TIME. Consistency is a virtue when so many places have changed their recipes to cut their costs. LOVE. Now I just have to figure out how to transport them all back home safely..

While most of the reviews here on Yelp for Ecklof are for the bakery, my review is for the deli. Yes, they serve lunch, I believe, from 11 AM to 3 PM. The selections aren't much, but for what they have, they do well. I had the half roast beef panini, as well as a bowl of the cream of chicken soup. The panini was well done, it wasn't greasy at all, and looked freshly made. I found it amusing that they say how many panini makers they have on the menu, asking for extra time for large orders. I wanted soup, they only had cream of chicken, but that was great. I wasn't able to try any of their baked goods, which, according to the reviews here, are amazing. The only thing I tried was a sugar cookie with a pink glaze, which, while it wasn't bad, it wasn't great either. After all, it was just a sugar cookie. So, I am giving this place 4 stars. It's a great local joint, offering cheap food, but for the price, it's well worth it. Thankfully, Yelp was there to suggest this place, allowing us to avoid the chain establishments that usually would just result in our meal being blah.

I'm surprised there is only one review. Their baked goods are phenomenal.  I actually went there today (after going to AJ's) as I am home visiting my parents and bought three dozen cookies.  My must-haves are pink stripe, curbstones, and oatmeal peanut butter.  My mom always got our birthday cakes here when I was growing up and they are tasty. I've been here for lunch once and had a panini that was good.  I like that they have expanded their business and have created a bigger market for their food. Now if only I could figure out how to make the pink stripe cookie...
