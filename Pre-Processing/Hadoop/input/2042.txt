Quality executed at its finest! My boyfriend and I decided to grab I bite to eat before heading out for some shopping. Located quietly in the corner of the Colvin Eggert plaza, Exit 2 is warmly inviting. The nice set up of the restaurant has the bar sectioned off from the dining area. We decided to sit in the dining area, with the waitress sitting us next to the small fireplace. She quickly handed us the menus. Oh the options! What to choose? The chicken and waffles description has my taste buds watering. Being my second time there (first time my father and boyfriend got the fish fry and I got the berries salad- which all were outstanding!), I wanted to explore something new on the menu. Coffee burger? Gemmolini? I couldn't decide. My boyfriend decided on the "build your own burger" & I finally went with my watering taste buds and got the chicken and waffles, but not before we settled in an order of chicken fingers for an appetizer. The fingers came out- lightly battered, with sides of carrots, celery & blue cheese. Best. Chicken. Fingers. Ever. Not the flattened-overly battered- out of the freezer- fingers that every other place slaps on your plate. Not even close. These were plump juicy fingers that had a breaking that was to write home about. Now I was ready for my entree! I saw the waitress bringing the food over- mainly because I was watching her bring out everyone's dishes because I was curious to see what everyone was picking tonight. My mountain of chicken laid on top of a warm Belgian waffle with light drizzles if maple syrup that seemed so perfectly displayed- it looked like a picture out of Bon Appetite. This dish, had the perfect combination of flavors dancing in your mouth! The portion was absolutely ginormous, leaving me enough to snack on tonight!  Exit 2 has climbed the ranks in our regular outings! If you are looking for a great meal that you won't break the bank with- this is the spot!

After the game My Friend and Myself decided to go Exit 2.  My Friend had enjoyed His first visit and was anxious to find out that His first visit wasn't a fluke.  He wasn't disappointed and It was My great fortune to tag along.     We were greeted and seated in short order.  We ordered two outstanding beers and pursued the menu.  I had The Great Lakes Erie Monster and My Friend had the IPA from Southern Tier Brewing. The fact that they pour Great Lakes Beer is a plus.     I have to be honest I was uncomfortable with the menu.  The entrées did not come with salads or soups.  I also thought the sides were pricey.  I decided that I would hunker down and let the chips fall where they may.  My friend went with the Shrimp Scampi. He was thoroughly happy with His dish.  I went for the Ravioli.  On the menu it is called Oli'o.  It features fresh tomatoes, sautéed spinach and a oil, white wine sauce.  I enjoyed it so much because the flavors came together and were delicate.  That is what I look for in Italian Dishes, delicate flavor.  I enjoyed the dish so much that I initial misgivings faded away.    The Lovely Young Lady who owns the place came by and inquired whether or not We enjoyed our meals, a nice touch.       I would not hesitate to dine here again.

The food was absolutely amazing. The atmosphere was nice and quaint, but also not pretentious at the same time. Whatever you get....get on a pretzel roll, or a order of pretzels to start. I can't wait to go back.

First of I'm a super picky individual, I work down the street from this restaurant and I have to say I'm pretty impressed. I placed a to-go order, the food was delicious and the service was fast and friendly! From now on that'll be lunch and most likely my dinner spot! They rock!!!!

Very disappointed, place looked good, welcoming and comfortable. Service was good but felt a little rushed. Weren't finished with apps and just dropped entrees.  The prices don't match what you get, not even close.  Biggest compliant is the mussels, tasted good but several were shattered so there were shells you kept getting in your mouth, quite gross.  Several didn't open, felt ripped off.  We told the waitress she wasn't interested.  I had the eggplant  parm, I can't figure out how you could cook it and have it turn out so bad, my guess is that it was either cooked several days ago or had been frozen.  Could get better at a diner for half the price.  Too many good places to visit in Buffalo, won't be returning.
There is nothing bad to say about this place.  It's one of our favorite places to eat. Everything we've ordered in our numerous visits has been nothing short of wonderful and the staff and atmosphere are fantastic.  Highly recommended.

this place has great food ! esp for a newly opened restaurant !  the fish fry is great - not the best piece of fish ur ever going to have - but very good -- and the sides !!! omg - the are the BEST -- baked beans and brussel sprouts!!   wings are the best in WNY if you like them hot and crispy.  hot not suicide.  the hot is not just more med sauce - not wet w sauce (that makes them not crisp anymore) -  had them 3Xs - they are perfect !  bacon wrapped jumbo shrimp app - yum !  bar is fun too -- the chef here obviously gets it and the mgr came over to the table to ask how everything is on each visit !  A+ !!
Had been wanting to try this place and on a Friday night with a packed parking lot, we took this to be a good sign and stopped in.  Turns out the bar (a separate section) is the monthly meeting spot for a National Guard group.  The restaurant side had a few empty tables yet so there was no wait.  We were promptly greeted and seated.  Our waitress was very personable and helpful.   Excited to be waiting on "newbies" she told us about a couple of their popular appetizers and explained that everything is homemade.  I had the beer battered haddock fish fry (light, crispy batter) which comes with choice of 2 homemade sides, and not just limited to potato salad, mac salad and cole slaw like all the other places.  Here, you could have house salad, baked beans, veggies, pasta salad...  even so, I had the traditional potato salad and coleslaw, because that's what I like and both were very good.  Husband had the macaroni salad (also very good, I snagged a bite) with his burger.   Very nice relaxed atmosphere.  Owner (manager?) stopped by the table - always a nice touch.  I'll definitely be going back soon for another fish dinner.
