Finally found this place during a necessary trip to UB north campus. I usually don't come to campus for food, but I had other business to take care of. I had read all the positives about this place and finally found it in an outdoor courtyard of restaurants near the student union. The atmosphere is pretty neat. Perfect spot to take a date or just for opening up the books. They have a wide variety of different bubble teas (my fav is the taro). They have this neat machine whose sole purpose is to shake/mix the tea - it kept me fairly entertained while I was waiting for my drink! They also serve food but we'll have to try next time. If you're craving some bubble tea near UB north, you gotta stop in. The only tricky part is finding a spot to park...

Best bubble tea in Buffalo! This brand is really popular in Flushing, NY and after a long bit of searching finally found it up here in New York. They have like the best bubble tea and they really don't skimp out on the jelly or bubbles for the teA. If you get both, it will literally  take up half the cup XD. I would recommend trying out all of their flavor as the majority of them are good. They also have these side dishes are pretty good. Their popcorn chicken is prob my favorite. Their pork buns, tea eggs, and braised pork are also good. Thinking about  it now, most of their dishes are pretty good and cheap. Food aside they have a really nice setting inside the store with plenty of seats and some booths for privacy and larger groups. They also have a private room for karoke but you have to pay for that. Definitely a place to visit if you are around the area. Beware though it gets busy at times since it caters heavily to UB students

I'm often looking for a relaxing place to lounge back and do some work and when Kung Fu Tea showed up during my "nearby" prompt on the Yelp App for Coffee / Tea, I decided to make the drive down to UB's North Campus and check it out. Inside, I felt like I was in a mix between a nightclub lounge and a coffee shop and I gotta say it worked. A nice, sleek atmosphere with high top tables and booths for larger groups. I went up to the register to try some of their food and decided on their pork belly buns -- which were very affordable and turned out delicious. Pieces of pork belly, mayo on a nice little bun -- two coming to my order. I didn't get any of the bubble tea, but enjoyed sitting back on at a table and doing some work for a few hours. Lots of college kids were hanging out and talking. For some nice light snacks + bubble tea + studying; this place is great!

Tea is good but food still have space to improve. （The popcorn chicken is nasty）. The cashier has attitude and is very impolite.

Omgosh this is so awesome. The highlight of Buffalo is Walmart (what is that??) and then came Kung Fu Tea. Whoever thought about franchising a Kung Fu Tea up here is a genius! Its not even your typical small cramped bubble tea shop but the decor is awesome. It's really pretty. Also I freakin LOVE avacado and avacado fries the concept of it is already making me drool. Buffalo is super lucky, the other thing is a lot of college kids are from New York City and they're usually home sick but KFT must help. I love it!

I have been to my share of kung fu teas ln the east coast and this is by far the best one  so far. The decor, the spacious seating, the small eats food menu makes it one of a kind. I would like to recommend the pork belly buns! It just melts in your mouth. Lets not forget about the fries and the special sauce that comes with it. I want to know the darn ingredient. Wont be able to find this sauce anywhere else. So much delciousness in one place!

I literally drove 6.5 hours through a blizzard just to see what the KFT in Buffalo/Amherst was about (JK, I go to school here). I was blown away! This is the nicest KFT thats ever opened due to the decor and layout of the place. What really is crazy is the unique food they have here!!!! Avocado fries, Pork Belly buns, Macaroons, cake?! Who the F doesnt like cake!  This is truly one of its kind and they taken bubble tea to a new level. -Just tell them Eric sent you.

The students on UB's campus talk this place up a lot for what it's actually worth. The atmosphere is incredibly upscale (4 star restaurant worthy) in comparison to the rest of the schools restaurants, however the value that you receive is far less than what is to be expected from the decor. The menu is quite a bit perplexing unless you're a regular at this restaurant, so I suggest going with someone who's been before. You might want to consider prepping yourself for this endeavor because the cashiers also had attitudes to be expected from high schoolers. Also, make sure you bring quite a large sum of cash, since the place is quite pricy- I spent ~$20 on two large bubble teas. The service was relatively quick, however the quality was less than I would have liked. The taro bubble tea was lacking flavor; I suspect they cut corners by skipping out on the powder that's put in the milk. The fries, however, we're very nice. Small, but nice. They have a seasoning on them that is sweet and salty, with assorted Asian seasonings that I cannot quite identify. They were doused in this mixture though and I would have preferred a little less of it. My suggestion is to visit Kung Food off south campus. It has much higher quality for almost half the cost.

KFT's milk teas are reminiscent of those at Tapioca Express back home, which is both good and bad. Both places have perfectly cooked tapioca most of the time, but the milk teas tend to be over-sweet and milky, overpowering the tea base. I would recommend adjusting the sugar level, but in my experience, ordering 25% less sugar (not even half!) has made the drink taste bitter. This being the case, I prefer the fruit teas as they are usually well-proportioned between sweetness+tea and have not yet disappointed. Slightly overpriced, but decent- satisfying when you're craving boba.

SO HAPPY that KFT is finally in Buffalo for all of us to enjoy!! :) Thank you!!!!

I was super excited to learn that they had opened store in Buffalo.  Upon walking it, it reminded me of the tea houses back in Cali. Plenty of booths and tablesfor groups of friends to sit down.  Decor was very modern with lots of TVs showing various channels. Kung Fu Tea is a chain, so their drinks are pretty standard. My only recommendation would be to ask for 1/2 sugar because they tend to be very sweet.

The atmosphere/decor of this place is amazing. Its not only awesome for a cafe on Campus grounds but also cool enough to look like a cafe in NYC! The bubbles in the bubble teas are good too. I haven't tried a great variety but their Classic Kung Fu Tea and their Green Tea bubble tea are pretty good. I think the price is a bit too high compared to how much you get, but I still find myself going back there every so often. Also, their Avocado Fries are delicious. I'm curious to see how the other food items will taste! Def editing this review once I go to try other things on the menu!

Not what I expected. I felt the quantity of food was less. The prices look cheaper than elsewhere on UB campus but you'll end up paying a lot more if you want to eat a decent amount of food so you don't end up having a food break two hours later. Also, I specifically asked for a lactose free bubble tea, maybe one with yogurt, but I was given a milk based one and had to endure two days of agony. So, if you're lactose intolerant, please make sure it is a lactose free one before taking a sip. The bubble tea was alright. Not as good as it's hyped up to be. The ambience is very nice though. Not what you would expect to find at commons at all.

The bubble tea here is really good, probably best in Buffalo. The bubbles are really good, a bit sweet and the texture is just right. Some of the drinks are a bit weird though, like the honey tomato twister, not really a fan of that one. I've tried a number of the snacks. Pork rice is good. The popcorn chicken is a bit salty but good to share. I like tea eggs, theirs were really good the first time I got it but second time, I don't think they were quite ready yet. I like curry skewers too - fish balls and fish tofu. I tried the vietnamese egg rolls too, pretty good. They have nice booths that sort of enclose so you can have a lot of privacy.

We were very surprised to find this hidden gem. We missed a movie tonight, and went for food in place of the movie. The food is pretty cheap we were able to get 2 bubble teas, pancakes, dumplings and pork rice, all for under $20. The decor was very clean and ultra modern. Felt a little old, not realizing when we are headed there at this is on a college campus. I am truly glad that we stopped , we will absolutely stop by again at some point.

Words cannot describe this New KFT. Taking your first step in, you feel the strong culture that they are trying to bring in on campus (Especially for those who come from the city). The decor is phenomenal and the place is comfortable and spacious (unlike the other spots in the commons where you have to climb on top of 20 other people with bubble jackets to get your order). Just like their famous signature drinks, the food here is one-of-a-kind and absolutely delicious (You must try the braised pork and fries). I hope they bring more franchises like this one up. Awesome job KFT of Buffalo!!
The prices are outrageous. This is not NYC!! When someone at this location tells me "corporate sets the prices" at all locations, that has to be the dumbest business decision ever. I was shocked at how expensive a darn bubble tea costs! I can get bubble tea cheaper and you're not providing much bang for the buck. And fries on a styrofoam plate? No, you didn't, did you?

I love their bubble tea but it tends to be a bit too sweet so I usually get 1/2 sugar with less ice. I enjoy their taro, oolong, matcha, green bubble teas. I've their fries (which weren't very good.. I'm going to assume it was because I went at 7pm) and their pork belly buns which I enjoyed. I'm gonna give the fries another chance, not quite sure how you even mess up fries but I'll be back. I go to school here anyways.. I can't avoid it even if I wanted to.

Best Kung fu bubble tea ever!! A lot of settings and excellent decor. Excellent customer services and staffs are friendly.

This is the best place you can craft your bubble fantasy as well as night-market style of finger food/snacks in university at buffalo! The decoration is super modern and clean and the tea/food/service is amazing! Definitely try their freshly brew and cook Kung fu bubble tea! The red wow milk strike is so rich that you can have it with either cold or hot all day long! They also have plenty of fruit tea that use fresh juice to blend it! If you like your tea light, you can have your sugar level customize too!  Cashier is always smile and very helpful to recommend drink to suit for your flavor preference!

They have this new promotion on their new drink Mango Green Tea. It comes with the jelly. For all you thirsty people out there, get this drink and your thirst will be quenched. And for you meat lovers, they got the new Popcorn Chicken and Braised Pork over Rice. Comes with an egg and cabbage.

I'm so happy they finally put a Kung Fu Tea in Buffalo, NY and even better now because it's on UB campus. The Taro Milk Tea with bubbles and jelly is the best and tasted just like what I got in NYC. The service was good and was greeted when I entered the store. The decors are amazing and the design is over the top.

Very nice interior but not so nice staff. The barista with the bow tie shirt seems like she's always in a bad mood. Drinks are good but over priced.

Finally found a place with macaroons in Buffalo!! I recommend the rose and vanilla :).  A bit expensive, but I guess that's to be expected.  I'm more familiar with Tea Leaf (right down the road) and I prefer its menu layout because I was confused ordering and it turns out the pineapple tea wasn't bubble tea.. but the set up of Kung Fu Tea is pretty impressive. I would go there again, just hope they start taking campus cash soon!

Best boba tea place in Buffalo! Price is slightly expensive, but the quality is top notch. I live at south campus so it is a bit far, but the distance won't stop me from visiting again soon!

Its about time they had a bubble tea place. The staff is friendly and the service is excellent. I like the variety of appetizers and the drinks remind me of the place back home. Definitely will come again.

Ordered food waitied for 20mins. On Monday spring break .. there's like 10ppl in the place.
Says hours are until 11 but often close at around 9/10... you've been warned. For some reason, more expensive than the locations in NYC. Extremely crowded and doesn't seem well-managed, especially if employees are closing earlier than they're supposed to
