Great selection of beer and a great atmosphere to bring friends and relax. Small selection of food which could be expanded but all around one of the best places to go in the area.
Excellent beers, wines, and now food too! This place can tend to get over-packed on busy nights, but it's always a good time and a great atmosphere.
This place, Southern Tier Brewing Company, is my new favorite place. I wish it wasn't 4 hours away from me. I wish it was right next door. I want to live near here now. But I digress. First I have to mention that I have been a fan of Southern Tier's beer for many years. Who doesn't love Pumking, I know, but their IPAs and other offerings are all world class. I have always wanted to come to their brewpub The Empty Pint and finally was able to. The atmosphere is top notch, dark and moody with lots of beautiful deep woods. We went outside for a bit, although it was cold and rainy. The exterior looked really wonderful with lots of landscaping and more wood construction. Everyone here was friendly and we loved the views of the brewing hardware through the windows. So we ordered some food which was a pastrami and swiss sandwich and a scotch egg (!). You order at a little station and then they bring it out in short order. It arrived and we were both very impressed. The sandwich was tender and moist and had great flavor. I was surprised to even see a scotch egg on the menu and it tasted really good. I tried just about every beer that I wanted to, including some pub exclusives. They were, of course, amazing. In short, we stayed here for several hours soaking it all in and trying all of the fresh beer. I had zero complaints and many compliments for Southern Tier the whole time. We left with some beers to go as well as a shirt and some stickers. Good times.
First of all my 2 stars is only directed towards the brewery physical plant & tour and not the beer because we all know that the beer is awesome. We started our Saturday road trip to visit the  brewery from downtown Buffalo a 1:45 hr trip. We arrived at Southern Tier at 11:40am the doors open at 12:00pm. We wanted to do the brewery tour and tasting. By the time we got to the register the only remaining tours were after 3:00pm. Very disappointing considering the fact that you can not reserve or buy the tours in advance. It's strictly first come first serve. We were not the only ones that were extremely disappointed and some others had driven over 4hrs to get there. I think the mangers need to re evaluate the tour group size or develop a system to allow future purchase for people making the effort to drive in from way out of town especially on the weekends or holidays. Other than the above disappointment, the property was nice and we enjoyed eating the  picnic lunch we had packed and drinking some great beer right from the source. Also they do not accept American Express cards....bummer!
I'm not a fan of craft beers. My favorite beers are the kind that taste like seltzer. But I still had a great time at the Southern Tier Brewing Company this weekend! The catfish sandwich is delicious, and the outdoor patio area was really cool. There is no table wait service, but I thought the system of ordering food at the register to be pretty convenient and well-organized. All the employees were friendly. My friends were excited to stock up on their favorite IPAs.
Incredible beer as always. However, today was our first visit to the brewery pub and we left disappointed. The line to order food was about 30 minutes long. Trying to grab a table was next to impossible. The line for beer stretched across the room. Clearly this gorgeous space with amazing beer and a mouth-watering menu was not designed to handle the crowd that showed up on Sunday of Labor Day, and the rain lessened the available tables to nil. We were able to enjoy the four varieties of beer we got on our first visit to the bar, but the lines got the best of us and we left without a second round or bite to eat. The food (slowly) coming out of the kitchen looked awesome though!
Let me start off by telling you all that I'm a big fan of Southern Tier's beers. Pumking is by far my favorite fall beer and many of their other beers do not fall far behind. That said, I may be a little biased.. but in reality, good beer is good beer. And you can find their beer all over the country. When I went to Alaska a couple years ago, I enjoyed a delicious Southern Tier Choklat so I could have a little piece of home. The brewery itself is really beautiful. It's out in the middle of nowhere just outside of Jamestown and on a huge lot of property. Tours start at the Empty Pint, which is their bar/restaurant area. If I lived closer, I would totally go there for a few beers and some food. It's very welcoming and clean! The tour was shorter and not as interesting as I expected. Our tour guide was nice and knowledgeable (though he did have some pretty rough jokes) and we learned a lot from him, but it was pretty much just him talking and us watching. Nothing was moving around so we didn't get to see anything in action and we didn't get to sample any beers DURING the tour (I saw someone else recently said they did.. hmph). BUT once the tour was over, we got four pretty large samples to drink in the tasting room, so I guess I can't complain. That was definitely the best part! The tasting room is a beautiful bar area with lots of seating and a fake fireplace. Quite cozy and the beer was good! Next time, I'll probably skip the tour and stay at the Empty Pint. ;)
Southern Tier is not only my favorite Western New York brewery, but perhaps my favorite brewery in the country.  Located a short distance from Jamestown, Southern Tier boasts a very impressive and beautiful facility. The tap room is spacious and inviting. It features a full bar with plenty of seating. Stop by in the summer to enjoy the outdoor patio and some live music.  They also have a limited food menu with pulled pork sandwiches. There is a very small gift shop where you can buy glasses, key chains, shirts, hats, etc. The tour is worth the price. You'll tour the facility, receive a souvenir glass, and enjoy samples. Our guide was very knowledgeable and clearly enjoyed his job. The tour itself does not cover much ground of the facility. For most of the time you'll remain in the same area. Mostly you'll learn about the brewery's history, their different beers, taste samples, talk with other beer lovers, and have a great time.  Tours book up fast so arrive at least 1 hr before start time.   The beer: These are craft beers made for craft beer lovers. Be warned, you will not find many light beers here - blondes, pilsners, lagers, etc. Many of their brews are heavier (with over 7% ABV) and require the right palate.  Also, their seasonals and limiteds can be a bit pricey. My favorites include: Choklat:  Perhaps my favorite chocolate beer.  Phenomenal American double stout. Very rich and silky smooth.   PumpKing Ale:  A very nice interpretation of a pumpkin beer.  Plenty of pumpkin spice but not overwhelming. Delicious! Creme Brulee: This is their imperial milk stout. Tastes like a dessert but with nearly 10% ABV.  You'll definitely need a sweet tooth to enjoy this one. Great a cold winter night. Oaked Aged Unearthly: Very nice imperial IPA aged in oak. Also about 10% ABV. Citrusy but with bite. Southern Tier does a great job with this one. If you're anywhere near Jamestown you need to make this a stop. It's absolutely amazing that a brewery of this caliper exists in this area. Truly world class.  Don't forget to bring home a growler! Quick note - There is a strict policy of not allowing kids on a tour due to hazard concerns.
Not only does Southern Tier put out some of the best craft beers, but their facility is picturesque and fun.  I haven't been on many brewery tours, but of the few I've done, this is one of my favorites.  The tour guides are a lot of fun and very informative.  You get a lot of beer samples throughout the tour (included in the price of the tour) and you may be a little tipsy before you even start drinking at the bar! The bar itself is also great.  I went in the winter so I didn't get to experience their beautiful outdoor space.  In the summer there are often bands playing in the gazebo. For beer snobs, it really does not get much better than Southern Tier.  A wide array of many different beers, all delicious.  This tour is a MUST for anyone who appreciates beer.
I have never met a southern tier beer I did not like. 5 of us stopped for a brewery tour last summer when we were visiting lake Chataqua and it was the highlight of our trip! The brewery tour is first come first served and is worth heading over there early to obtain a spot. Everyone gets a glass at the beginning of the tour and everyone is taken around the small brewery tasting everything. Thank goodness we had picked a designated driver because by the end of it we were all a bit toasted. The pulled pork sandwiches we had were delicious! Cases and bottles are a great price. Loved the glasses we took home to. Had a wonderful time! Worth a stop!
I have been a fan of Southern Tier for a while now, and it was about time I made my way to the brewery.  I drove up with some friends this afternoon on a great day in Lakewood, NY.  The brewery is sort of in the middle of nowhere.  That is, it would be the middle of nowhere if Southern Tier wasn't there!  It's very impressive that a place like this can distribute so far from here.  I have seen their beer in North Carolina, Florida, etc.  Sadly, there were no tours available today.  I will surely be back on a Saturday for the tour. Their beers are awesome.  Pumking is one my all-time favorites, but seeing as it's nearly June, no Pumking for me today.  I ordered a flight of 4 for $10, because obviously I wasn't going all the way to the brewery and only having one. Mokah - First off, wow.  This brewery just knocks it out of the park with stouts.  Creme Brulee, 2XStout, etc.  Really incredible across the board.  Now back to Mokah:  Monster aroma of chocolate, coffee, roasty scents as well.   Coffee is stronger flavor when it comes to the taste.  Extremely drinkable despite the 11.2% ABV... Go slow with this one.  I was in the minority amongst my friends, but I prefer this to Creme Brulee. Compass - I wasn't too impressed with this one.  The rose hips definitely have a distinct taste to them.  Tropical fruit smell to go along with the floral from the rose hips.  Nothing crazy about this one but again, as many Southern Tier beers do, it hides the high ABV very well. Farmer's Tan - Floral, citrusy hop aroma.  Tropical hop taste that's very light, obviously.  It is a session IPA, after all.  A solid session beer that is perfect for summer. Gemini - Awesome hop aroma with some pine.  It definitely doesn't hide the alcohol quite like the others.  Very solid DIPA, and my second favorite beer of the day. Great atmosphere with a nice patio outside.  I really want to come back and do the tour!  Southern Tier is quite a bit out of the way, but it is absolutely worth it.
A fantastic tap room reminiscent of Highland's Brewing in North Carolina.  Wide open spaces, with a number of their beers on tap in various sizes for a good price. Also available are a wide range of merchandise and tours. a very pretty place to enjoy beer, either inside or outside. Live music on some days. Play some stones while you drink. Didn't get to go on the tour, the place was packed for 4pm on a Saturday.
Great selection of beer and a great atmosphere to bring friends and relax. Small selection of food which could be expanded but all around one of the best places to go in the area.
I've been to a number of big breweries and microbreweries but none better than Southern Tier Brewery. It's located off the main road in what appears to be an industrial park, but Southern Tier, though industrial itself, has nicely managed to avoid any of that horrid industrial look about it. Indeed the design, the lawn landscaping, the stone work and the natural wood work is not only exudes quality of workmanship, but lends a warm comfortable feeling about the place. You enter through what appears as a side door and suddenly you are into a big room with all kinds of choices of beer and ale selections. Better yet, the staff is friendly and more than willing to give you a taste before you make your drink decision. To the back and outside is a really nice patio and set apart from that a beautiful wooden stage area where various musical entertainment is offered. The back lawn and landscaping offers a great little place to roam, chat with fellow patrons or if you have kids, a great place to let them run around. There is also a small water stream and on top of the knoll a game area where they play "stone ball" which is something I confess to not having a clue about. As for beers, in one word, terrific! They have some of the best I've ever tasted in the United States, a country unfortunately known for beers of dish water flavor. My favorite was their Phin & Matts, an American Pale Ale made up with ale yeast, three varieties of hops and three varieties of malts, but choose whatever suits you. When I counted I noted a selection of twenty-five though I'm not sure all were offered fresh on tap.
Excellent beers, wines, and now food too! This place can tend to get over-packed on busy nights, but it's always a good time and a great atmosphere.
After a year of drinking Southern Tier's unique beers, I have come to the conclusion that they brew the most amazing beer in the world. Really. Seriously. I swear. I have never been so passionate about a beer in my life. Come to think of it, I don't think I've ever been so passionate about a *person*. I am very lucky that there are several bars in Brooklyn that serve these ambrosial, flavorful beers. I don't think they have a single product that I've never LOVED. My favorites, lately: Unearthly Imperial IPA - an intensely hoppy (5!! hops) beer, at 11% abv. This beer is extremely rich, and I can't imagine having more than one, but the one I drink is savored and WORSHIPPED for its quality. Imperial Choklat Stout - 11% abv - OMG. I'm not usually a huge fan of Chocolate stouts, but this was DIFFERENT. It was like drinking a chocolate milkshake. My boyfriend and I were obsessed with this for a good month, frequenting Harefield Road to get our fix. It's unbelievable, and VERY strong. I get a good buzz from a single glass. Hop Sun - 4.5% abv -I'm not so big on wheat beers, as I often find them to be too light and flavorless, but this is a summer wheat beer that I can really get into. It manages to be interesting AND refreshing, something that I don't think is easily achieved. This is no blue moon, people. This is HEAVEN. If you've never tried Southern Tier I suggest you get your arse over to Harefield Road or the Diamond and get your drink on. It will CHANGE YOUR LIFE. FUN FACT: THEY MAKE A CREME BRULEE BEER, WHICH I HAVENT BEEN ABLE TO GET MY HANDS ON. THESE PEOPLE ARE INSANELY AMAZING.

Brewery:  Southern Tier's brewery has a rather nice piece of land.  Getting to it may be a bit of a drive, but having grown up in the area it is easy to find even being out in the middle of nowhere (relatively speaking).   The tasting room is quite large and has a good amount of seats.  Large windows on one side allow you to peek in to where the "magic" happens.  The bar has about 10 taps (even a few nitro) to allow you to enjoy a pint or build your own flight.   The past few times I stopped in there were limited food options, but was told they were working on expanding the working kitchen. Tours:  Unless recently changed, you can not reserve or purchase a tour ahead of time.  They work on a first come basis.  This can be problematic if you are traveling any distance (about 1:45 drive from Buffalo)  Once in a tour, however, they do hook you up.  You get a glass to keep, and they fill it multiple times during the tour process.  Southern Tier beers are usually quite heavy on the ABV so no need to drink beforehand. Beers:  Southern Tier has several excellent beers.  A quick search on ratebeer or other like websites will prove how highly thought of a good number of these beverages are.  Chocolat is possibly my favorite chocolate stout.  2X Stout is a very solid milk stout.  Their IPA can easily be found on tap locally, and is always a trusty go to (better than their 2X IPA)   They offer several oak-aged choices (seasonally) including their Backburner and Pumking (although that may have been a one time offering)   Speaking of Pumking... people love it.  There are a ton of pumpkin beers out there these days but this one is right up at the top for me.  If you like it, try the Warlock... not nearly as sweet and packs a punch.   A lot of the beers Southern Tier creates are Imperials or Doubles (2X).  These are all between 7% & 10% alcohol and quite often only offered in 22oz bottles.  A craft beer lover's delight, but not for the casual Bud drinker. I am happy to say that this brewery is thriving right near where I was born and am always glad to see it pop up nationwide.  I have seen STBC selections as far away as Virginia, Florida and California.  We are lucky to be able to get some whenever we choose, as there is a huge demand for certain selections nationally, with little luck scoring a drop.

Yum!!! Love it This place is amazing... just imagine fresh from the kegs Creme Brulee Stout at noon on a Saturday morning... what a great way to start the tour and start the weekend. The people who work here are really laid-back, but the tasting room and brewery are clean, crisp, bright, and new. You get to taste a bunch of the batches straight out of the process and leave with a cute pint glass. Southern Tier is a bit "out of the way" off the beaten path, but if you get a chance to drive through Western NY, do not miss it.

Staying in Chautauqua.New York for a winter holiday, we found that there is almost nothing to do in Jamestown or the surrounding area (besides ski). Then I noticed the woman giving samples at the grocery store actually worked for Southern Tier...  You mean Southern Tier is right next door!! Ohhh, the vacation is saved! We spent two nights in a row hanging out at the beautiful bar inside the brewery. They don't have a tasting tray, but the very patient bartender will pour samples of anything. The prices for growers are very reasonable too. We would have gone back every night, but the bar is only open on weekends. The tour was worth the price, if only to see the facility, get the souvenir glass, and more samples. Our guide was not as knowledgeable as say, one of the brewmasters, but we were free to walk about, and ended up talking to a brewmaster anyway. The beer: A big heads up. These are craft beers made for craft beer drinkers. If you don't like big hoppy IPAs, beers that don't always taste like beer, then you won't like most of Southern Tier's selection. As one of our friends noted, he could taste the beer in his mouth loooooong after he swallowed it. I was personally in heaven. Our favorites include: "Chocolate Ale." Best chocolate beer ever. Hard to finish a glass, it's that rich. "PumpKing Ale." The only pumpkin beer in the world that's not overly sweet, but super full bodied. A can of pumpkin spices in the face, without being too much, somehow. "Old Man Winter." They say this is a winter ale, but it's not a white ale, and its' not a christmas beer. I think the closest thing I've had to it is the Great Lakes Dortmunder. It's easy to drink a lot of this stuff, and we did.

We travel to many breweries and are huge craft beer fans.  Southern tier has to be one of my favorites.  They have an upstairs tasting room where you can order a flight of four beers for $10.  You can't order beer by the glass or have a growler filled at this part of the facility unless you are part of a brewery tour group.  Downstairs, they have an indoor/ outdoor searing area and a stage where bands sometimes play.  The decor and ambiance here is top notch. It is a beautiful, and really fun place to drink beer.  The food menu is limited to snack type items and sandwiches.  Even so, everything we have tried from the menu has been very tasty.  But really, you come here for the beer- not the food.  The beer is done right.  Pumking is the absolute best pumpkin beer I have tried yet. Another fall seasonal, Harvest is just as good but lesser known.  The tier du garde and Live are also beers I really enjoy.  We make the trek up to southern tier a few times a year as they really know how to brew beer.  Already looking forward to the next trip!!
A fantastic tap room reminiscent of Highland's Brewing in North Carolina.  Wide open spaces, with a number of their beers on tap in various sizes for a good price.

Southern Tier is beer nirvana. I've been to a bunch of beer festivals including GABF, and have likely tried in the area of 1,000 beers.  That being said, Southern Tier's Choklat & Pumking are two of my favorite beers on the planet, and you can get them here BY THE GROWLER.  Anddddd....16oz pours of 8-12% beers are like $5; you can't get big pours like that just about anywhere else.  The space is really nice; it invokes the feeling of a ski lodge.  Some breweries have a very "industrial" feel, but not here, here feels like home.   They're only open on Thurs-Friday 4-10pm, Saturday 12-10pm, and Sunday 12-6.  They don't have much in the way of food here, but they do have what looked like an amazing pulled pork sandwich, and it's really cheap.  If this place was near me, I'd probably live here on the weekends For the true Yelpers, this is a $$ max; for some reason it's marked as $$$ right now.

What an awesome time!  After a few months of pining for more Creme Brulee and Pumpking, we could not resist the short drive from Erie to Lakewood NY on a weekend home from Pittsburgh PA.   We had assumed it would be busy for the tour so we did get there early and thank God we did!  They opened at 2pm and the first tour was at 3pm... it sold out almost immediately (and now STBC has added an earlier tour to the schedule which is awesome so more people can enjoy this greatness).  The tour groups are a reasonable size... you learn a lot about the beers, the process, and get to sample A LOT of their beer... best $8 ever spent... The Empty Pint has pulled pork sandwiches that look yummy (we did not try them), and so many STBC beers to enjoy! If you like Craft Brews... check out Southern Tier... you won't be disappointed!

Not only does Southern Tier make my favorite local beer, they've got a kick ass brewery. I have been on a ton of brewery tours. Probably too many. No. That's not possible. Anyway, I've been on my fair share... The point is: Southern Tier has the best brewery tour (and facility) I've ever been to. The guide was knowledgeable and didn't pull any gimmicky shit. The group of people touring were also the most knowledgeable out of any tour I've  been on. My theory is this, Southern Tier must realize if you come all the way out here, you must be serious. So, they treat you as such. Thanks, friends. I digress. The tour. We check out the bottling area, conditioning area, etc and drink four beers. Tons of time for Q&A. Sippin. Chatting. And, did I mention, it's FREE. You can also just go to their beautiful facility to drink their glorious beer. They also make tasty pulled pork sammies so you don't get stranded out there. I want to move in.

I am happy to say that this brewery is thriving right near where I was born and am always glad to see it pop up nationwide.  I have seen STBC selections as far away as Virginia, Florida and California.  We are lucky to be able to get some whenever we choose, as there is a huge demand for certain selections nationally, with little luck scoring a drop.
Looking for a little adventure my friend and I drove out here from Cleveland, OH for St. Patrick's Day.  It's a beautiful drive. We loved their beers and figured 'why not?' Southern Brewery is located in an industrial park area in Lakewood, New York. A really small town by Chatauqua Lake. One wrong turn and we almost missed it. The Brewery is large but we were expecting a little more from the tasting room, The Empty Pint. Perhaps were are too accustomed to our hometown Great Lakes Brewery. The Empty Pint is a open tasting room behind the brewery. They had at least 8 delicious and strong beers on tap. We fell in love with the Choklat stout, a deep thick stout that boasted chocolate flavor. Next we sampled the Iniquity imperial black ale and the Back Burner barley wine style ale.  Both were excellent. I swear the Back Burner tasted like iced tea - dangerously smooth. The food choices were limited to a corned beef sandwich (special for St. Pat's) soup, and chips. My friend said the sandwich was hearty and good. As a vegetarian,  I stuck to soup and potato chips. They were good but I was hoping for a little more to eat especially since the brews had higher ABV. For the Irish holiday, a bagpipe player performed. The place was filling up quickly with folks celebrating. We met locals and other folks from out of town. We heard the local cops are pretty serious when it comes to DUI's, so take a DD, or a cab. We stayed in a cheap motel down the road. Eventually we left looking for somewhere else to eat, but on our way out we grabbed some six packs of the Chautauqua brew and some souvenir pint glasses for the folks back in Clevo. This was  a great adventure and we enjoyed seeing where some of our favorite brews were made. Cheers!
Yum!!! Love it This place is amazing... just imagine fresh from the kegs Creme Brulee Stout at noon on a Saturday morning... what a great way to start the tour and start the weekend. The people who work here are really laid-back, but the tasting room and brewery are clean, crisp, bright, and new. You get to taste a bunch of the batches straight out of the process and leave with a cute pint glass. Southern Tier is a bit "out of the way" off the beaten path, but if you get a chance to drive through Western NY, do not miss it.
If you like a rustic setting to drink delicious beer-  get your booty here asap. I myself prefer going here in finer weather when people can sit outside and there's room for everyone. Just the other day I stopped by and had to turn around and leave cause it was packed beyond belief. It pretty much always is. These guys know what they're doing in the world of craft beers. I'm an IPA freak but am willing to try other flavors. I do have to say- the Creme Brulee was a sticky sweet mess. And I found the Pumpking way to much like a piece of pumpkin pie smashed in a glass. Not my fave but maybe yours? I've had the pulled pork and it's okay. The sauce wasn't anything to ask extra for. I wish they would get other food because when there's beer flowing- folks are going to get dahrunk....but I get it- they're all about beer! The kicker though is you can bring your own food. There is nothing finer then getting a pizza a few pints and sitting on the outdoor patio. There is a tour, there is a "gift shop" with t-shirt type things and beer. There is not a lot of parking, and the good news is they're apparently expanding.
Staying in Chautauqua.New York for a winter holiday, we found that there is almost nothing to do in Jamestown or the surrounding area (besides ski). Then I noticed the woman giving samples at the grocery store actually worked for Southern Tier...  You mean Southern Tier is right next door!! Ohhh, the vacation is saved! We spent two nights in a row hanging out at the beautiful bar inside the brewery. They don't have a tasting tray, but the very patient bartender will pour samples of anything. The prices for growers are very reasonable too. We would have gone back every night, but the bar is only open on weekends. The tour was worth the price, if only to see the facility, get the souvenir glass, and more samples. Our guide was not as knowledgeable as say, one of the brewmasters, but we were free to walk about, and ended up talking to a brewmaster anyway. The beer: A big heads up. These are craft beers made for craft beer drinkers. If you don't like big hoppy IPAs, beers that don't always taste like beer, then you won't like most of Southern Tier's selection. As one of our friends noted, he could taste the beer in his mouth loooooong after he swallowed it. I was personally in heaven. Our favorites include: "Chocolate Ale." Best chocolate beer ever. Hard to finish a glass, it's that rich. "PumpKing Ale." The only pumpkin beer in the world that's not overly sweet, but super full bodied. A can of pumpkin spices in the face, without being too much, somehow. "Old Man Winter." They say this is a winter ale, but it's not a white ale, and its' not a christmas beer. I think the closest thing I've had to it is the Great Lakes Dortmunder. It's easy to drink a lot of this stuff, and we did.
I seldom review a brewery that I haven't personally visited, but a few days ago I encountered Southern Tier's Crème Brulee Imperial Milk Stout at the Village Tap in Chicago, and would like to give it a shout-out.  This is at the far end of the stylistic spectrum, so much so as to be utterly un-beerlike; but, taken on its own merits, an engaging and utterly remarkable outlier.  The overall hedonic impression combines milk chocolate (anybody remember Bosco?) and vanilla baby custard; at 9.5% ABV, it's perhaps best described as a beer-based cream liqueur.  Village Tap even offers it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, as a float.  Definitely not to everybody's taste, but for those with a sweet tooth in beer (or drinks in general), worth seeking out.
We travel to many breweries and are huge craft beer fans.  Southern tier has to be one of my favorites.  They have an upstairs tasting room where you can order a flight of four beers for $10.  You can't order beer by the glass or have a growler filled at this part of the facility unless you are part of a brewery tour group.  Downstairs, they have an indoor/ outdoor searing area and a stage where bands sometimes play.  The decor and ambiance here is top notch. It is a beautiful, and really fun place to drink beer.  The food menu is limited to snack type items and sandwiches.  Even so, everything we have tried from the menu has been very tasty.  But really, you come here for the beer- not the food.  The beer is done right.  Pumking is the absolute best pumpkin beer I have tried yet. Another fall seasonal, Harvest is just as good but lesser known.  The tier du garde and Live are also beers I really enjoy.  We make the trek up to southern tier a few times a year as they really know how to brew beer.  Already looking forward to the next trip!!
One of the few brewery's I've been to. Not only is this place beautiful but the beer is delicious! When I went the place was packed. They have an indoor and an outdoor bar, a nice spacious area outside, and they had a band playing. From what I heard they had just renovated. If you get a chance to try the Pumpking it's a must drink! Try to buy a growler or case there if you can, it's much cheaper than when I buy in Ohio.
Southern Tier is beer nirvana. I've been to a bunch of beer festivals including GABF, and have likely tried in the area of 1,000 beers.  That being said, Southern Tier's Choklat & Pumking are two of my favorite beers on the planet, and you can get them here BY THE GROWLER.  Anddddd....16oz pours of 8-12% beers are like $5; you can't get big pours like that just about anywhere else.  The space is really nice; it invokes the feeling of a ski lodge.  Some breweries have a very "industrial" feel, but not here, here feels like home.   They're only open on Thurs-Friday 4-10pm, Saturday 12-10pm, and Sunday 12-6.  They don't have much in the way of food here, but they do have what looked like an amazing pulled pork sandwich, and it's really cheap.  If this place was near me, I'd probably live here on the weekends For the true Yelpers, this is a $$ max; for some reason it's marked as $$$ right now.
Wow - this brewery is amazing! Great atmosphere, best beer in the world! My two favorites are PUMKING and 2XIPA. DELISH! Growlers were a little pricey, I think it was $24. One bar tender was a bit jerk-ish... he had black framed glasses and was kinda short. Almost acted like he was too good to poor your drink for you, and that you were stupid for asking questions. If you can avoid him, everything else is fantastic!  Wish they offered the brewery tours more often then just on Saturday. Really wanted to go, but couldn't make it. Also, wish they stayed open past 10 pm! I really, really wanted to give this place 5 stars, but the jerk bartender ruined that...
What an awesome time!  After a few months of pining for more Creme Brulee and Pumpking, we could not resist the short drive from Erie to Lakewood NY on a weekend home from Pittsburgh PA.   We had assumed it would be busy for the tour so we did get there early and thank God we did!  They opened at 2pm and the first tour was at 3pm... it sold out almost immediately (and now STBC has added an earlier tour to the schedule which is awesome so more people can enjoy this greatness).  The tour groups are a reasonable size... you learn a lot about the beers, the process, and get to sample A LOT of their beer... best $8 ever spent... The Empty Pint has pulled pork sandwiches that look yummy (we did not try them), and so many STBC beers to enjoy! If you like Craft Brews... check out Southern Tier... you won't be disappointed!
Being a huge fan of Southern Tier, I was excited to come visit the brewery. This place is fantastic! It has comfortable indoor an outdoor seating and it's nicely landscaped with a great stage out back. It's the perfect place to spend a summer afternoon. And the beer... Oh my god! It's even better than I expected it to be! Come to Southern Tier and have a beer (or two). You will certainly enjoy it!
Not only does Southern Tier make my favorite local beer, they've got a kick ass brewery. I have been on a ton of brewery tours. Probably too many. No. That's not possible. Anyway, I've been on my fair share... The point is: Southern Tier has the best brewery tour (and facility) I've ever been to. The guide was knowledgeable and didn't pull any gimmicky shit. The group of people touring were also the most knowledgeable out of any tour I've  been on. My theory is this, Southern Tier must realize if you come all the way out here, you must be serious. So, they treat you as such. Thanks, friends. I digress. The tour. We check out the bottling area, conditioning area, etc and drink four beers. Tons of time for Q&A. Sippin. Chatting. And, did I mention, it's FREE. You can also just go to their beautiful facility to drink their glorious beer. They also make tasty pulled pork sammies so you don't get stranded out there. I want to move in.
I stopped by here this past weekend with my girlfriend and her parents.  We decided to trek over here while up in Erie for the weekend for one of their Saturday tours.  The website said that the brewpub opened up at noon and we got there about 5 minutes after that and the place was packed!  I think that within a few minutes of us sitting down that every table inside of the place was full.  It was good that we went early to get our spots on the tour (limited to 20 and only at 1, 3 and 5 on the weekends) as we saw people being told the 1 PM tour was sold out at about 12:30.  The brewpub itself is a pretty cool space with a high vaulted ceiling with exposed wood, a glass window on one side with a view into the brewery and a bar serving most of their beers.  There is also an awesome  outside patio with its own bar and a stage for bands to play on.  Sadly, the day we were up there it was not terribly warm and so the outside bar was not open and we did not sit outside. I decided to get something to eat and drink before the tour since we had some time to kill.  The brewpub does not offer much as far as food and your choice is pretty much a BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich or the soup of the day.  Whenever we there the soup of the day happened to be white cheddar poblano.  Since I was hungry,  I decided on the pulled pork sandwich with a creme brulee stout while other members of my party decided to have soup.  My pulled pork sandwich came on a sesame seed bun with a side of potato chips.  My sandwich was marginal as I thought that the meat of the sandwich was good as it was still moist and that the BBQ sauce was ok.  Where it lost me was the bun which was huge and needed something, perhaps toasted or warmed with some butter?  Since I do not eat chips, the others at my table ate them all and enjoyed them while also debating whether they were homemade or not.  I was also able to taste the soup which was creamy and good.  My creme brulee stout was also as tasty as expected as this was the beer that put Southern Tier on the map for me with creme brulee being my favorite dessert. The brewery tour was thoroughly enjoyable.  Whenever you purchase the tour they give you a glass which is to be used for the sampling during the tour.  In the tour, most of which is spent standing in a spot where you can see many of the vats, the mash machine and bottling process, the guide describes much of what is going on at the brewery.  While he is speaking you are also treated to rather sizable samples of 4 different beers which while we there consisted of the Creme Brulee Stout, 2XIPA, Pumking and a new one called Live.  If you liked the sample, more was able to be had when the tour leader tried to get rid of the rest of a pitcher after serving all in attendance.  All of the beer was excellent.  The guide was engaging enough to keep our attention for the whole time and was also funny at times.  By the end of the tour I was very happy that we had made the trek over to the brewery. The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.  Their food and food selection leaves something to be desired but this place is rightfully all about their beer.  The tour was awesome and I enjoyed all of the beers that I had tried.

A nice way to relax and enjoy a few good craft brews (or wine).  We've stopped by a few times while riding motorcycles in the area with friends.Southern Tier has a good variety of beers to choose from.  Try their sampler tray to get a taste of some of the favorites.  Samples available at the bar.  Outdoor pavilion for live music.  Growlers too!

Fantastic brewery and a great atmosphere! I highly recommend their 2x IPA, Phin and Matt's, and their 422.

whenever i'm in the CHQ area (which isn't as often as I would like) I love making a stop by this brewery! they have such good beers. in the winter time, I really like the Old Man and the 2XMas. they always have a big selection of their brews at a good price. it will get pretty crowded though, so if you want a table to sit at, go early.
