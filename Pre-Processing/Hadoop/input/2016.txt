Was drawn to JP Dwyers because we were in town visiting some family and I read some Yelp reviews about the burgers and wings. My brother-in-law also commented on the cheeseburger. The building itself is quite charming and located on the main strip in North Tonawanda, an area that has undergone some impressive gentrification in recent years. We sat outside by the massive firepit, which is definitely one of the major assets here. I would totally be there in the backyard, huddled by the fire, enjoying a Guinness if I lived around here! The Guinness itself was average, more bitter than smooth. The wings were good - we got the hot BBQ kind - but they lacked the outer crispy texture that makes good wings great wings. The sauce was a little sweet for me, but I can't fault them for this. Most people love sweet BBQ. As for the cheeseburger we got, I was a little disappointed by it. The style of it I was not a fan of -- the meat patty was very thin, although packed with a flame-grilled flavor. It was a huge flattened patty on a large bun and looked impressive, but I really like thick and small burgers better because they are juicier. The fries, on the other hand, were plentiful and thin and crispy (if over-salted/seasoned) and I enjoyed them. A pleasant trip to a local favorite. I'll probably be back the next time I'm in town to give it another go.
Moved to area from Cali, apparently didn't know what good wings were!  Can't get enough. Great service, great food, and good beer, what more could I ask for.
This has always been one of my favorite Webster St. bars. Dwyer's has been home to all the local crowds looking for a fun Irish pub. Dwyer's has also been cranking out some of the best chicken wings in the area. They have over 10 flavors to choose from. The beer list is fantastic, especially considering the area. The list must be at least 20 choices long. The interior set-up is nice as well. I often enjoy a place where the bar and dining area are separate enough so that you could enjoy either individually or together - say for football games or something where the whole place is goin' crazy! Dwyer's also has 2 dart boards however they seem to be inconveniently located in the dining area, (Jakes does not). None-the-less this bar is still a great choice for Traditional Irish ambiance and good bar food. They Reuben-ize everything you can imagine - from sandwiches to fries, to potato skins and more. Yum! A few years ago the patio war began as I refer to it - Crazy Jakes vs. Dwyer's - who came out on top? I would honestly say both. These bars are completely different in what they offer but both patios are outstanding (both have huge fire pits). The best in the area. Dwyer's has been around longer so I tend to favor them however, if you're looking for a more contemporary bar go to Crazy Jakes. Whatever it is that you're looking for either one of these bars is sure to provide. Both are great stops for live outdoor music as well - this area of Tonawanda/North Tonawanda itself is known for great outdoor venues.
Being a UB student who spends most of their time in Amherst/North Buffalo area, this bar's location in NT feels like you've kind of left your vicinity and gone off to a nearby, less centralized and crowded area with an almost village feel (even though its only slightly less than 15 minutes via the expressway, though you do actually enter into niagara county). Really great "townie" bar overall though with the perfect crowd- never overwhelmingly crowded but far from dead. They have AMAZING wings and other dishes, as well as fairly cheap drinks and a very friendly and laid back staff. My favorite part about the bar is on Sabres Game nights they have a special of 20 wings and a pitcher of beer for $15.99, one of the most satisfying deals I've probably ever experienced in my lifetime. A MUST checkout for people who love their beer and wings (anyone from Buffalo).
I don't live too far from JP Dwyer's, and damn I'm glad. This place is awesome. It has a great selection of beers and even lets you sample, when deciding on trying something new. (just ask). Not only is there a great selection of beer, but the prices are excellent too. This goes for the food as well. The food still continues to impress me every time I am there. I must say that my favorites are the burgers and chicken wings. Trust me, for a pub, you couldn't beat this place with a stick. As for the service, make sure that you ask for Jessica. She is an excellent server and definitely a true professional. I can't wait to get back there again!!!!!
Wings were very good but very expensive and they charge for certain sauces. Blah. The burger bun was very large so they made the burger so flat so it wasn't my preferred thickness. It was a good burger though. I was told to get a stinger sandwich next time.
By far, the best all around bar in WNY. The best food and drinks. Great service and entertainment. Band or DJ, doesn't matter its a fun environment. I am glad i do not live near by because i would be there every night. Best and most chicken wing flavors i have seen anywhere. Great place to let loose.
Just had lunch here. Not much going on here midday but the food is terrific. Chef was nice to us Jersey folk and surprised us with a portion or raspberry BBQ wings....delicious! Their regular mild wings also good, had a bit of kick. Their burgers beat out any that I've had. They are big, juicy, and cooked just right and their celtic chips are great accompaniment. Try it, won't be disappointed.
Rock solid wings and cheap beer. For what it is, its near perfect.
Best wings I've had in a while! You also have to try the Mac and cheese bites and pretzel sticks. The bartender, Nick, was very friendly!
We have been to Dwyer's on two occasions. It's a great place to watch the Sabre's game and enjoy some great bar food. The bar offers a good mix of draft beers and features local brews. They offer deals on drinks for all Sabre's games and prices are very reasonable.  Their Celtic chips are made in house and definitely worth trying.  We have also tried the jalapeno poppers stuffed with cream cheese served with a raspberry dipping sauce. They were delicious! Far better than the traditional cheddar poppers. Their 12 oz burgers are huge and come in some interesting Irish themed varieties featuring Jameson BBQ sauce, Irish bacon, and even a Guinness marinated burger that I look forward to trying on our next visit.  Dwyers features 35 flavors of chicken wings. We have tried and really enjoyed the raspberry BBQ and traditional hot buffalo. Other flavors include wasabi plum, general tso's,  and Jameson BBQ. I was disappointed in the Reuben for its lack of corned beef and the thousand island dressing served on the side, but it was worth the price at only $5.99.
A truly great bar. I've been here hundreds of times. No matter what time of day or day of the week Dwyers is the place to be in North Tonawanda. Ok first of all their beer selection is great it is constantly updated and always fresh. They don't have as many beers on tap as jake's, (which is right across the street) but their beers are always fresh . I only remember one occasion of getting a skunked a beer here and the bartender happily replaced it. What they lack in sheer quantity of tapped beers, in comparison to Jake's, they make up for in their bottled selection. If you combine their selection of bottled beers and tapped I would be willing to bet that they have a much larger beer selection than Jake's.The bartenders are always friendly and quick even on a Friday or Saturday night when they are super busy. On a few occasions they have even gone out of their way to track me down after I've ordered food and thoughtlessly wondered out to the patio. On weekdays they draw enough of a crowd to be socialable but not overwhelming. They have great food too. Plenty of different burgers and sandwiches to select from. If your brave I reccomend the Stinger sandwich, it is a 8 oz steak topped with chicken fingers and cheese. They are best none for their wings which in the buffalo area says alot. They have plenty of different styles to choose from and they are cooked just right. Wing connoisseurs will not be dissapointed. My favorite is the Dwyers Medium its hot sauce and chevettas mixed they are delicious.
Love the outdoor patio-looking fwd to nice weather! Can get crowded-but doesn't popularity mean something? Place worth going. Beers change around seasonally -always like that. More a bar @ night on wkends & pub w food other times. 30+ wing styles! Jameson whiskey wings, Celtic chips or Reuben potato for St Patrick's anyone?! Heck yea!! I love Irish.
I was first introduced to JP Dwyers a year or so ago when a roommate of mine at the time told me they had the best wings in Buffalo. A group of us decided to venture out to Tonawanda and try 'em out for dinner. We ordered 50 wings between the 4 or 5 of us and tried out some of their different flavors, from garlic wings to Hot BBQ to simply hot. Gotta say, they DO have some pretty impressive wings. Was not too much of a fan of the garlic wings, but the hot BBQ and the traditional sauces were very well made. A year later, I still find myself coming back here and recommending this place as an alternative to Duff's/Anchorbar for Wings. I've tried Gabriel's Gate wings and I still think JP Dwyers / Duff's hold the crown. As others have mentioned, the dining area and bar are separate as this place is pretty crazy popular on Friday's/Saturday's. People usually hang around the bar and the dining area will be pretty empty, but you may have to flag down a waitress to seat you as it can get pretty overwhelming. The noise level, even in the other room is one where you'll have to talk very loudly for the person sitting across from you to hear. I suppose that's one of the payoffs for going to a very popular place. Did I mention their 20+ beers on tap? Their selection is great! However, I caution you about ordering the fish and chips. While it's not 'bad,' it's quite uninspired and the fried fish was too salty for my taste. They also do have a veggie wrap on the menu if you have a vegetarian among your mix.. So yeah, popular place with live music on most weekends, great drink variety. If you're around the area, why not pop on in?
North Tonawanda really has some gems, particularly when it comes to pubs and patios.  This is one of those places.  An Irish pub through and through with a HUGE beer selection.  I would estimate close to 20 beers on tap, in addition to a wide selection of bottled beer. The menu is what you would expect for a pub - lots of finger foods, burgers and wraps.  What I appreciate about their menu is their creativity.  I recently tried their "Reuben fries" which consisted of fries smothered in melted swiss, chopped corned beef and sauerkraut, with a side of thousand island dressing.  Although the cheese wasn't very "sharp," overall the dish was greasy deliciousness. ($3.99 for a very large portion!) I can also vouch for their chicken wings. Last but not least, this is in a great location right on Main Street.  The interior is spacious and nothing beats their huge side patio with lots of tables and stools as well as a monster fire pit.  One cool feature about their fire pit is they have a stone ledge encircling the pit which is perfect for sitting and cozying up to the fire.
We had just driven from Wisconsin to Niagara Falls, and my husband was dead set on trying Buffalo Wings in Buffalo, NY (my sis - who would have done the same - was proud of his passion for trying this local fare!) I want to state I am *not* a buffalo wing fan, so I would normally give this place a '3'  just b/c I don't like them... but they were "A-OK!" - But that still seems unfair, as they were good by wing standards... so I give it a four  As, for the execution of one of my not-so-favorite ...foods? they did a great job. Keep in mind you have to order 10 wings per sauce you want to try, so we got 20 wings. While the raspberry bbq wings are among the most popular, they didn't taste like raspberry at all!  Were they somewhat sweet and BBQ-ish? Yes! Were they well-cooked and a bit crunchy on the outside? Yes!  Did my husband adore them? Yes! But still, there was no notable raspberry flavor. The 'suicide bbq' wings aren't really too hot at all, but just hot enough with the added tang of BBQ sauce to be delish!  I ate these up while my hubbie scarfed down the others. Again, they were cooked perfectly, with a little crunch on the outside, and the sauce was great. I ordered the 'Celtic chips' - they really are just chips.  Described as 'deep fried to golden perfection' and coming with the additional option (for $2) of 'cheese, bacon, and sour cream' - I thought they'd be like the bigger wedges of "chips" one gets in the UK - but no.. they were potato chips... However, they really *were* deep friend to golden perfection :D   I couldn't stop eating them. I also ordered the sweet potato fries which was overkill and not worth it. The 'chips' reigned supreme. Oh, and as a healthy added bonus, your wings come with about 4 small strips of celery - so kudos for a hint of veggies ;D It was neat to have tried them, and to see my husband so happy. One American staple, eaten in its place of origin, checked off the list. PS: I only saw 2 waitresses, and it got pretty packed early on a Saturday night, so service was a bit slow. (Don't expect soda refills!)
I'm reviewing this establishment as a bar and not necessarily as a dining experience. I lived relatively close to Dwyers throughout the tail end of my college career and into alumni life. My friends and I, due to the close proximity and quality of the bar,  quickly became regulars. Friday night is traditionally Ladies' Night, featuring $2 drinks after 10 pm. Staff is friendly and does a good job of ensuring everyone receives bar service, even on the busiest of nights. There's a large patio outside with a fire pit that encourages socializing in the summer. I have not utilized Dwyers as a dinner spot, although we have gotten wings and other bar snacks for various friends' birthdays and other occasions. There are a lot of options with wing flavors, which is a fun, unique touch to standard pub fare. I can't speak extensively on this account, but all food we've ordered has been tasty and plentiful. Waiter service has been perfectly acceptable. The staff in general seems to be perfect for the atmosphere: fun, friendly, and fast. It's a bar,  I'm not looking for 3-Michelin star service here. There are a few minor cons. In the winter, when the patio is closed, everyone is forced inside, resulting in an often-stuffy, cramped atmosphere. This only becomes a real problem on nights that the Riviera Theater (next door) has a show, as the bar becomes inundated with patrons that have consistently proven to be poor bar-mates. Despite being regulars, the security guard still gives us problems with ID's (my friends and I are all in our mid-20's). At one point, he insisted my friend was not 5'7" (she is) and she had to argue with him and ask him to get a ruler. It was just an odd experience to have at a place we visit consistently. Still, we've been back dozens of times since, so the issues were obviously not that major.
As a Buffalo native, you might be surprised to hear me say that this in the best place for wings!  The food is great, the beer choices are great, and the wings are top-notch!  You have to try their Dwyer's wings (marinated in Buffalo Chiavetta's sauce; go medium or hot), and my other favorite is the Jameson BBQ.  But if neither of those sound appealing to you then there are 20+ flavors to go for! the flavor destroy's any chain competitor by miles (Buffalo Wild Wings has no place in Buffalo, haha)! Their other food in great too.  Burgers, sandwiches, and especially their loaded or ranch fries (a staple with any of my wing dinner visits). Service is usually pretty good, never bad, but never great; thus I give them 4 out of 5 stars.
By far the best wings around.  They're not overly priced with good drinks.  The crowd can get crazy on weekends when It's warm outside....hence the outside patio area.  One of my first stops when I get back to Buffalo!!! Try the Raspberry Barbecue!!!!
I used to live in the City of Tonawanda, so Dwyers was definitely a cherished spot when my friends and I didn't feel like driving to Buffalo for a night out. They can be very, VERY crowded on the weekend, but nights here in the summer are nice because of the outdoor fire pit and the huge patio. I've never had any of their food--I've only been here for the drinks. They often do a Ladies Night special where drinks are $2, but I've found the drinks are too watered down or overloaded with ice. However, they do not shy away from making any specialty shots. I hate when you go to a bar to ask for something other than a mixed drink and they either stare at you like you have three heads, or simply shut you down with a "we don't do that here." For that, I give Dwyer's a big thumbs up. My friend and I once rented out their upstairs room for a Christmas party, and although it was a little difficult finally getting a hold of the woman, the place was great and we didn't have any problems with bar stragglers trying to sneak their way upstairs. They provided the tables, let us come in early to decorate and the woman in charge was very helpful. I would definitely rate this place a 3 or a 4, depending on the night. In the summer, it's lovely to be outside with friends as inside it can be a little bit too loud and overwhelming. They also have nights with live music so that can be a lot of fun. Sometimes there are a lot of bros on the prowl, but usually they're harmless.
For our first visit to JP Dwyers I have to say I am disappointed with the speed of the kitchen. The appetizers were ordered with our meal & were brought out with the meal 1 hour later!! Our server apologized and did remove a burger that was cooked well done that was supposed to be medium rare. But, there was no excuse for the slow kitchen service. It's unfortunate as the hot Cajun wings were very good. I will definitely be apprehensive about coming back to JP Dwyers.
Stopped in here for some wings and a beer. Bartenders were friendly and wings were on special, so we ordered a few to try. Wings were really good so they lived up to the hype. Good stop for people watching and they had a good draft beer selection.
A cloud of blue smoke greeted us yesterday as we walked into the dining room.  The TVs were blaring commercials; I think the bar was quieter... All 4 of us had burgers, they were huge and very tasty.  The food almost offset the noise and dirty ladies room on a Sunday at 5:00 pm when the Bills weren't playing- I said almost.
After reading about Dwyer's on one of the "best wing" lists here on Yelp, I knew I had to check it out. This was my first time to North Tonawanda and I was really impressed by the area - a nice strip of shops, restaurants, and the Riviera Theater. The restaurant itself was PACKED! I didn't think cheap booze and wings could attract such a crowd - then I found out there was a Beatles cover band playing the theater next door. Dwyer's is known for their variety of sauces for their chicken wings. I went with the house special, aka raspberry bbq. I did like how there was an option to order 15 wings, instead of the usual 10,20,etc. However, I did not like that you could not split either size 10 or 15 with more than one sauce. The raspberry wings hit the spot. Sweet and heavy with sauce you definitely need to ask for extra napkins. Also went with a side of the homemade celtic (potato) chips fully loaded with sour cream, cheese, and bacon. Though they were a bit soggy and didn't live up to the expectation. Overall, Dwyer's is a great place to meet friends, make friends, and chow down on serious wings. I'll be back next time to try the cajun wings.
You have to absolutely try the raspberry bbq wings, they are the most unique wings I've ever had!
Let me just start this out by saying that I will eventually end up editing this review several times as I will be back here to try more wing flavors and beers. The first time I went here very recently I went mainly to try the wings. An article was recently released that listed the ten best wings in WNY besides Anchor Bar and Duff's and this place was on the list. I never really knew much about this place before that which is sad because this restaurant isn't too far from where I live. Anyways, this place was noted for having many different flavors of wings besides the traditional flavors. I really came mostly for the wings on this particular trip so I just glanced over the beer and drink menu but didn't order anything from it. The beer selection seemed pretty decent. I had a tough choice picking out the wing flavors I wanted to try because there are so many but I went with 10 of the raspberry BBQ and 10 of the spicy sesame. I also decided to order the stinger sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries since I've noticed in the past that wings often go better with other food rather than by themselves. The food came in a timely fashion and I dove right into my meal. The raspberry BBQ wings were really good while the spicy sesame were okay but had a taste that was very similar to Chinese takeout. I kind of expected that for the sesame flavor though. The stinger was really good. However, the steak on it was whole and very thick and it was difficult to fit my mouth around and bite into. I would prefer chopped or thinner cut steak when on a sandwich but that's just a personal preference of mine. The stinger sandwich was very good nonetheless. The sweet potato fries were very good and were served with some kind of honey butter which I thought was a perfect dipping sauce to accompany them. The friend I went here with also got some sort of hard cider drink which I sampled---okay drank half of! Ha ha. That seemed to be a really great drink pick. I have to sample the drink menu a little more on my next stop here. I was honestly enjoying my meal quite a bit going back and forth between my wings, sandwich, and fries. The restaurant definitely has that neighborhood bar feel and is a cool place to hang out. Overall, a good experience. Congratulations Dwyer's Pub your extensive array of wing flavors has extorted me into coming back here!

Oh, Dwyers. I have a love/hate relationship with this place. It's a dive, so let's start there. I've been here on ladies night where it was all-you-can-drink everything served in those plastic cups they give you at Pizza Hut when you dine in. The waitresses wear short plaid skirts and black tank tops. It's supposed to be an Irish bar, but the charm of other Irish places just seems to be missing. It's like a college bar, except without the college students. So, you may be asking- why three stars then? The patio is great. They frequently have live music. The lone guy with his guitar there this weekend was fantastic (although I did feel bad for him because it didn't seem like anyone was listening to him). They have a lovely fire pit. The bartenders are friendly. The drinks are cheap. Somehow, we end up here more often than I'd like. Yet, it's not a bad place really. Just not anything worth going out of your way for.
This has always been one of my favorite Webster St. bars. Dwyer's has been home to all the local crowds looking for a fun Irish pub. Dwyer's has also been cranking out some of the best chicken wings in the area. They have over 10 flavors to choose from. The beer list is fantastic, especially considering the area.

None-the-less this bar is still a great choice for Traditional Irish ambiance and good bar food. They Reuben-ize everything you can imagine - from sandwiches to fries, to potato skins and more. Yum! A few years ago the patio war began as I refer to it - Crazy Jakes vs. Dwyer's - who came out on top? I would honestly say both. These bars are completely different in what they offer but both patios are outstanding (both have huge fire pits). The best in the area. Dwyer's has been around longer so I tend to favor them however, if you're looking for a more contemporary bar go to Crazy Jakes. Whatever it is that you're looking for either one of these bars is sure to provide. Both are great stops for live outdoor music as well - this area of Tonawanda/North Tonawanda itself is known for great outdoor venues.

A MUST checkout for people who love their beer and wings (anyone from Buffalo).
Dwyer's has always been a favorite of mine, for food, nightlife and entertainment! The bar is always happening on the weekends, they frequently have live bands/DJ's and a great outdoor patio. The food is awesome, for bar food anyways. My husband and I like to visit Dwyers whenever we are craving a cheeseburger and the pretzel sticks are a must order for an appetizer, YUM! The draft selection is also decent, but if you are looking for a lot of different craft beers try Crazy Jake's down the street. Definitely worth a visit if you are in the North Tonawanda area!
I don't live too far from JP Dwyer's, and damn I'm glad. This place is awesome. It has a great selection of beers and even lets you sample, when deciding on trying something new. (just ask).

Everything I've had has been great. The burgers are tasty and always cooked the way I request them. Lots of varieties of wings, all very good. The steak sandwich is exceptional.  A filet, not shaved steak. Cooked to perfection and tender. Well worth it. Very consistent results from the kitchen.  Solid selection of beers and the service is usually pretty great. Overall, it's hard to go wrong here.
Wings were very good but very expensive and they charge for certain sauces. Blah. The burger bun was very large so they made the burger so flat so it wasn't my preferred thickness. It was a good burger though. I was told to get a stinger sandwich next time.
wings and sandwiches are really good! They have  a large variety of chicken wing sauces to choice from. Service is just ok...i ask all the time for more flats then drumsticks and they never accommodate.
By far, the best all around bar in WNY. The best food and drinks. Great service and entertainment. Band or DJ, doesn't matter its a fun environment. I am glad i do not live near by because i would be there every night. Best and most chicken wing flavors i have seen anywhere. Great place to let loose.

This only becomes a real problem on nights that the Riviera Theater (next door) has a show, as the bar becomes inundated with patrons that have consistently proven to be poor bar-mates. Despite being regulars, the security guard still gives us problems with ID's (my friends and I are all in our mid-20's). At one point, he insisted my friend was not 5'7" (she is) and she had to argue with him and ask him to get a ruler. It was just an odd experience to have at a place we visit consistently. Still, we've been back dozens of times since, so the issues were obviously not that major.
Best wings I've had in a while! You also have to try the Mac and cheese bites and pretzel sticks. The bartender, Nick, was very friendly!
By far the best wings around.  They're not overly priced with good drinks.  The crowd can get crazy on weekends when It's warm outside....hence the outside patio area.  One of my first stops when I get back to Buffalo!!! Try the Raspberry Barbecue!!!!
We have been to Dwyer's on two occasions. It's a great place to watch the Sabre's game and enjoy some great bar food. The bar offers a good mix of draft beers and features local brews. They offer deals on drinks for all Sabre's games and prices are very reasonable.  Their Celtic chips are made in house and definitely worth trying.  We have also tried the jalapeno poppers stuffed with cream cheese served with a raspberry dipping sauce. They were delicious! Far better than the traditional cheddar poppers. Their 12 oz burgers are huge and come in some interesting Irish themed varieties featuring Jameson BBQ sauce, Irish bacon, and even a Guinness marinated burger that I look forward to trying on our next visit.  Dwyers features 35 flavors of chicken wings. We have tried and really enjoyed the raspberry BBQ and traditional hot buffalo. Other flavors include wasabi plum, general tso's,  and Jameson BBQ. I was disappointed in the Reuben for its lack of corned beef and the thousand island dressing served on the side, but it was worth the price at only $5.99.
For our first visit to JP Dwyers I have to say I am disappointed with the speed of the kitchen. The appetizers were ordered with our meal & were brought out with the meal 1 hour later!! Our server apologized and did remove a burger that was cooked well done that was supposed to be medium rare. But, there was no excuse for the slow kitchen service. It's unfortunate as the hot Cajun wings were very good. I will definitely be apprehensive about coming back to JP Dwyers.
A truly great bar. I've been here hundreds of times. No matter what time of day or day of the week Dwyers is the place to be in North Tonawanda. Ok first of all their beer selection is great it is constantly updated and always fresh. They don't have as many beers on tap as jake's, (which is right across the street) but their beers are always fresh . I only remember one occasion of getting a skunked a beer here and the bartender happily replaced it. What they lack in sheer quantity of tapped beers, in comparison to Jake's, they make up for in their bottled selection. If you combine their selection of bottled beers and tapped I would be willing to bet that they have a much larger beer selection than Jake's.The bartenders are always friendly and quick even on a Friday or Saturday night when they are super busy. On a few occasions they have even gone out of their way to track me down after I've ordered food and thoughtlessly wondered out to the patio. On weekdays they draw enough of a crowd to be socialable but not overwhelming. They have great food too. Plenty of different burgers and sandwiches to select from. If your brave I reccomend the Stinger sandwich, it is a 8 oz steak topped with chicken fingers and cheese. They are best none for their wings which in the buffalo area says alot. They have plenty of different styles to choose from and they are cooked just right. Wing connoisseurs will not be dissapointed. My favorite is the Dwyers Medium its hot sauce and chevettas mixed they are delicious.
A cloud of blue smoke greeted us yesterday as we walked into the dining room.  The TVs were blaring commercials; I think the bar was quieter... All 4 of us had burgers, they were huge and very tasty.  The food almost offset the noise and dirty ladies room on a Sunday at 5:00 pm when the Bills weren't playing- I said almost.
Love the outdoor patio-looking fwd to nice weather! Can get crowded-but doesn't popularity mean something? Place worth going. Beers change around seasonally -always like that. More a bar @ night on wkends & pub w food other times. 30+ wing styles! Jameson whiskey wings, Celtic chips or Reuben potato for St Patrick's anyone?! Heck yea!! I love Irish.
You have to absolutely try the raspberry bbq wings, they are the most unique wings I've ever had!
