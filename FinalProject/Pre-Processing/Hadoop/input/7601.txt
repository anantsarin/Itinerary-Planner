We love this salon! My daughters and I go here. The owner is so friendly and remembers you by name even if it's been awhile. Tony is especially good and my daughters ask for him every time! They are friendly and professional. My pedicures are very good quality and relaxing. Aaaahhhh!
Amazing service and attention to detail. Did  mani-pedi for my wedding day and they looked fantastic!!!
Great place! I've been looking for a good nail salon since I moved here 2 years ago. Wish I'd been here earlier! I just left w pretty toes, no hangnails, a kit to take home for interim use and to bring back with me, and a loyalty rewards card. I couldn't be happier.
Not even  hello how are you, rude people and last time I got a pedicure it was short and not so good.
I love this salon!  They are so friendly and do an excellent job.
They are fantastic!  They use clean instruments fresh out of the package!  We are always greeted at the door and by name!  The owners live in the neighborhood and take great pride in servicing their neighbors with professionalism and friendship at the same time!  Totally friendly and a wonderful neighborhood salon!  I have a feeling the negative reviews below are the unfriendly competition!
my friend introduces the shop to me. Got there 3 weeks ago. The woman who did my acrylic nails has very poor skill.  Moon is her name. She kept convincing me to switch to gel nail. After 1 week, my nails were all leak and hurt. Never happen before!!!
