Twenty-five years ago, my boyfriend (now husband) lived across the street from this place, so it was a staple. A couple of weeks ago, I was visiting with the family and needed a quick bite.  I'm glad to say Shortstop hasn't lost its touch.  My only regret is that I forgot to tell them to toast my bun.   All in all, good food, good value! Still an Ithaca tradition!
Pretty good sandwiches, and it's cool that they never close, so there's always a serviceable food option in town at all times. You order by filling out a little form and handing it to one of the sandwich makers, instead of taking a number or explaining to them what you want. In that sense, I guess it's a little more efficient. But I personally find this place to be kinda slow, considering how many people they have working. Sandwiches themselves are pretty expensive though, compared to delis in other cities. Plus, you have to pay for cheese here, which I've never seen done anywhere else. My staple sandwich everywhere is a large pastrami with cheese, which is like $11 here, when I could get that back home for $7. They also have some of the Hot Truck sandwiches, but since I'm not a fan of Hot Truck, I haven't tried them here. But if you are craving them, you can always come here when the truck is closed.
I love this place, but at the same time it's not the type of place that I would suggest for everyone. It's a dirty secret that everybody knows about. The food is heavy, greasy, and completely perfect. It's a hedonistic hole in the wall (no not that kind). You go to Shortstop either after a night of drinking, or after your 12 hour shift has ended and just don't care anymore. Shortstop offers very limited seating, but that's okay because after you've eaten here you won't be able to sit up anyway (I would suggest getting takeout and eating in bed). My personal favorite sandwich is the SUI which is a 12 inch garlic bread sub with tomato sauce, mozzarella, peperoni, mushrooms, and ground sausage (I usually add bacon too, just for good measure). As Ithaca's only dedicated 24 hour deli, Shortstop is an Ithacan mainstay; let's hope it never changes!
I come here mainly for their Hot Truck sandwiches which definitely aren't for everyone unless they love melted cheese, meat, and grease drenched in sauce smashed in a crispy, fresh loaf that will become soggy in a blink of an eye if its not eaten fast enough. That said, they're so good I've never been able to eat them slowly except for the one time I got a Grand Slam. I'm glad to say it was good cold and reheated too. I've only ordered the SUI since I first tried it years ago but I've also sampled the others by stealing bites. If you only ever have one opportunity to eat at Shortstop and aren't too health-conscious, get the SUI+truck sauce and you won't be disappointed. As a byproduct of growing up in a city, I expect and dread overpriced deli goods, but Shortstop is dirt cheap for its quality and size. As another plus, the employees at both the Deli and the truck are very friendly and quick.
The grand slam sandwiches are big and easily feed two people. We tried the cheese steak and roast beef. There are lots of items ( lettuce, pickles, etc..) from which to customize your sandwich and the drinks are cheap -29 cents for a large drink with sandwich purchase. The staff was friendly and patiently explained how to place the order.
AMAZING. Everything is perfection. This place beats all restaurants in Ithaca, even if it is a deli.
Oh yum yum yum, shortstop deli. Think Wawa in the sense that it makes sandwiches to order, but the sandwiches taste better. I ordered a pizza sub with meatballs and cheese (MBC) and it was so delicious! This place has a cool retro feel to it, too, and open 24 hours. A plus for the late night munchies!
I've passed this place a ton of times. To me, it looks sort of like a gas station/convenience mart and I imagined hot dogs on rollers and rotating pieces of day old cheese pizza. Imagine my surprise to read all the positive reviews on Yelp! The pizza subs-- ok these are not anything to write home about but I do see why late-nighters would go crazy for these off of the Hot Truck. The Sui satisfies. Loaded with sausage and mushrooms, a-ok. The reuben? Now this was actually pretty impressive. I have had far inferior reubens in sit-down restaurants. A nice balance of all the components allows you to taste all the ingredients with nothing getting drowned out. It's nice to pop into a place, order some reasonably priced made to-order-food and get out quick. The staff was really nice. You can get a 16 or 24 oz. fountain drink for $0.09 when you order a sandwhich/sub. Cool.
Awesome sub shop with great late night food.  My friends and I used to come here all the time while in school, and we made sure to stop in again while we were all in Ithaca for homecoming.   I love getting the BBQ beef (the pulled pork is also awesome).  I think the Double is the best value (skip the Single), but if you're really hungry, a Grand Slam goes a long way. Don't forget the 9 cent fountain drink if you buy a sandwich!
After about 3:00am, all the other late night food establishments close (except for a few diners) leaving this decent sandwich shop as your only option. Be careful though, their menu is designed to take advantage of drunk customers, so circle the extra items to be added to your sandwich as wisely as your alcohol sloshed brain can. As a general rule of thumb, go with the the pizza or breakfast subs. They are tasty greasy concoction that is just what you want at 3:00am. The farther you deviate from these items the more your sandwich will taste like subway.
A sandwich lover's dream, Shortstop Deli is another late night place for lucky Ithacans. Everything sold here is top notch, great breads, lunch meats, cheeses, toppings, and even condiments too. Opened 24/7 Shortstop deli has great sandwiches and even caters to the vegans and vegetarians. I had a BBQed seitan sandwich with slaw and pickles. The seitan was porky, tender and flavorful. The Godson had the Rubin on rye with a side of fries that could have fed his entire frat house (Kappa Sig). Excellent food and not just to soak up the alcohol, these are great sandwiches and a great place. I always wanted to go for a breakfast sandwich but it's so packed with Ithaca College and Cornell students, but the locals say they have good breakfasts and coffee. Buy one of their TShirts!
I don't know how I slept on reviewing shortstop deli! I have likely eaten here close to if not exceeding 1000 times in my life and have never been disappointed.   This is a MUST stop in Ithaca.  They acquired Hot Truck a few years back, another ithaca institution (R.I.P. Bob) and their french bread pizza is not to be missed either. The amount of seitan they put on the subs can't possibly make them any money, its an enormous portion!  And the vegan burger is really good as well, but I can't place the brand. In regards to Lisa D's complaint, if you get a toasted or hot sub, its going to take an extra 5 minutes to go through the oven.  Even when they are slammed I don't think i've ever waited more than 10 minutes. Considering you can get a sub the size of your head with a 32oz drink for under $10, with fresh baked bread, I can't think of a single reason not to go here (unless you are gluten free, then you are right screwed)
I think, because I live in a Sandwich mecca, I just cant give Shortstop a perfect 5. The concept and execution is top notch, but the actual food, while above average, just doesnt hit Paesano levels. It's a similar concept to Wawa, with their "No human interaction" method of ordering food. While Wawa is high tech, with their touch screen, Shortstop keeps it real with a golf pencil and order form. I thouroughly enjoyed my Reuben and others in my large group seemed to be pleased as well. Staff was efficient and pleasant , prices were reasonable. I find myself in Ithaca a few times a year, which means you will find me at Shortstop as many times, as well.Good Stuff.
How can you make Hot Truck better? Simple, take something real cheap and knock $2 off the price. During the summer they're running a special from 4-8 pm where every sandwich is $2 off. Given how inexpensive Truck is to begin with, coupled in with 32 oz. sodas for a quarter, you have dinner for 2 at under $8. I loves me my Hot Truck, and if you're ever looking for a good wine to pair with it, try "Uncle Charlie" from Lakeshore Winery just up Cayuga Lake. Yes, pairing Hot Truck with a blush wine will not make the pages of cullinary excellence, but in my defense I was 21 at the time we made this discovery. Note - computer ordering kiosks are gone. That seemed a little odd given SS's old school order slip system. You can, however, place an order online and pick it up in store. Given how rapidly Ithaca (or at least Route 13) has changed this decade, it's nice to see some things keeping it old school...
Shortstop Deli is a food counter located inside a grimy convenience store. They only have a couple vegan options (namely the vegan burger and a seitan sandwich), but it's good enough, considering that they're cheap, fast and open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. I had a seitan sandwich ($6.43 with tax) (which you can customize by filling out a card). I got it with just basic vegetables (lettuce, onions, tomatoes) and no condiments. Also, they have a wholewheat bread option, which I took. The sandwich was pretty damn good. It's kind of small, but it was stuffed with finely-shredded, high-grade seitan. It looked and tasted uncannily like roast beef, which is a good or bad thing, depending on your tastes. I really loved that they caramelized the onions, which added a more complex flavor to what could have been a simple dish; I also greatly enjoyed the wholewheat bread, which was fluffy, fresh and just felt substantial. It wasn't throwaway bread you get on a shelf in the grocery store. All in all, this is a good place to get a quick, tasty meal. I can't wait to try their vegan burger. If they had more vegan options, I'd give them another star.
Way overpriced. Out of the way (sort of) But good for a one time sandwich. Got the Ithaca Steak sub, it was good. Love that it's toasted.
Pizza sub?  need i say more?  Messy eating but great subs.  I never remember what i got the last time so i always end up with a new sub.  This time i got the SUI?  Garlic bread, pizza sauce, sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms and then asked for all the vegetables.  A small usually does me good for the day but some of the larger guys were getting the grand slams.   There is really no seating inside the shop.  You basically order your food, hand the white copy to the people making your subs, and you take the yellow carbon copy to the cash register and pay.  They call you by name to get your sub, you pick it up and go outside and sit on the "benches" outside to eat.
Crack in a cup.  It's CRACK IN A CUP, people.  Do I really need to tell you anything else? Shortstop has a tremendous menu of delicious sandwiches, made to order, with any combination of condiments and toppings you can imagine.  For veggie lovers, the seitan sandwich is just as filling and protein-packed as any meat sandwich you can find anywhere - AND it's tasty!  There's also Hot Truck Pizza, a ton of different soups, and mac-n-cheese. Now, a far warning: you will be addicted to the mac-n-cheese upon first bite.  In fact, you don't even need to taste this amazing delicacy - you just need to lift the lid off its vat and run the giant scooper spoon through the hot, buttery, cheesy concoction below, and you will be hooked. Hooked!  I would encourage anyone on a strict diet to just avoid the soup/mac-n-cheese area completely. You will get drawn in, and you will not be able to control yourself.  Drunk people should be especially careful - I can easily see myself stumbling out into the kitchen on the night after a bender and finding 20 little cups with congealed cheese stuck to their sides.   It is that good. Seriously.
Mmmmmmmmmmmmm Shortstop is soooooo good. That crunchy bread, the cheesey, gooey mess of pepperoni and tomato sauce. So many great choices for different sandwiches. The garlic bread they give you the sandwiches on are amazing. 79 cent sodas are a HUGE plus. The sandwiches themselves are a little pricey, def more than your 5 dollar footlong from subway, but subway could never taste like this. Watch out for the grease, it goes right through the paper bags. I got some on my jeans last time :( Sui, Pmp, all good. If you don't know what I'm talking about, hurry up and get your butts to Shortstop.
You can't go wrong with Shortstop Deli. It's like a Sheetz or WaWa... but with MUCH better food, and MUCH bigger portions. I don't know how they do it, but prices are very reasonable for the portion size offered, and they offer dirt cheap fountain beverages with purchase of any sandwich. The Hot Truck pizza subs are good too - however, at some point they discontinued using real sausage links on the "SUI" in favor of ground sausage, which, for me, just isn't the same.
This deli is still pretty awesome, even more so now that it's freezing cold in Ithaca and their toasty subs are available at the odd hour. Don't forget to pick up the 24ounce drinks for 9cents offer when you order any sandwich, their cups are also eco-friendly. Win Win?
"Sui" That is all you need to know when you come here.  It is to die for and delicious in every cheesy and meaty way.  I feel my feel every artery clogging me but it is worth it because it is that GOOD!
2am.  The bars have closed.  You're hungry and you know you have no food back at your dorm (or hotel room as it's now the case).  Where do you go?  Hot Truck!  Where do you go when Hot Truck is closed in the summer?  Shortstop!   Shortstop is a great convenience store/deli that serves subs, pizza and sandwiches to order.  It's always crowded late at night and you will most likely run into many people you know here.  It's where everyone goes.  They make a good deli sandwich and their Hot Truck food is just as good as the Hot Truck itself.  PMP anyone?   Shortstop blows away Subway and Quiznos.
I hate this place. But it's the only eating place in walking distance that's open 24 hours. The loiterers ain't friendly, the sandwiches dismal and the drink selection leaves one wanting, but it's a good spot to score some string cheese.
24/7 yumminess! The seitan sandwich is the greatest! I've tried so hard to make something as close to as awesome as this, but I don't come close!   I change my toppings and dressing depending what mood I'm.  But yeah, pick your bread, choice of meat (or SEITAN!), toppings, sauce, toast it or not, and you've got yourself an excellent sandwich! The only thing that could make this place better would be delivery.
Great subs and sandwiches (try the pizza sandwiches!), open 24 hours.  Even the bread (which they bake themselves) is delicious. Be forewarned that it's a convenience-store setting, and there's nowhere to sit.  Still a great place to grab a delicious (though certainly not low-cal) sandwich.
Great sandwiches for night owls and people on the run. However, no one takes your order, so be sure to grab an order slip, choose your sandwich and toppings, and hand it to the person working the deli. My first time there I waited around for quite sometime before I realized how things worked.
This is my 2nd go to place for subs other than Wegmans. The meat and veggies are awesome and fresh, better than anything I've had yet and the bread is amazing. The only reason I like Wegmans better is because Wegman's everything bread is seriously the best....well...actually DiBella's everything bread is the best but that's beside the point. This place has amazing subs for decent prices. They are about as much as everyone else but the .09 cent drink with your sandwich makes this place absolutely my number one pick when I need a sub. Plus they are open 24/7 365 days a year? Whenever I want a roast beef sub I can get it! This place is seriously the best you gotta check them out!
This. Deli. Is. Great. I also disagree about slow service. You have to wait a second when sandwiches are made to order, especially if they are hot. And even at that, you will only wait several minuets, so relax :) Even if the sandwiches were less generous and the soda fountain price was not so ridiculous (buy a sandwich and add a huge soda for 10 cents?!) I don't even drink soda, but a good cherry Pepsi compliments a turkey Reuben very, very well...   I love that they are open 24 hours~ This place is an institution here for a reason. The owner cares about the quality of his ingredients and consistency; that is evident. Gonna miss this sandwich shop when I move!
Reuben, tender corned beef, wonderful amount of sauerkraut. No sog to the bread. Pizza sub thing was tasty, it escapes me why it was a highlighted item. Lucky find, best kettle chips ever, spicy dill and horseradish cheddar. Ordering is a little confusing, even though I guess it's straight forward; grab a slip and circle what you want.
I've gone to short stop all my life the sandwiches are the best in Ithaca but bring your money cause it can be quit expensive
We each had a seitan sub. Delicious! Friendly service and an efficient ordering process. We're from out of town, but this is a new favorite for us and we'll definitely be back.
I stopped at the Shortstop Deli for a sandwich for the road.  It's a pretty popular place, so even during the middle of the afternoon on a Saturday, I had a bit of wait to receive my food.  They have a wide selection of sandwiches, both hot and cold.  I decided to order a cold pastrami wrap with cole slaw, sweet peppers and Russian dressing.  The food was delicious, and certainly worth considering the next time I'm in Ithaca.
Where else can you get a seitan sandwich and a 40oz of Gatorade at 2am?  NOWHERE!  I miss you, Shortstop.
Everyone keeps calling this place a convenience store when I know ya'll are coming here for the sandwiches... so why don't we call it a Sandwich Shop equipped with a bountiful selection of drinks, chips, tire parts and hygiene products that is open 24/7? When you walk in, grab a pencil and menu form from the counter and check the boxes of what you're craving. There are three different forms, one for breakfast sandwiches, Deli Sandwiches and Hot Truck. Each sandwich comes in three different sizes Single, Double and Grand Slam.  I ordered the Pmp "Poor Man's Pizza", which consists of tomato sauce & mozzarella on toasted French Bread and added mushrooms. I usually add chicken but last time I thought I'd go nuts and added pepperoni, so much tastier. My friend ordered a Turkey sandwich on whole wheat French bread; it was pretty amazing. The whole wheat French bread shouldn't be overlooked. The fountain sodas here are ridiculously cheap but too bad they're Pepsi products otherwise I would have actually purchased one. The sandwiches range from $5-10 but the add-ons (like veggies, meat etc) will sneak up on you like a peeping Tom. *First are cheese fries.
We've been in Ithaca for almost 2 years and this is the one food place I will yearn for when we leave. It probably hasn't been the most healthy tradition to eat a pizza sub every Sunday night, but it has definitely been delicious. Also, the toasted subs are pretty great too.
This place likely only does any kind of business because it is pretty much the only place open in the wee hours of the morning.  It takes an incredibly long time to get a simple sandwich, not just because Ithaca is the midwest of NY, but also because everyone is ordering french bread pizzas which require more prep work.  After waiting an unduly long time for a simple turkey sandwich, I was pretty disappointed because it was worse than Subway--soggy bread and lettuce, pale tomatos, average turkey.  This place is a reminder that the cuisine in Ithaca was atrocious not too long ago..
It's been 12 years since I graduated, but I still look forward to Shortstop whenever I visit Ithaca.  Great hot sandwiches, and you can even get your Hot Truck fix here if you're too lazy to make your way over to West Campus.
I really want to like Shortstop. I work close to them, I like sandwiches. the pros: good sandwiches, good service. the cons: expensive sandwiches. no seating. I end up eating there once a year, on a nice day in the summer when I can sit outside. Every other time I think about eating there, I remember that there's nowhere to sit, and the sandwiches are expensive and I go somewhere else. And they try to make you fat by practically giving away soda. I think it's funny, when you go to their website, they have a big "invest" button, and you can read their ideas about their business. And that they make 50% profit on the sandwiches. Maybe they'd make actually more money if they priced the sandwiches competitively to other places. Just sayin.
The last decent 24 hour place to eat in Ithaca. The reuben and the SUI are both delicious. The upfront investment is a little expensive, but even the single sandwiches are pretty big. They have quite an extensive array of toppings as well e.g. cole slaw. Also no seating area inside.
What a great sandwich shop! There are so many sandwiches to choose from and most of them (from my experience) are quite simple awesome. They have a sandwich for whatever you crave. Great prices and sandwiches that will leave you satisfied and happy.
Had the Sui, sausage, pepperoni, tomato sauce, cheese on garlic bread. Good combination and tasty. 12 bucks for a Grand Slam...pretty pricey for a foot long. The sandwich maker was not attentive to my sandwich and somewhat messy. I guess that's what you would expect from a convenience store.
Have the Sui (Soo Wee, like Suicide) with the works...and dont miss the truck sauce. Order the double size and be prepared to not eat for three days. It is the Hot Truck, day or night with the inexpensive soda throw in for pocket change. We love these sandwiches so much, we are members of the "club" that allows you free sandwiches after you eat so much. Their hot sandwiches start on garlic bread...and build from there whether you want it simple (with cheese) or loaded with meat and veggies. It is one of the few incentives I can use with my gigantic and ever-hungry children to have them run errands with me. "Shortstop?" always elicits  a resounding "YES!".
excellent late-night food in the wee-hours of the night and great for a quick stop if you are an out-of-towner on your way in to check out the city and the local falls. there's not much seating, but if you're by yourself or with a couple of people, you can eat outside next to the windows. i can't vouch for the sketchiness at night (if i was there after midnight during my college years, i was most likely drunk and in no condition to judge my surroundings). but they still make a tasty sandwich. i have to disagree about the drink selection. anytime wild cherry pepsi is available, i'm totally satisfied with the drink selection. and gatorade? c'mon, where else are you going to find that in fountain form? for 10 cents no less.
If I'm comparing this to other sandwich shops and delis, it does well. Great selection, pretty quick service and decent staff. If I'm comparing it to Hot Truck, I don't think it fares so well. If you are trying to replicate the Hot Truck experience at a store, don't. Wait until late at night, haul your ass up to campus and do the real thing. If, however, you are having a Hot Truck craving during a time when Hot Truck is closed, just realize that the sandwiches don't taste exactly the same (something to be said about the ancient hot truck oven) and the menu in the deli only has a select few of the Hot Truck sandwiches). As long as you accept those limitations, you're OK.
Their sandwiches are very hearty and meaty. The kind of sandwich you would crave when you are starving.  Everything is pretty good.  I remember my first sandwich was a Reuben and I thought it was just off the wall phenomenal.  I've proceeded to try almost all their other sandwiches and I still think the Reuben is the best although the roast beef is a close second.  They are very generous with their portion. Its almost always hard to eat without spilling toppings every which way.  This place helped enriched my college experience. One of the many jewels in Ithaca. I miss you already. I WISH YOU DELIVERED THOUGH.
At the corner of pizza and subs lives Shortstop Deli. It's very very good. But why anyone would order anything beyond a pizza sub is beyond me. Unless one is a vegan, and then one can complain that seitan, vegan burger, hummus and assorted veggies are not enough of a vegan selection, because the world needs to bow down to your food aversion. If there's anything else you can do to exert your superiority over the rest of the planet, I can't wait to hear it. Allow me to recommend scouring the parking lot for gravel, which is a very safe vegan treat. Or just order a SUI and pray none of your friends see you.
Short Stop Deli delivers. Great sandwiches, a wide selection and bread baked on sight. This places never closes 24/7/365 and they love to supply athletic teams that are visiting the area. Good, fresh and user friendly, a great deal for good deli delights. Rock-on Short Stop!
A must try for all Ithacans and visitors. The Hot Truck sandwiches live on - delish!
Their ordering system had me a little flustered but I guess that's part of the fun. I thought the PMP was pretty awesome--and I like that you can custome order down to the last detail.
We have stopped here several times on our way to Binghamton or on the way back.  Great hot or cold sandwiches.  Drinks are practically free with a sandwich.  Service is usually pretty quick.  It can be busy though.  It's nice to find a place that also toasts the bread if you desire. Outside seating if weather permits.
I feel the need to chime in and emphasize that this is not just for late night drunks. It is also an excellent place to get a sub for lunch or dinner. The bread is awesome and I've never had a bad sub from there. Love the ordering system too because it ensure that I can order exactly what I want without sounding/feeling like a pain in the ass. However, check your food before you go. Often they forget toppings. I always go here when I am back in Ithaca!
Oh, Short Stop, how I miss getting drunk munchies at 2AM in the sketchiest block of town at your place. I didn't care that there were drug addicts loitering in the area, I didn't care if I had to walk across town or trek up or down hills in -10 degree weather and 2 feet of snow; your PMP's with pepperoni, mushrooms, and banana peppers were worth all the troubles to get to you or The Hot Truck! You paired with a Magic Hat #9 were a match made in heaven when I was a young lass. I don't know how I survive a night on the town without you to give me my Saturday night hangover remedy anymore. Nothing compares to the greatness of the Shortstop Deli or The Hot Truck! I just wish there was a place like you in Boulder! But knowing Boulder, I don't think they'll be able to create anything so divetastic as you. You bet when I visit Ithaca, I'll be stumbling in here once again after a night at Korova (ahem, The Westy). Keep doing what you do and don't change one thing about you; Short Stop, you're perfect!
Excellent made to order sub shop...  A favorite for late night food!
Who doesn't love a pizza sandwich at 2 am? Although I do agree with the previous review, the beverage selection is pretty crappy despite it's large size.
I don't know where I would be without you, Shortstop.
Pretty convenient being open at all hours. My sandwich was also good so I would recommend this place so far.
A local landmark worth at least several late night exploratory ventures.  Late at night the hot truck items change from being disgusting grease logs to... exactly what I'm looking for.  The breakfast sandwiches are a secret pleasure of mine, but I'd never get them at full price ($2.00 off between 5am to 10am).   Just be aware that shortstop isn't as cheap as it might seem.  I recall paying almost $20 for a large bbq sandwich, which was tasty but at that price a full pizza would have made more sense.
It's a great place for a midnight snack run.  Their menu was relatively basic with some vegan options.  They have 2 freezers full of ice cream truck style ice cream.  The service was quick and friendly.  No tables to sit down and eat.  I had the poor man's pizza and loved it!
cat sandwich munchies for the late night!
Exactly what two stars means: "meh. I've experienced better". Really not great. Lacked flavor, very average. Bread was above average, meat lacked seasoning on the roast beef. Very slow service, and below average on the friendly scale. Imagine wawa or quick check with a sense of entitlement. This review comes from an out of owner with no agenda.
c'mon it's short stop.  they make sandwiches that are larger than your arm and have not closed their doors for 22 years...  if you're looking for a refined experience go somewhere else.  if it's 3 am and you need a turkey reuben that will make you loosen your belt at least one notch, go to short stop.  it's 24/7/365.
Open 24 hours. Service is good, and quick as well. The ordering system is quick and efficient and the drinks are really cheap with a sandwich. The real reason for the 5 stars is the ice cream in the summer. Best soft serve in Ithaca with a nice place to sit outside and enjoy.
Where else can you get a seitan sandwich and a 40oz of Gatorade at 2am?  NOWHERE!  I miss you, Shortstop.

Oh, Short Stop, how I miss getting drunk munchies at 2AM in the sketchiest block of town at your place. I didn't care that there were drug addicts loitering in the area, I didn't care if I had to walk across town or trek up or down hills in -10 degree weather and 2 feet of snow; your PMP's with pepperoni, mushrooms, and banana peppers were worth all the troubles to get to you or The Hot Truck! You paired with a Magic Hat #9 were a match made in heaven when I was a young lass. I don't know how I survive a night on the town without you to give me my Saturday night hangover remedy anymore. Nothing compares to the greatness of the Shortstop Deli or The Hot Truck! I just wish there was a place like you in Boulder! But knowing Boulder, I don't think they'll be able to create anything so divetastic as you. You bet when I visit Ithaca, I'll be stumbling in here once again after a night at Korova (ahem, The Westy). Keep doing what you do and don't change one thing about you; Short Stop, you're perfect!
Excellent made to order sub shop...  A favorite for late night food!
Who doesn't love a pizza sandwich at 2 am? Although I do agree with the previous review, the beverage selection is pretty crappy despite it's large size.
I don't know where I would be without you, Shortstop.
Pretty convenient being open at all hours. My sandwich was also good so I would recommend this place so far.
A local landmark worth at least several late night exploratory ventures.  Late at night the hot truck items change from being disgusting grease logs to... exactly what I'm looking for.  The breakfast sandwiches are a secret pleasure of mine, but I'd never get them at full price ($2.00 off between 5am to 10am).   Just be aware that shortstop isn't as cheap as it might seem.  I recall paying almost $20 for a large bbq sandwich, which was tasty but at that price a full pizza would have made more sense.
It's a great place for a midnight snack run.  Their menu was relatively basic with some vegan options.  They have 2 freezers full of ice cream truck style ice cream.  The service was quick and friendly.  No tables to sit down and eat.  I had the poor man's pizza and loved it!
cat sandwich munchies for the late night!
Exactly what two stars means: "meh. I've experienced better". Really not great. Lacked flavor, very average. Bread was above average, meat lacked seasoning on the roast beef. Very slow service, and below average on the friendly scale. Imagine wawa or quick check with a sense of entitlement. This review comes from an out of owner with no agenda.
c'mon it's short stop.  they make sandwiches that are larger than your arm and have not closed their doors for 22 years...  if you're looking for a refined experience go somewhere else.  if it's 3 am and you need a turkey reuben that will make you loosen your belt at least one notch, go to short stop.  it's 24/7/365.
Open 24 hours. Service is good, and quick as well. The ordering system is quick and efficient and the drinks are really cheap with a sandwich. The real reason for the 5 stars is the ice cream in the summer. Best soft serve in Ithaca with a nice place to sit outside and enjoy.
