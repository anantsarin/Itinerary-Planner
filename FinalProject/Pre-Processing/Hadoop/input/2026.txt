One word: YUM! I have been here twice and I am in love. One of my friends who lives in Tonawanda thought I would enjoy Smoke on The Water, so we went there for dinner and drinks on the patio. Let me start off by saying that the food smelled down right delicious. My mouth was watering while we ordered a drink from the bar. (There was a short wait for a table outside.)  One of the bartenders made a special spicy jalapeno margarita. It was the perfect combination of sweet and spicy. I would be lying if I said that I did not get buzzed off of one. If you are looking to get knocked on your butt, I would order this margarita. Let's get down to brass tax, everyone is reading this review to find out about the quality and taste of the food. I am mildly obsessed with the pulled pork dinner. Both times I have visited SOTW, I have ordered the pulled pork with the mac and cheese, and sweet potato fries. Holy pork, there was a lot of food! I always have leftovers and they heat up very well. The pork is tender and beautifully seasoned, I tend to slather nearly a full bottle of their BBQ sauce on it because it is so delicious! The mac and cheese is served with BBQ sauce and goldfish crackers. I know what you're thinking....but it's good! They really know what they are doing in the kitchen over there! My only complaint is that the chairs outside are kind of flimsy and it was too hot to even consider sitting inside. I would love to see SOTW expand and provide customers with more comfortable seating arrangements. This does not deter me from coming here but I know that it could improve. I absolutely love this restaurant and I suggest it for a date night, or a small group of friends looking for the best BBQ around!

This tiny place is shoehorned into a corner by the water and bridge in the City of a Tonawanda. Best to sit outside if the weather permits. Our server was sweet and friendly and good. The prices fair. Here is a summary: Sauce: Kansas City style, nothing special Chicken: smoky and excellent Brisket- tender and juicy but where was the smoke flavor? Indicative of oven baked brisket with a little grilling before being served. Pulled pork - big portion, flavorful but lacked smokey flavor similar to the brisket. Fries: seasoned and excellent Cornbread - the best, buttery and perfect Pecan pie: warmed with ice cream, excellent

After moving to Buffalo from the South, I was a little afraid of not being able to find good Bar-B-Que.  But, then I found Smoke on the Water.  This is one of my favorite places to eat. Ever. In the world.  I love that it's small, you can see the guys cooking in the kitchen, there's a well-stocked bar, you can let loose and have a good time, there's a patio over the river for the summer....the list of great things goes on and on.  And we haven't even gotten to the food yet. I've had their ribs, their pulled pork, and the fish tacos (I think that was a special one evening).  They always have not only delicious sounding specials, but also really imaginative and creative dishes to offer.  For example:  How can you make homemade mac and cheese even better?  Throw some cheddar Gold Fish crackers on there!  OR how about their Beans & Greens - (baked beans, collard greens, and mandarin oranges...shut your mouth!)   While their specials always sound good, I end up getting the rack of ribs dinner every damn time.  The meat is smoked to perfection and falls off the bone, and the sauce is so good your tongue will want to slap your brains out.  Serve that up with some beans & greens, their fresh veggie of the day, and a piece of honey cornbread and I'm in heaven. Quit reading this review and just go to Smoke on the Water...now!

Pulled pork sandwich and fries were awesome. Sat at the bar. Great service and great food. What more do you need. Docked our boat at Gateway Park and walked over. If you are transiting the Erie Canal, stop in for some bbq. Can't go wrong.

Smoke on the Water is awesome.  I had the two meat platter with brisket and turkey.  Both were great. The turkey was amazing.  Nice selection of beers and sides, too.  Bonus for non-meat eaters:  more than a few fish options to choose from.

Very good! Nice atmosphere, yummy food and good service. Definitely going back! On the smaller side but all great choices
Good food portion for the money...the full rack of ribs was big but dry. The sides are good we had mac cheese and tatas. Group of 7 was $105 after tax with some leftovers too.

We've been wanting to stop here and try it out for awhile; our friends Kevin & Gail rave about it. It was great; we tried the fried green tomatoes as an appetizer. Then we tried the crab cake and pork tacos. Everything was amazing. Loved it & can't wait to go back!

This was some of the best barbecue I've had in a while! Between the three of us we had baby back ribs, chicken, and the special of the day, a sandwich. The barbecue has the exact right amount of kick and great flavor. Cornbread is a must- nice and sweet, plus fluffy! We will definitely return.

We brought an out-of-town friend here for dinner on a Thursday evening and were excited to try due to the relationship with Torches. They asked us for ID for our cocktails. We are all over 30 and, flattered, handed the waitress our state-issued photo IDs. THEY REFUSED TO SERVE OUR FRIEND BECAUSE SHE HAS AN ILLINOIS LICENSE. When we questioned the waitress, this was confirmed by the shift manager. I was not content to let this go. It is a state-issued photo ID. While I'm flattered we were carded, it's not as though we are spring chickens on the cusp of legal drinking age where there is a significant question of age. We insisted and-- only after we provided the manager with our friend's work website with picture, with her state-issued ID (Illinois), and her work ID, and a website with college information --was she allowed to purchase a drink. All this for one drink? To accompany their mediocre barbeque for an over-30 group on a Thursday night? More than a little ridiculous.Not really worth the time or the money. Not sure why we even stayed as the food ended up being run-of-the-mill and nothing like the tremendous experiences we've had at Torches. Won't be back here or to Torches ever again... with or without our out-of-town guests.

The food is excellent, I would have gave 5 stars but I think the bar prices are not  respective to the food prices therefor 4 it is.  Definitely recommended!

After hearing so many great things about this restaurant, so we were looking forward to trying this restaurant.  It was cloudy, and folk were smoking on the deck, so opted to sit indoors.  The staff were friendly, and we were seated within minutes of arriving.  Unfortunately, it's sad when the best thing about the experience was the Jalapeno Bad Ass Margarita - which was excellent.  I ordered the pulled pork dinner, and my husband ordered the Fish Outa Watah with a side of their Nickel City Mac & Cheese.  My pulled pork had no real smoke flavor to it.  It also had a lot of fat in it, and wasn't heated that well.  For sides I had the baked beans & sweet potato fries.  The beans were cloyingly sweet & tasted as though they had doctored canned baked beans.  The sweet potato fries looked as though the had been previously frozen & then fried  It was a big disappointment.  My husband's reaction to his order was "Meh".  I'm glad we tried it, but this definitely not a restaurant I would recommend to my friends.  I

I enjoyed having dinner on the patio overlooking the water. Service was quick and attentive. We started with the hand grenade. ..delicious.  for "supper" I had choose your own adventure pick 3. Brisquit was a bit dry but tasty. Ribs and pulled pork were perfect. The corn bread comes covered in butter (genius ) voodoo fries rocked and coleslaw was different but it worked for me. I would definitely go back. Dying to try the pork belly tacos. You get your $$ worth for sure. I couldn't finish 2 of the 3 meats.

Holy homemade pretzel sticks!!! Not to mention the fresh dipping sides... This restaurant has been on my list of places to check out. Especially, because it is the same owners as one of Buffalo's best fine dining experiences (Torches). Everything on this menu stands out because they use contemporary ingredients, but in that old BBQ style that is always a crowd pleaser.   The quality of the food paired with the incredibly reasonable prices makes this place a home run! And, the overall feel of this casual and cool BBQ joint makes it easy to see that SOTW will be sticking around for a LONG LONG time (now, you'll have no excuse not to try every item on the menu!). Happy to see this kind of deliciousness vamping up Tonawanda!
What can I say that people haven't said about SOTW. I was first introduced to this place but my co worker that wanted to mix it up and take a break from our usual Chipotle lunch time meal. Its about a 10 minute drive from work which isn't too bad. But considering we only have about an hour lunch. thats about 20minutes of just driving which is not good. What we did was actually call ahead in advance that we have a group of three coming in for lunch and would like to eat there. So by the time we sit, the food would just come right out, chow down and leave within the hour. The place is located right before a bridge that goes into North Tonawanda. I forgot our servers name but we sat at the bar and had excellent service from her. She was very nice and friendly and made sure we were taken care of. Our water was always full and my soda was always refilled. My order was the pulled pork sandwich and I substitute the regular fries for Sweet Potato Waffle Fries which was a small charge for the upgrade. The regular fries that come with it taste relish because I was able to taste it from my co worker who got it. When our food came out, it looked amazing. There was bbq sauce on the table and boy I love my BBQ sauce. there was a nice amount in there already but I added more to it. The pork was nice and moist and very yummy & relish. The next time I come back though, i will just get the regular order fries because even that, those fries were very very tasty. The pricing for lunch was very very reasonable for the amount of food we got. I will for sure be back with my co-workers when we want to break that Chipotle lunch routine we go.

Visited SOTW my first night visiting a friend while in the area.  The location itself was typical enough for a mom and pop BBQ place, interior was pretty relaxed, waitress was friendly, and the atmosphere was very laid back. Ordered the Pulled Pork Dinner with a double helping of Sweet Potato Waffle Fries. Food was spot on, pork was delicious and succulent, while the waffle fries were perfectly fried avoiding the normal issue of sweet potato fries either being cooked to a crisp or underdone. Food came out fast, was wonderful quality, and reasonably priced. I may hit them up again before I head back out.

Don't be dissuaded by the few low-star reviews. My decision to come here wavered a bit since I wasn't sure I'd enjoy it, but this place is great! So glad I tried SOTW! Stopped in this afternoon after raiding the Farmer's Market. We got a table on the patio. It was sunny out, though not too warm, but it was so nice sitting out in the fresh air. I ordered the pork belly tacos (on the appetizer menu). Mom got pulled pork sandwich. Brother got the Cubano. We ordered a side of mac & cheese to share. I loved the pork belly tacos! They were VERY tasty. Not a huge portion- only 2, but after eating those and working on the mac & cheese, I was full. I tried the Cubano- YUM! And the pulled pork- YUM YUM YUM! The pork was moist and toothsome. Very enjoyable! Plus, those voodoo fries are TASTY! And I'm not a huge fan of fries. The thing that set my stars at 5 vs 4 was our super friendly, happy waitress, Kari! She was attentive and chatty, helpful too, without being overbearing at all. We really appreciated Kari's service and great attitude. She was a breath of fresh air! It was so nice to sit out on the water in the sun, enjoy a tasty BBQ lunch, with excellent service. And I love that their smoker is hydro-powered. So cool!!! We will most certainly be back! I've gotta try their ribs!

Excellent bbq (ribs are never exactly the same, but always good) and the beans are a must. Who knew collard greens and mandarin oranges would make amazing baked beans? The owners are great too, and they have creative & awesome specials every week. When it's nice out, the deck is open, overlooking the river... It's awesome. My favorite restaurant in the Buffalo area, hands down, and the gem of the NT. We've done birthday parties there, casual lunch, date night dinner, even take out-- you can't go wrong at Smoke.
I've been wanting to try this place since it's opening and I was not disappointed. The place has that very casual "hole in the wall/ southern BBQ" theme going on inside- I dug it. We ordered the "hand grenade potato," which is a baked potato loaded with cheese, pulled pork, sour cream, and jalopeno peppers. It was pretty good albeit it is probably 2,000 calories. My girlfriend and I split a "3 Meat Adventure" which came with 3 sides for $25. We chose pulled pork, chicken, and baby back ribs for our meats, and cheesy tater tots, mac and cheese and Chivettas potatoes for our sides. Everything was fantastic. The ribs and chicken were phenomenal. The cheesy tater tots and mac and cheese were also very good. Despite growing up in Buffalo, I have never been a fan of Chivettas dressing, so I didn't give the potatoes a fair shot (my girlfriend was a fan.) Our waitress was very helpful and polite, and our food came out very fast. I really don't have any qualms with the place, and I'm excited to check out their patio in the summer, which is overlooking the canal. A nice change of pace in terms of Buffalo BBQ.

The man who created this menu is evil.  He entices you to the table with promises of great things (are there REALLY goldfish crackers on the blue cheese mac 'n cheese??) and leaves you in anticipation (chiavetta soaked baby white potatoes - this HAS to be amazing! ) only to let you down again and again.  Maybe the regular chef is wintering in Florida and his stand-in is struggling to fill the shoes of greatness.  Maybe the ambiance of the water on a summertime evening makes the food taste better or helps you to overlook all of the shortcomings. The food under-delivers what the menu promises.  The blue cheese base of the mac 'n cheese had almost no flavor.  The BBQ sauce (only one kind offered) was a little too sweet even for me.  My dinner partner ate his pulled pork and smoked turkey without sauce, that's how sweet it was. If you are somehow forced to eat here, or just want to experience this disaster first hand because you don't believe me, don't order the ribs - listen to the other reviews.  They were a little tough, certainly didn't fall off the bone AT ALL (knife and fork needed to get the meat off - that's just WRONG) and were dry. It's not possible that so many (reliable) Yelpers were so very wrong about the food here.  Although, the 4th(!!) place BBQ pork trophy might indicate instead that more of my fellow Yelpers need to take a trip to Blasdell and try BW's Barbeque on Lake Avenue.  I'm pretty sure they won first place in any BBQ contest they entered, but you won't see any trophies pathetically on display, only awesome food and customers who are happy and well fed. BW's Barbeque was also about 1/2 the price and gave twice as much food (with 4 types of sauce to choose from), but there's no canal.

I really wanted to like this place.  I have given it 3 chances.  I love BBQ.  This is not a BBQ restaurant. If you are going here expecting a true blue BBQ restaurant you will be disappointed. When you compare what this is to what in my mind is BBQ you will be left wondering what you paid for. So I recommend to anyone going here to realize what this place really is.  It is a great breath of life to the Tonawandas.  It is a nice restaurant with a menu that is BBQ inspired.  That said, few things on this menu can be considered real BBQ.  Those that are "real" BBQ left me kind of disappointed.  I have had just about everything on the menu by now in a futile attempt to find something I can really say I enjoyed. The only place locally that has been able to cook a brisket was Wil's and he has closed. The ribs, pork and most sadly the brisket have been a disappointment. The brisket I had recently was smokeless, over cooked and sauced.  Come on.  All sins of a bad brisket.  It was sliced thick to hide the fact that it was over cooked. Even sliced thick it would fall apart. :(  It seriously tasted like pot roast.  That is the fucking worst. Some of the sides are interesting but as Carley M. has stated when you get them they are less than impressive.  It's really sad because this place could be something interesting.  The bar isn't horrible. I don't think that BBQ is their forte.  It is not human nature to get worse at something the longer you do it which is why I have gone in 3 different times over the course of their tenure.  Each time is like the first.  That tells me there is a lack of experience and knowledge of what to do.   Also, get rid of the buckets of sweet baby rays....... seriously? I apologize for the harsh critique but it is what it is.  Hopefully they use this info to improve their operation.

Even sliced thick it would fall apart. :(  It seriously tasted like pot roast.  That is the fucking worst. Some of the sides are interesting but as Carley M. has stated when you get them they are less than impressive.  It's really sad because this place could be something interesting.  The bar isn't horrible. I don't think that BBQ is their forte.  It is not human nature to get worse at something the longer you do it which is why I have gone in 3 different times over the course of their tenure.  Each time is like the first.  That tells me there is a lack of experience and knowledge of what to do.   Also, get rid of the buckets of sweet baby rays....... seriously? I apologize for the harsh critique but it is what it is.  Hopefully they use this info to improve their operation.
I loved everything I tried there!! The blackened grouper had a nice spice (to me) and shrimp k-bobs were so good with some kind of sweetness to them!! All the sides I had were, again, very good!! I definitely recommend this place! Yuuuummmm!!

I came here and was uber hungry.  Ordered the family plate, which was a real menagerie of every kind of deliciously killed, barbequed, and smoked meat that you could imagine.  There was pulled pork, ribs, chicken, and turkey.  Each had a delicious smoky flavor, but some were definitely better than others (the pulled pork was boring in my opinion).   The caprese salad with its smoked mozarella and ripe red tomatoes in early May, and the wedge salad with chips, bacon and a delightfully creamy blue cheese dressing drizzled all over it, were surprisingly good.  Surprising like when you go up to the convenience store to buy a package of gum and realize that the gum is on sale as a 2-for-1 deal. The fries were fantastic (and I don't usually say that about fries).  The corn bread tasted like it was made by God himself (or herself who's judging?).  Up until this point in the meal I felt like something special was happening.  I felt like I was about to win the super bowl.  But then I realized that this was not going to be the super bowl, rather much closer to the Buffalo Bills, the end of the meal was a wide right shot because the pecan pie came out of the kitchen and was a total let down.  The pie was flavorless, buttery, and not all together pleasing to eat. I recovered from the pie and will live to fight another day of artery clogging goodness. P.S. They have rotating local beer taps including southern tier, which is a big plus.  Also the corn bread is out of this world good.

Smoke on the water is a tasty barbecue joint right on the edge of Tonawanda and North Tonawanda. I wish I lived closer to it because it would probably be a part of my regular rotation. The place is small, so if you go in the winter expect it to be full, but when the weather warms they increase in size thanks to an outdoor patio right on the canal. The food. Good stuff. I went with a group of 8 and everyone loved their meals. I'd have to say the best thing I tasted was the bit of hog wings I sampled from a friend's order. Next time, that's what I'm getting. I ordered the ribs, which were fine. Not the best ribs I've ever had, but I'm picky when it comes to ribs.  The kitchen sent us a complimentary order of Hand Grenades as a starter and in return we bought the kitchen a "round of drinks" (actually an option on the menu.) Back to these Hand Grenades -- they are little baked potatoes stuffed with pulled pork and then covered with cheddar, jalapeño peppers and sour cream. I mean, how can you go wrong with that? They were great. The only thing I didn't like was the mac and cheese (topped with goldfish crackers.)  The presentation is cute but the actual mac and cheese did nothing for me. Overall, I would say that Smoke on the Water is worth a visit if you're in the area. I'll be going again if I'm ever up that way.

I went to Smoke on the Water yesterday with co-workers and let me start off by saying this place is pretty cool. We started off by getting the VIP tour by the Richert brothers and they showed us the smokers and how they work and their system of wetting the wood and its pretty amazing. Because it was Canal Fest we were only limited to the special menu, but that didn't stop them from sending out some of the off menu appetizers. We started off with the "pulled pork hand grenade" which consisted of a baked potato stuffed with their pulled pork, jalapeños and cheese! This was as fergie would say: D to the E to the L-I-C-I-O-U-S! We also got one of their smoked sausages wrapped in a pastry topped with a spicy mustard which was also a big hit with the table! So far so good... For the meal selection they only had a select number of sandwiches that came with chips and ribs which came in portions of full, half, and quarter along with your choice of a side. I got the ribs and they were pretty good... not great. I was expecting the meat to just fall off the bone without any effort, but they were a little tough for my liking, but the BBQ sauce was great. On the table they gave you two types of BBQ sauce one being a Kansas City style and I really couldn't tell you what the other was. Overall the meal was good and I would totally go there again! The outside patio seating was fun and the weather was great! The only downside to the outdoor seating was the chairs. They were uncomfortable and awkward to sit in. It was a great atmosphere and the service was amazing. I recommend you go and try it!

Funky vibe, great BBQ. Perfect place for a summer weekend lunch. Smoked hamburger was great, same for pork sandwich. Next time trying the salad.
The 2hr wait from walking in until food came was disappointing. I ordered a PBR draft. It was the smallest draft beer I've ever gotten for three fifty. (About a 12oz mason jar glass) The pulled pork was very tasty, though. All in all, it's worth a try but probably not going back anytime soon. Just too slow.

I really don't know why people love this place so much!  I mean, it's cute and the location on the water is nice.  Even the name is catchy.  The problem is that the food just DOESN'T taste good.  Not one bit of it! Three of us went here for dinner this past Friday night and we were all pretty excited because we had heard such wonderful things.  We left disappointed and with indigestion.  Note to self:  If you go into a restaurant and see a huge bottle of antacids on a shelf in the bathroom, run away BEFORE eating anything. My son and I decided to start with a shared bowl of French onion soup... one of our favorites.  This one looked good with lots of gooey cheese baked over the top.  We liked the marble rye croutons in it, but found the broth to be watery and weak.  It had none of that hearty goodness that we've come to expect.  TOTALLY BLAH! For an entree my son and I shared a "Two Meat and Two Side Supper" and our friend had half a rack of ribs.  For sides we sampled corn bread, Chiavetta's grilled potatoes, ta-tas (Tater Tots, Frank's Red Hot & nacho cheese), and Nickel City mac & cheese topped with Goldfish crackers.  Now they SOUND great, don't they?  But they weren't.  Not a one of 'em.  The corn bread was so-so, but slathered with so much butter and honey that the cornbread taste barely came though..... the potatoes were an overly vinegary mess..... the ta-tas were mushy and drowning in canned cheese sauce..... and the mac & cheese tasted so BLAND one might have thought that the cheese was actually forgotten. Mac & white sauce..... maybe.  The meats on our platter (chicken and smoked turkey) were barely edible.  The chicken was little more than skin and bones..... and the turkey was a far cry from SMOKED turkey.  It was really thick slices of deli turkey thrown on a grill and doused with barbecue sauce. Yuck! I can't judge the ribs because I don't eat that kind of thing.  They did look pretty fatty though. After we DIDN'T FINISH our meals we decided to sample some desserts. We got three for the table and decided to share..... deep fried ice cream, key lime pie, and fried bananas with caramel sauce.  I don't know why we thought the desserts would be good since the food was SO BAD, but I guess we're a bunch of optimists.  Honestly they were just as TERRIBLE!!  The deep fried ice cream was the best of the bunch... and that's only because once the corn flake coating was peeled off you were left with a good sized ball of vanilla ice cream... and how can you ruin that?  The key lime pie was DISGUSTING with so much lime zest to make it actually crunchy, broken custard, and fake whipped topping (yuck!) plopped on top.  And the bananas were (gasp!) the worst of the worst with a batter that tasted like it could have once encased a piece of deep fried haddock, bananas so overly ripe and mushy they would have been better suited to be mixed into a banana bread, and caramel topping straight from a jar. I don't know if the people who reviewed this place prior to me enjoyed a few too many cocktails before trying their meal or were so taken by the waterfront setting as to cause their taste buds to stop working.  Or maybe there is a new second (or tenth) rated chef. And to think that this place is owned by the same guys who own my beloved "Torches" is just absurd!  My advice:  STAY AWAY!

the sexy beast and i made Smoke on the Water our destination for a late lunch this past holiday weekend while we were running amok as two insanely in love kids do, and we were wholly disappointed by the experience from beginning to end.  i had read all the glowing reviews here by fellow yelpers, and i'm honestly flummoxed as to how i am in the minority in my opinion here... i'll keep it brief, but before i begin, here is my disclosure:  the Man and i KNOW barbecue.  we don't just have a preference on style or flavor, but we have a solid knowledge and appreciation for the skill and dedication that smoking good barbecue requires.  we know what we're looking for, because we smoke our own meats and craft our own sauces from scratch.  none of the standard hallmarks of good barbecue could be identified by either of us this afternoon at SOTW.  what we were served up was instead poorly prepared, blatantly REHEATED pulled pork that was sopping with grease and lacking in any sort of flavor. the location is fine.  park where you can, be prepared to walk, its not far.  the space is wisely chosen and appointed, especially for its locale on the river -- think 'hip' blue collar (you know, because they have blues music piped in everywhere).   we opted to sit on the patio at a rickety table with very uncomfortable plastic folding banquet chairs.  not a big deal, we've sat and enjoyed meals in worse conditions.  server was friendly, and no nonsense.  we ordered a couple of cocktails from the bar (peach mojito for him, a mixed berry cocktail for me).  at $8.oo each, these libations were anything but -- not a single drop of alcohol was discernible, no buzz was to be had.  a colossal waste of $16.oo, i would have asked for my tip back if i were seated at the bar.  my advice: stick to something bottled and unmanipulated by the bar staff. our food arrived quickly -- which pleased us greatly, but in retrospect, should have been a huge red flag.  portions here are on par with most restaurants (though Suzy Q's pulled pork sandwich is twice the size of a SOTW sandwich, and has three times the flavor and deliciousness). *PULLED PORK SANDWICH:  before we add sauce, we always try the pork naked, to see if it was prepared well.  the pork here is indeed pulled, and its tender, but it is FLAVORLESS and tastes like grease.  in fact, the grease will eventually sop through the roll bottom and run down your fingers.  this is the sign of reheated pork, folks.  there was no evidence of a brine, no rosy pink smoke ring at the meat's edge, no flavor from a rub, no bark.  their sauce?  absolutely unremarkable and flat, tastes like it came from a bottle (Sweet Baby Ray's anyone??).  its awesome that they have that hydro powered smoker out front, but it should have been a head's up to us when we arrived that we didn't smell any delicious barbecue on that baby.  if their meats were fresh smoked, that thing should be going all day long, especially on a busy holiday weekend. *VOODOO FRIES:  the voodoo fries (no substitutions, by the way), were blatantly frozen fare tossed in anything that would mask that fact.  in this case, tastes like some Old Bay seasoning with a little cajun spice.  they're utterly forgettable. *MAC & CHEESE:  we also tried the $4 mac and cheese topped with a bunch of flotsam like gold fish crackers, scallions and BBQ sauce (?huh?).  we decided all that crap on top is to try to make you forget the mark up you just paid for the smallest, blandest cup of reheated mac and cheese you're probably ever going to taste (when are these places going to learn you need to SALT your mac and cheese, and pick a sharper blend of cheese so the dish doesn't taste like boiled nothing sliding down your gullet?) bill total: $45.00 including tip our overall impression of SOTW is that its a fabulous addition to the wasteland of restaurants currently operating in Tonawanda (really, considering the competition in this area, its no surprise that the locals would clamor for the food here).  the Man also thinks that their accessibility to the water's edge contributes to the perceived success, since most boaters are either drunk and/or stoned and wouldn't really mind the poor quality of fare here anyway.  however, if you're someone who knows good BBQ, or who just likes food that is prepared fresh and with some integrity for the money you fork over, then DON'T go out of your way to visit SOTW.  there's more than one good, authentic BBQ joint in B-lo for you to enjoy...go there instead.

First still upon arriving in buffalo based on yelp reviews.  Not disappointed. From the South and lived in Memphis for a while ago know bbq.  This was good bbq. Dry rub voo doo was great. Shrimp was great, all better than expected. Sat out on back deck by water. Nice area. Nice people.  Good value too

Had the pleasure of visiting here on a surprisingly busy Tuesday night with my wife and family.  I was very pleased that the helpful staff was able and willing to reserve a table for seven on the outdoor patio. We parked around the corner from the restaurant due to its very limited parking.  This seems to be a point of contention for a lot of reviewers, but I think it is important to point out that virtually every quality restaurant in Buffalo lacks parking.  For crying out loud, park on one of the countless nearby residential streets .  Believe me, most of you can use the exercise. Our meals started with the Pigs in the Blanket.  I was expecting a a basket full of hot dogs wrapped in pastry.  Instead, this appetizer consists of a massive link of Andouille sausage wrapped in a tasty puff pastry that was filled with sauerkraut and topped with a mustard-based sauce.  Absolutely fantastic. Most of the table ordered ribs and no one was disappointed.  The half-rack was pretty massive and had a good char, without sacrificing the moistness of the meat.  The ribs are not soaking in BBQ sauce, which gives you the opportunity to add as much as you want from the dispenser on the table.  The "Kansas City"-labeled sauce expertly mixed sweetness with just a touch of spice.  I used it liberally. Our server was friendly and attentive.  Before the meal, she provided everyone with an amuse bouche consisting of a homemade biscuit with a strawberry preserve.  It was a nice touch. The side dishes are good, but not great.  The "Voodoo" fries are standard with a dusting of spices.  The Nickel City Mac and Cheese was good, but it made you yearn for the superior version served at Torches.  The Ta-Tas were simply tater tots covered in hot sauce and melted cheese. At this time, SOTW has a rather limited beer menu and could probably use a few more selections. Their mixed drinks are pricy but well-made. As far as BBQ restaurants are concerned, this is probably amongst the more expensive.  A couple of meals and two pitchers of Labatt Blue set me back around $55 before tax and tip. However, I do not consider the prices that much different from their competitors, and is more than made up for by the quality of the food and the experience.  I recommend visiting while the weather still permits eating on the patio, especially since the restaurant is quite small.

Great food! Only issue is the seating.... Very limited. A good idea would be to go for lunch if you can, there's plenty of seating then :)

Parking is a problem but that dead horse has been beaten on these reviews, just park across the street in the CVS lot, no worries. Great BBQ place with great food. Beer selection isn't what you see on the taps they have up for decoration which is a funny teaser to me :) If you like pulled pork, and good BBQ ribs and all that jazz try this place out. There is limited seating so you may have to wait. The back patio seating looks fun to sit at even though I didn't get a chance to when I was there, but it overlooks the water.

I've been wanting to try this place out since they opened, and finally made it here with my family on a sunny Sunday afternoon.  It sits right along the canal on Young and Main st.   They have a deck in the back to sit back, relax, and enjoy the canal.  Only drawback with the location is parking, only about 6 spaces in tiny parking lot, so most likely you would have to use the Walgreen's parking lot across the street.   Inside is not really big either, but they make up for that in character and vibe.  It's a pretty cool looking bar, and there's an order up window you can look at to watch the cooks pass their orders.  Even though it was a nice day outside, it was also very windy so we opted to sit just inside near the sliding glass door.   For starters, we went with the caprese salad.  And as a bonus, the chef sent out a free appetizer of the hubcap nachos as well....yes served on an actual car hubcap....sweet!   The caprese salad was pretty good, and drizzled with a balsamic and EVO.  The nachos were different than the standard nachos you might think.  The cheese tasted like a combo of shredded cheddar and cream cheese.  It was topped with jalapeño peppers, chopped lettuce and tomato, shredded chicken, and a taco seasoning....different but extremely good!   For my meal I went with the pulled pork dinner.  It comes with a choice of 2 sides, and I went with the Ta Tas (Tatar tots splashed with franks hot sauce and completely covered in a thick nacho cheese) and baked beans with escarole and slices of Mandarin oranges.   The pulled pork was a good size half pound portion cooked perfectly, and just drizzled with a little BBQ sauce, and I added more as I ate....delicious!   The sides were outstanding!  I also sampled the Chiavetta's Grilled Potatoes my mother was raving about, I think I might get this side next time.  The beans with Mandarin oranges were probably the best beans I've ever had. And then there are Ta Tas, simple and sinfully good.....I think anything covered in gooey nacho cheese is...right?  And I don't think I'll ever look at a Tatar tot the same way after this awesome experience.   The food came out fast and the service was super friendly.   I'll definitely be back!

Smoke on the Water is certainly a unique establishment. It was helpful to know ahead of time that you were free to park at Walgreen's across the street, for it was a busy Friday night in the area this summer evening and nearby, short-term parking was a luxury, especially with the threatening skies. We were greeted promptly and with a welcome, despite the large crowd. We had no preference regarding patio or indoor seating, since the threat of rain was real. The place was hopping.  There was a mini dessert stand, with an apple pie you got to stare at while awaiting a table. We were seated near the kitchen sign at a cozy two-topper. Music was playing, the crowd was a mix of ages, and there was an upbeat feel to the atmosphere. From a family with two children to single-mingles, it was apropos to a locally-owned joint. Our server greeted us with that nails-on-a-chalkboard phrase, "how are WE tonight?"  when she clearly was asking how are you tonight. I secretly predicted, with 100% accuracy, that she would also ask, upon our paying the bill, as she swooped up the check presenter (the little black folder), the second cringe-worthy phrase I loathe,  "can I bring you some change?" Servers tend to ask this without ever seeing what's inside, for crying out loud. Two disposable phrases. The correct phrase is, "I'll return with this in a minute" or something like that. Having never been to SOTW, we reviewed the menu after our server rattled off the specials. She wasn't terribly helpful about suggestions, but certainly gave us time to mull over the offerings. We asked about the sangria, it sounded summery, then just ordered one red to try. It was awful. Simply. Awful. $8. And served in a faux stemless wine glass. It was plastic. Made me take a sniff of the fruit, single slices along the rim, I mean, shoot! was IT real? I do hope the "glass"  wasn't disposable, what a lot of waste that would generate! Two thumbs down on the drink. The guy lugging BBQ from the smoker was a real work horse, politely weaving his way through the crowd with big aluminum foil pans of grub. We decided to order "Choose Your Own Adventure" and share it, where you may order any two meats and two sides for $19. Pulled pork and 1/4 baby back BBQ ribs with French Fried Potatoes with Creole Voodoo Powder and cornbread (the server said that was popular). The best part of the meal was the ribs, very, very good. I inquired about the seasoning on the french fries and with a smile, was told it was Creole Voodoo Powder. Upon pushing for a more specific answer, I was informed, "it's just a bunch of seasonings". Well, there you go. Didn't care for it, too heavily salted and flavored with that "bunch of seasonings" and the cornbread, well, being in Texas for a number of years and knowing the real thing, this was more of a corn dessert, or cake. It was different, not bad at all, but certainly not corn BREAD, which is ordinarily full of texture (corn meal) and definitely NOT sweet. The rain came down and the patio-dwellers funneled in, in single file, dads with baby buckets, moms with drinks and half-eaten bowls of baby food mush with the sound of many flip flops scuffing past. And lots of smiles. Smoke on the Water was surely a happy place. It was crowded, probably filled with regulars who dig the place and the music, with their friends all gathered in a friendly place. For me, it was just a meh! kind of place. HoneyPie liked the food much more than I, hence 3 stars, not two, not four.

Seriously, the ribs are excellent. Our waitress Samantha was professional, prompt and simply amazing. I can only really speak on the ribs and chicken and that may be the case for some time. Because the next time that I go here I will most likely get the same things.

This was our second visit to SOTW and I have to say it was just as good as the first visit. Had to wait for a table so we had a seat at the bar. Bartender suggested a great Cabernet, already enjoying my visit. Hostess came over to let us know our table was ready in approximately 15 minutes. Our server Keegan was very friendly and helpful and the food was Fantastic!  I had the Grouper dinner with those wonderful sweet potato(waffle shaped) fries with the honey butter, that is to die for and baked beans with collard greens( which in my opinion should have had more of the greens in it) but tasty. My guest had the Portabella sandwich, it was tasty but sloppy because they used 2 mushrooms in it instead of 1-large mushroom. Voodoo Fries good but a bit too salty in my opinion.

I've been nagging my hb to take me here for awhile now and I am happy to say that it has paid off! Super delicious BBQ and Laguanita's Undercover Investigation Shutdown Ale with friendly service?  We will definitely be back! Love the voodoo fries!

Love it here - delicious BBQ.  Gotta get the hand grenade appetizer - a loaded stuffed potato with pork, jalapenos, sour cream and cheese.  Great drinks.  Service was great.   You can see them making the meat on the smoker by the water. Awesome patio right on the canal.  It is a small place, so on a nice day - expect a wait.  But it is worth the wait!  They cater too - I was at a fundraiser with their food and it was a hit!

Fantastic pulled pork, the sweet potato fries with honey butter is to die for. The food, the service, the location is all wonderful. When the weather is nice, sitting outside gives a nice view of the river. Parking lot I believe is getting expanded which will be wonderful, but otherwise the walk isn't bad.

Stopped in Saturday around 1:15 while on a ride along the river.   There was no shaded tables left on the deck, so I sat inside even though there was no AC but they did have fans on.  I was promptly greeted by the bartender and ordered a drink.  We ordered the deviled eggs, and the brisket sandwich.  The deviled eggs were well spiced and topped with pulled pork, green onion and BBQ sauce.  The BBQ sauce was very sweet but had enough complexity to be good.  The eggs were fantastic. The brisket sandwich arrived topped with cole slaw and accompanied seasoned  fries.  The fries had some heat and were good.  Unfortunately the brisket was served way too soon.  It was tough and had no smoke ring yet.  If it would have been left in another hour or two it would have been excellent.  I would be willing to try it again though.  Also next on the list is the tacos.  Overall, this visit was just OK, the eggs saved the day, but with their moderate plus prices, the brisket was a disappointment.

My family of 3 (husband, wife & 5 year old son) ate at Smoke on the Water this past Sunday and really liked it!  The parking was weird - we were confused about whether it was okay to park in the small lot next to the restaurant.  There was a sign that said "motorcycle parking only" but it wasn't attached to anything - it was just leaning against the wall.  We parked there anyway (it was mid-afternoon on a Sunday and not busy) and after going inside we saw the sign about parking across the intersection at Walgreens.  I asked my husband if I should move the car and he said just leave it. We were a little surprised at how small the dining room is - fewer than 10 tables and then the bar.  There was patio seating but it was definitely too cold to sit outside, plus VERY smoky from the smoker. We paid $22 + tax/tip for the "Choose your Adventure" with pulled pork, 1/4 chicken (my husband and son are not big on pork), voodoo fries, and Nickel City Mac & Cheese.   The pulled pork was VERY good.  It was very well separated without being chopped up, and moist without being greasy or fatty at all.  It had a good amount of BBQ sauce without being too saucy (there is sauce on the table if you want to add more) and I really enjoyed it. My husband said the chicken was "fine."  He said once you get past the outside with the sauce and everything, chicken is chicken.  He and our son both liked it. The mac & cheese was really good - interesting, different than any mac & cheese I'd ever tasted (I am NOT a mac & cheese enthusiast).   Not sure what kind of cheese they use but it's certainly not the orange velveeta/american stuff like I think of when I picture most mac & cheese.  It had chopped scallions and goldfish crackers on top!  My son liked the crackers.  :) The voodoo fries (battered fries sprinkled with "voodoo powder" - chili/paprika/salt mixture of some kind) were delicious!  I loved them without needing to dip them in anything, and they both liked them too. Very good.  It definitely had a bit of a sports bar vibe (the Bills game was on both TVs over the bar and there was definitely some shouting during certain plays) and the dining room itself seemed a bit unfinished. I didn't love that a very small glass of pop was $3 (I'm sure my husband could have gotten a refill but the waitress never offered) and the dining room felt chilly, but the food was yummy and I'd certainly return.

I had to save something special for my 100th review, and I believe that Smoke on the Water is more than a fitting candidate.  The brothers Kevin and JJ Richert have knocked the ball out of the park in this seemingly unassuming restaurant on the canal in the City of Tonawanda.  If you have eaten at the brother's other restaurant Torches (one of my favourite restaurants in WNY) you know how ridiculously creative these guys are.  At Torches, the brothers have made it very clear that they have mastered a variety of food genres including Italian, Asian, Polish, Soul, etc.  Now with Smoke on the Water they have made it clear that BBQ is clearly their stand out genre.   First off, the name of the restaurant is not only kick a$$, with a nod to Deep Purple, but absolutely fitting and perfect.  This is definitely a shift in the right direction after the poorly named Remington Tavern Seafood Exchange (maybe I missed it, but it is neither a tavern nor a seafood exchange...discuss) and YOLO (wtf??)  recently opened in town.  Smoke is extremely hard to find, as it is tucked behind a Beverage Distributor on a busy intersection, and the parking sucks.  However, once you walk inside you are transported to another world, a cute little paradise with a full bar and seating on the beautiful canal. The first time I went was with my lovely fiancée on a Sunday morning.  For my lady friend and I, Sundays are our high holy days dedicated to working off our hangovers (mostly from Vera) at the United Church of Brunch (with Eggs Benedict and Bloody Mary's constituting the blessed sacraments).  Yet on this particular day we skipped services (a venal sin) and found ourselves indulging in fiery BBQ (the tool of the Devil in this analogy).  Well, if I am damned to hell this is exactly what I would hope to find there.  BBQ that was deftly prepared with ribs which were fall off the bone tender, pulled pork glistening with fat, and locally sourced roasted chicken with smoke imbued throughout.  I indulged in their award winning Nickle City Mac and Cheese, with bleu cheese, hot sauce and crushed goldfish, and the best (and only) waffle-cut sweet potato fries I have ever eaten, with a lightly sweet and heavily buttered dipping sauce.  JJ Richert even gave us some complimentary Jello Shots on the way out.  When I sin, I sin big!! I loved this place so much I could not wait to go back.  I brought my lady friend again this time with her 8 year old son, "the Little Prince", who was not in a good mood that evening.  The Little Prince finds it very difficult to eat at any restaurant other than Pizza Plant.  This time we sat on the canal, and his attitude totally improved when the waitress brought us a glass of ice cubes which we subsequently used to pelt the passing ducks.*   We ordered the special hog wings, which look like a miniature version of those smoked turkey legs you get at the fair, but these were glazed with an Asian sauce.  They were very good and tender.  This was followed up with pulled pork, blackened grouper and smoked turkey breast slices.  However, the real prize was the tater tots. ("Napoleon, give me some of your tots.")  The home made crunchy tots covered with faux cheese and hot sauce were amazing...I really mean that, amazing.  I've never described tots as amazing before, FYI.   I have been waiting for Dinosaur BBQ (the Rochester/Syracuse BBQ powerhouse) to get their prehistoric a$$es to town for 15 plus years now, and now that they are finally opening here, I could care less.  Smoke on the Water is that good, with a rotating selection of high-end entrees, creative appetizers and amazing BBQ.  I have been saying it for months now and this is yet another reason to exclaim: The Western New York renaissance is nigh!!  So gird your loins and go enjoy some fantastic BBQ. *No Animals were harmed in the making of this review!

I should have known better as I'm not a fan of Torches, that this place was only going to be another bad experience for me. In the art of smoking meat and BBQ, this place has a lot to learn before they'll be getting another try from me. I think the staple of all good BBQ are the ribs, and this place definitely set the bar low for me. The rib meat was bland, they were tough (more like a St. Louis style) and they were dry. The sauce was mediocre, had a very 'generic' feel to it. As one poster put here, the fries were better than the meal. All I can say is bring on Dinosaur BBQ because Buffalo needs it!

The boys from Torches have recently opened up a BBQ restaurant right off of the Niagara River on Ellicott Creek in the City of Tonawanda. The Restaurant: The smallish restaurant has been upgraded with a two level outdoor deck backing up to Ellicott Creek. The top level seats ~ 30 -40 guests and is a nice place to sit outside on the water and enjoy the summer weather. The lower level deck allows boats from the River to dock up and stop in for some grub. A great idea to draw some different customers The Food: I ordered the two meat combo for $19 which include 1/4 rack of ribs, pulled pork and two sides. The combo is maybe $4 more than most other BBQ places but I like the variety the two meat combo provides. The ribs were very moist with a nice BBQ glaze on the outside. The major issue was the fact that the ribs were missing any smoke flavor. BBQ 101 is always to look for the smoke ring around the meat and there was no pink hue what so ever. It was very disheartening. I love BBQ - I really do - though these ribs were flavorful there was NO hint of smoke. This is a cardinal BBQ sin in my book. The pulled pork was a bigger disappointment. The pork was sauced prior and it seemed to have sat in one of the metal serving trays for a long time before its arrival. The highlight of pulled pork for me is the bark. The bark was soggy from what I am guessing is stewing in sauce for a while. Again, there was no hint of smoke. The sides: I ordered the shoestring fries with some seasoning. The fries were generic frozen fries with some house rub sprinkled on top. They were fine - not good not bad. I also ordered their Mac N Cheese which is a play on the Award Winning Mac N Cheese from their flagship Torches. The noodles were over cooked; not very cheesy, no real top layer crust of goldfish. This was more of a mass batch scoop and serve that sat for a while and became worse over time. Other fun: They took a whimsical feature from the Torches menu and added brought it to Smoke on the Water - Buy the kitchen a round of drinks for $6. I heard about it from a buddy of mine who raves about Torches. He told me that he ordered it and in return received an off the menu app that was a nice fun experience. I decided to do the same. I was expecting an app but then our entrees came out. Then I thought maybe dessert? Then our check came. Then thought I am going to flip out if I gave a $6 donation. The server forgot to ring it in. Ah no big deal. To wrap it up: Spent $60 pre tip for 2 combos, 1 IPA, 1 Specialty drink, and one Soda. The food was average. I love my BBQ and because of that I am a tougher food critique then most. With or without me this place is going to succeed. It has a good location, nice outdoor space, and it is an unique offering. The business model works - the BBQ leaves something to be desired. I wanted this to be my go to spot and they let me down. I expect more from chefs running a place like Torches. Was it an off night? I'm not sure - They are having a Sunday Luau August 5th with a pig roast for $17. I'll check that out and update. Like I said, I have high BBQ standards. Go check it out for yourself - you might love it and laugh at me.
The boys from Torches have recently opened up a BBQ restaurant right off of the Niagara River on Ellicott Creek in the City of Tonawanda. The Restaurant: The smallish restaurant has been upgraded with a two level outdoor deck backing up to Ellicott Creek. The top level seats ~ 30 -40 guests and is a nice place to sit outside on the water and enjoy the summer weather. The lower level deck allows boats from the River to dock up and stop in for some grub. A great idea to draw some different customers The Food: I ordered the two meat combo for $19 which include 1/4 rack of ribs, pulled pork and two sides. The combo is maybe $4 more than most other BBQ places but I like the variety the two meat combo provides. The ribs were very moist with a nice BBQ glaze on the outside. The major issue was the fact that the ribs were missing any smoke flavor. BBQ 101 is always to look for the smoke ring around the meat and there was no pink hue what so ever. It was very disheartening. I love BBQ - I really do - though these ribs were flavorful there was NO hint of smoke. This is a cardinal BBQ sin in my book. The pulled pork was a bigger disappointment. The pork was sauced prior and it seemed to have sat in one of the metal serving trays for a long time before its arrival. The highlight of pulled pork for me is the bark. The bark was soggy from what I am guessing is stewing in sauce for a while. Again, there was no hint of smoke. The sides: I ordered the shoestring fries with some seasoning. The fries were generic frozen fries with some house rub sprinkled on top. They were fine - not good not bad. I also ordered their Mac N Cheese which is a play on the Award Winning Mac N Cheese from their flagship Torches. The noodles were over cooked; not very cheesy, no real top layer crust of goldfish. This was more of a mass batch scoop and serve that sat for a while and became worse over time. Other fun: They took a whimsical feature from the Torches menu and added brought it to Smoke on the Water - Buy the kitchen a round of drinks for $6. I heard about it from a buddy of mine who raves about Torches. He told me that he ordered it and in return received an off the menu app that was a nice fun experience. I decided to do the same. I was expecting an app but then our entrees came out. Then I thought maybe dessert? Then our check came. Then thought I am going to flip out if I gave a $6 donation. The server forgot to ring it in. Ah no big deal. To wrap it up: Spent $60 pre tip for 2 combos, 1 IPA, 1 Specialty drink, and one Soda. The food was average. I love my BBQ and because of that I am a tougher food critique then most. With or without me this place is going to succeed. It has a good location, nice outdoor space, and it is an unique offering. The business model works - the BBQ leaves something to be desired. I wanted this to be my go to spot and they let me down. I expect more from chefs running a place like Torches. Was it an off night?

Walked in the door on Friday 8/3/12 behind a group of 6 people. The hostess sat the group ahead of us and then walked right by us without an acknowledgment. Then she walked by us a 2nd time and said she would be right with us. While waiting, a group of 3 people walked in who were clearly friends with the hostess. After they chatted for a while she decided to seat her friends over us. When she returned to the hostess table she played dumb and asked us if we were waiting for a table. We were going to leave at that point, but decided to stick it out. Our waitress was great and the food was good. We had the Cuban sandwich and the smoked bologna. Both were very good. We also opted for sides of the beans and greens, and the mac and cheese. The beans and greens were good but I prefer more greens. The macaroni in the mac and cheese was really overdone and it wasn't cheesy at all. Overall, I liked the place, but i am not sure if I will go back. I can't stand an incompetent hostess. It really sets the tone for the rest of the evening.

This place was good once and terrible the second time when I did takeout. The ribs were great and fresh the first night and tasted like the day olds when I did pickup. I probably won't be back as I love love love Suzy Qs. She's never disappointed me.

The BBQ was out of this world. Melt in your mouth juicy. A little higher priced than average but worth it.

Went here with a friend for dinner after a coworker raved about the food there.  There was maybe enough parking spots for 5 cars in their "lot."  We parked in Walgreens across the street and hoped we wouldn't be towed.  We got there and were told it would be a short wait for a table.  We told them no preference indoors or out.  We waited over an hour for a table and nearly left.  I kept trying to ask anyone to give us a time frame, and no one could.  I could not tell who the hostess was.  Everyone seemed to be all over the place.  I saw next to no indoor seating, so I figured it would be outside on the deck.  That was fine.  It was.  Our table was extremely wobbly.  I guess this is to be expected being on the deck.  The chairs were awful.  They were terribly uncomfortable and kind of "reclined" which made trying to sit up to the table awkward.   Thankfully once we were seated our food came quickly.  I ordered a combo plate with pulled pork, a quarter rack of ribs, and two sides.  For sides I got their version of mac and cheese (which is somewhat unusual- pasta, with alfredo sauce, with bleu cheese, with goldfish crackers crumbled on top), and sweet potato fries.  They forgot the ribs initially, but brought them quickly once I pointed this out. The pulled pork was excellent.  The sauce was extremely tasty and the texture was just right.   I have no idea how they screwed the ribs up so baldy.  They were the texture of an overdone pork chop and I literally had to saw them apart with my knife and gnaw on them.  I threw most of them out. The mac and cheese was surprisingly good in my opinion.  My friend wasn't sure if she liked them or not when she sampled them. The sweet potato fries with honey/butter sauce were amazing.  Probably one of the top things I've ever had in a restaurant.  I'm not exaggerating.  They tasted like desert.  I would go back just for these.   Overall the food ranged from not so good to amazing.  The atmosphere had a lot of potential but was terrible.  It was much busier than that small space allows for, not adequately staffed, the staff seemed all over the place, and the music was WAY TOO LOUD.  My friend and I just gave up trying to converse, which is kind of the point of getting together with someone.  I'm hoping some of these issues are just kinks they need to work out and I'm hoping the food becomes consistently high quality.

What a blast! Great food, great staff....only 6or7 tables so parking/waiting are what you'll expect. Sides were all incredible as was the blacken Grouper. The 'must order' thing on the menu is "round of drinks for the kitchen - $6" Order that and see what happens!

5 Stars for Smoke on the Water.  Great food, very clean, unique entrees and the dessert was amazing. The cinnamon  cream cheese was by fat the best addition to a soft pretzel.  The service was outstanding and I will be returning!

First time here, definitely not my last. Walked in and got a very friendly greeting from the hostess but all the 8 or 9 tables were full so we had about a 20 min wait at the bar with a few locals. The place is small, a few tables and a bar, I imagine its nicer in the summertime with the patio, its no frills but at least its clean and very friendly. We were promptly brought water and menus and our server was very knowledgeable about what was on the menu and what was in the items on the menu. We started with the pigs in the blanket. I was expecting the usual mini hot dogs wrapped in Pillsbury dough but instead came this deliciously mild beer soaked brat wrapped in a flaky puff pastry that was filled with sauerkraut along with a sweet mustard. Then the St Louis ribs..big, tender, lean and meaty, the sauce was perfect and spiced just right. Along with that was the deep fried mashed potatoes which was good but I'd try something else next time, it was just to "heavy". The cole slaw though was deliciously different and when I asked our waiter what was in it, he said ..."love". My guest had the baked beans, oh, no ordinary baked beans, these were mixed with collards and I think oranges, The brussel sprouts were also a big hit. Well, I'm here so I might as well try dessert, funnel cake fries, (yes, funnel cake fries) along with bourbon coated baked apples and vanilla ice cream. Yea.. it was a bit too much, the funnel cake fries went home. All in all a great experience.

I had the pleasure of eating and enjoying some good entertainment at SOTW. We had ribs, beans and greens, and sweet potato fries. We wanted the Mac and cheese, but they were sold out. If the Mac and cheese was as good as the ribs, it's no wonder they sold out! The service was awesome! The Blackbirds provided great music. It was really nice! I would recommend anyone who appreciates true BBQ to visit Smoke on The Water!

Loved it! Start to finish great experience. First, I called to find out about reservations (yes for 5 or more, I had 2), the hostess told me she would put me on the wait list even though I haven't even left my house yet, awesome! So we get there much later ( babysitter issues) and find we have a little wait but just headed on over to the bar. The busy bartender somewhat asked what's wanted but by the time I lifted my head to tell her (few seconds?) she was gone! No problem, she came back quick enough and made me a yummy Bad Ass Margarita. A 6 top opened up so we decided to combine our efforts with two couples waiting at the bar and snap it up, best decision, so fun and the hostess went for it! Server was quick and pleasant with everything. I ordered the cornmeal encrusted Fried Green Tomato special, good but batter was too thick for me and made it feel almost stale- aioli was yummy though. New friend got the baked potato Hand Grenade and it looked AMAZING, ill definitely try that next time (along with every other app, because they all sounded killer and it was tough to choose- e.g. Sweet Chili Hog Wings...drool). I ordered the Cubano Sandwich with seasoned fries- all delicious. My husband ordered pick two with grouper and ribs, sides were Mac and cheese and Ta-tas (tots smothered in cheese and Franks!), so of course I tried all his food too to my delight! Atmosphere was warm and friendly, company and service was great, the place is small but we never felt rushed. I would go back again and again and I suggest you do too. Yum!

This new restaurant is pretty cool.  The location is great because it sits right on the canal in Tonawanda at the corner of main.  They have a large lower deck area where you can pull up in your boat, dock it, and eat BBQ!.  They also have a deck right off the back of the restaurant, where we sat.  The service was excellent, and accommodating.  My father was extremely taken with the smoker outside on their patio that they bring the meat out to cook in.  The inside was small, and we were lucky to sit outside because it was a nice day.  I ordered a 1/4 white chicken, and a wedge salad.  The salad was tasty, and had some BBQ sauce on it, along with the blue cheese.  The 1/4 was slightly dry.  Mark ordered a special which was a ham sandwich with honey mustard and fried pickles on it.  He said he thinks it was the best sandwich he has ever had in his entire life, and he continued to talk about for days after.

This is a cute little restaurant that I have been hearing a lot about. We decided to go there while passing it on our boat. We were able to dock right at the restaurant while we ate. The food was excellent! I ordered the shrimp ka-bobs and my boyfriend ordered the ribs. Both were really good and came with 2 large sides each. The ribs were very tender and seasoned very well.

Went here today for the first time. Wife and I both had ribs, chicken,sweet potato fries. Sat outside on the patio overlooking the murky looking creek that passes by.  Other than the creek that slowly creeps past this place everything about it is a hit. Service was friendly and efficient. Beer was chilled to the perfect coldness. Ribs fell off the bone and had the perfect crust on them. The BBQ sauce that comes to the table is sweet and thick and just delicious. Chicken had that red/brown BBQ skin that tasted as good as it looked and the meat underneath also did not disappoint. Beans and collards was delish and sweet potato fries were waffle fry cuts. The main bad point would be the limited parking available close to this establishment, and it might make it a little difficult on a wintry Buffalo night.  Otherwise, if you like BBQ and don't live down south, but up in WNY, then this place is a must!
