"As always, an afternoon spent at Escape is time invested well. Kelly is amazing - she listens and provides terrific personalized therapy. Meghan's facials leave me bright and glowing. Thanks to two professionals dedicated to providing superb services to their clients"
Stephanie and her staff are the absolute best at providing an exceptional experience. From the moment you enter the spa you know that everything is ok! I read that they won Best of the Emerald Coast for Massage! My experience has been the same as others, great massage and amazing customer service.
Escape Wellness Spa has the best staff in town.  BRANDY is the BEST EVER!!!!!
I am a salon owner in downtown Pensacola and am a very loyal customer when I find a business I like.  I have had massages by several different therapists in the 10 years I have lived here,and have also had several massages from spas in many cities while on vacation.  Stephanie is by far the best around!  The staff is friendly, they are always on time and the service greatly exceeds my expectations!
It's very hard to find a massage place in this town but I found two. This one wins hands down. The staff is very friendly and on-line appointments are available. Massage was great. Therapist was very knowledgeable and professional. Will definitely go again during my stay here.
Meagan provided a wonderful massage experience--making sure she addressed any tension areas and ensuring I left relax and without pain. Great addition."
I have had a lot of massages, but this is by far the BEST massage that I have ever had! Justin was great and so was his co-worker who did my friend's massage. (Unfortunately, I can't remember her name.) I can't wait to come back again! I have already recommended Escape to two other friends.
Tina is great. I'm here on vacation and feel fortunate to have found this spa.
