Great park for fun activities such as swimming in the pool, playing basketball/any sports and also just hanging out or having a picnic. Very close to SU and ESF and the Westcott area. They host shakespehere in the park during the summer and have a beautiful rose garden. They have a great outdoor amphitheater and can even host weddings! Whatever bad rep this park may have it can't be as bad as any other place at night- be safe and/or be in groups. During the day this place is a syracuse gem and should be filled during all seasons! The more that people are out there enjoying parks and nature, the better for the community, the park, and the well being of us all. Get out and play!!! :) I'll see you there!
A park in the city of Syracuse, near the SUNY-ESF and Syracuse University. Deer and turkey have been sighted in or near the park, despite it being surrounded by an urban environment. Might not be a good idea to go at night, but during the day I've never had any trouble. The park is also home to the Mills Rose Garden.
