A bit easy to miss walking through Armory Sq, have to walk into an alley-like turn and then turn left again to find entrance to this lovely little shop! Opened as a side project by owner to fund her projects in India; all profits go towards feeding kids. Clothing/accessories are unique and colorful! There's a little room for trying things on. Prices are reasonable and considering where the money is going, so worth it! Bought maroon bedsheet and bright teal balloon pants! Owner gave me a free large floral-patterned tote bag to hold all my stuff for the long trek home to University Hill!! Couldn't have been a better welcome to the city (it was during my first outing to downtown).
