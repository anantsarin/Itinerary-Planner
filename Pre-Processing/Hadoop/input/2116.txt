When you ask everyone in Jamestown where is a great place to get food they always suggest here. I have driven by it probably 5 thousand times in the last 7 years so I finally tried it out. The atmosphere was unimpressive and uninviting. The staff is very pleasant and nicely attentive. I had the chicken parm. lasagna which was just about the blandest meal I have ever had in my life. My guest had the chicken and dumplings which he said was pretty good so I'm hoping I just had a "bad" meal. I will go back again and hopefully will yelp about a better time than this one.

I have eaten here many times, but it has been a couple years, now in between. They are known for there extremely large portions, so much so, it's frankly a  waste of food. Prices seem high, because of the amount of food. Could cut the portions in HALF and the prices by 25%. We ordered, fish fry (HUGE) Shepard pie, Odd, it was a tasteless(no seasoning, at all. Very bland) meatloaf, with a layer of green beans, topped with mashed potatoes (not real). It was huge, like 3# of food. Seafood Alfredo was ordered too. It was shrimp and artificial crab meat in a heavy thick canned Alfredo sauce. Again NO SEASONING. very bland. Chicken Stir-fry was ordered. This looked good, lots of mixed veggie, frozen of course. Over cooked chicken. And of Course NO SEASONING.

This is a nice lunch spot just outside Jamestown with good specials that aren't on the regular menu. I got the special blue(cheese)burger and fries, which was absolutely yummy despite not being anywhere near the medium rare I asked for. It also came with lots of hot fries that were perfectly cooked - crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. Service was quick and friendly, and prices are not bad at all. There's also a full bar and free refills on at least iced tea. I'll definitely head back here and perhaps one of its other nearby locations next time I'm in town.
We stayed in Falconer on our way through western NY. This seemed to be one of the few restaurants in town. It was a Friday night and I was in the mood for a hamburger, but was disappointed to find that their lunch menu (that included safe and inexpensive items like hamburgers) was not available for dinner on Friday and Saturday nights.  The menu was extremely large and varied, which has to make you wonder how fresh the ingredients can possibly be and how many of the items can possibly be made from scratch (vs. being pre-prepared and frozen by Cisco).   The cheapest things on the menu were basic pasta dishes for $12, which is kind of an expensive pasta dish unless your getting freshly made pasta. There was a strip steak special for $20, which also seems overpriced for this cut unless your getting it "prime", aged, and/or grass fed.   We ended up getting the fish fry, since it was one of the lower priced items ($13) and seemed like the safest bet.  We definitely get our moneys worth in terms of the sheer volume of food. The fish came with three sides (cole slaw, fries, bread role) and easily could have served two hungry people. We essentially ended up paying for two dishes each. You can't help but wonder if this is a tricky way to squeeze more business out of their customers. The fish and fries were good, but not great. The cole slaw was bland.  The service was sluggish and preoccupied (not sure why since less than half the tables were occupied). Overall, it was not horrible (and I'm sure is a fine place for lunch), but for fine-dining the basics (service, quality, appropriate portions, and fair prices) were not there.

Great and fast service. Large portions with every meal. Nice atmosphere.

Great food for a great price. Friendly staff. Try the fish fry. We go there like every other week. You get a lot of food for the price.
