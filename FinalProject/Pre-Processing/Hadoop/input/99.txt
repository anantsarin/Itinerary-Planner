A friend of mine took me here when I was up visiting and boy am I glad she did! This is a really neat rehabbed firehouse which contains hand-made wares from the greater Rochester area and beyond. A great place to find gifts, there is something for every price range. Pottery, jewelry, paintings. Love the basset hound who hangs out. Just a fun place.
I rented studio space from this place for a summer.  It was a fantastic time!  They give  you access to all their wheels, tools, glazes and kilns.  I got a 24 hour access key and would come at my leisure and throw all night long jammin' out to my ipod-- bliss Pottery is such a time intensive, sensitive, and expensive hobby to have but for those of us who cannot live without it, this place makes it easy to keep up.  They are supportive and accomadating. Only removing one star because the place is so expensive.  You must buy your own clay, pay a fee for glazing, and kiln firing is by weight so, as it goes with pottery, it gets expensive. I would recommend taking a pottery class here as I've heard the teachers are great and they give you studio access during the time that you are a student.
Attended the Chili Cookoff hosted by Yelp in the Genesee Center for Arts building on Monroe Ave.  Cool setup.  Pottery looked great.  I may even consider taking a class here. The people who work there and take classes there made bowls for the Chili Cookoff so everyone who attended received 1 bowl of their choice.  There seemed to be no two bowls alike.  Love that!
