The Setnor School of Music is located in Crouse College on the Syracuse University campus. The school seeks to present live music in the face of a changing 21st century. The school's departments focus on Education, Industry, Performance, and Composition & History of Music. As a performing arts venue, the Setnor School of Music presents free performances of music in the historic Setnor Auditorium. Parking for concerts and events is convenient and available for free in Q-1 and Irving Garage. Music has thrived at Syracuse University since 1877, when the Department of Music was founded and SU became the first university in the United States to grant a degree in music and require four years' study in both music and theory. Now known as the Rose, Jules R., and Stanford S. Setnor School of Music, the school continues this proud tradition by offering professional-level training through six undergraduate and four graduate degree programs that allow talented musicians and future music industry leaders to excel both collectively and as individuals. The Setnor School of Music seeks to integrate community into the practice of live music-making. The school maintains a commitment to combining with high school groups, and houses the Syracuse Youth Orchestra, Allegro Youth Wind Ensemble, and the Syracuse Children's Choir.
