We made a point of going here after having a mediocre experience at the other location, as we heard this one is much better. First of all, this place is an absolutely nuthouse at 9am on a Sunday. There were easily 20 people in line. We wanted to go for the hot food bar where they had biscuits & gravy among other things, but the line was so long that we were afraid our food would be cold before we got to pay. It did indeed take about 15 minutes to reach the counter, which is really the only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5. They just didn't have enough registered open. I will say one thing about New York: People get in line like they're supposed to (instead of trying to cut) and they will almost always move out of the way if you say "excuse me". I can't say the same of other states I've lived in. The food here is superior, the service is pretty good, and the coffee is fantastic. The scones are a bit dry, but almost everything is a home run. The menu is extensive and I'm looking forward to exploring the rest of it.
The Napoleons are tough, but better than their baklava (it's got something that tastes like red bean paste in it), and sometimes the pepper is hard to find. But they have Ciao Bella gelato, which is quite possibly among the best things in all the world. I've eaten lunch here a couple of times and have not been sorry. The coffee's cool, spanakopita is A+ (big serving, too), and the potatoes rock well. There is a man who works here that I like a great deal. He has a funny smile and he always wears a hat. He helped me find the pepper once.
Variety, quality and originality -- all are 5 stars. I'd give the service courtesy a 5 as well, but the service speed a 2 or 3. It often takes 5-10 minutes to get even a simple coffee & bagel w/ cream cheese order fulfilled. But that's a small gripe in a place of BIG choices and big taste. It's really impossible to go wrong here -- a staple of the Finger Lakes dining scene.
Chocolate cherry sourdough, excuse me, yes, yes you heard right. Pick one up and put it in your mouth. Mine didn't make it to a knife, just ripping off chunks works too. Croissants were used in a recipe and held up to eggs and homemade larmelade.
Not a bad place to eat. I am a bit spoiled living in Brooklyn. The food was good, not great. Gluten free sandwich was better than average. My BLT needed a little more B. Prices are a little too high, $10 for a sandwich that was a little small. Roast beef sandwich lacked flavor.     Had a conversation with a cashier who made some negative comments about my friend being from New Jersey, slightly rude but I chalked it up to a hipster trying a little too hard to be cool. We will give it another shot next time we are in town.
I wanted to review something, and what better than my favorite bakery in my hometown... perhaps the country... This place has been a family staple since we first got cable TV in the 80s. Back then Wegmans didn't have its delightful bagels, and it was hard to find a good nova bagel done right anywhere outside the City. Fast forward to 2008 and everything is as solid as ever! The pecan sticky buns are still my favorite, unchanged from memory of highschool brunches past. This place will forever remind me of good times in I-town, I wish you guys continued success!
Try to pick a sandwich to order when you arrive in under 5 minutes I dare you! This place is worse than Collegetown Bagels when it comes to deciding what to get! There are so many choices to go with and every single one is as amazing as the next. The biali and focaccia are my bread of choice of course of course. I like the bagels too. They always put a good amount of meat and cheese and veggies if your ordering them on your sandwich and never fail to satisfies my lunch cravings but the reason for the 4 stars and not 5 is the price. These sandwiches are so freaking pricey it's kind of ridiculous. I understand this is aiming to get money but for the size sandwich you get it's definitely something I think may or may not be worth the price. On one hand the sandwich flavor is great and there's a lot of meant but really when I get down to paying for it I question whether or not it's worth it. Overall I keep going back but less and less and I continue to go less as the prices start to deter me more and more. But if you got money to blow and want a good sandwich then this is the place for you. Also the upstate Banh Mi on Focaccia might be the best thing ever....
I enjoyed the breakfast food and coffee selection here. Although a tad overpriced, they definitely have a large and fresh selection. The ordering and waiting queue is a bit hectic. As a newcomer, I had no idea what was going on. They have plenty of staff behind the counter, but no one really 'directing traffic' in the store. Overall, it was enjoyable and I'd stop in again!
There is such a great selection of sandwiches here. Whoever created the menu did a great job of putting a creative or unusual element into most of the sandwiches to take them from run-of-the-mill to yummy. When ever I am in town, IB is one of the stops, whether it is for breakfast or lunch. I have had a couple baked treats from here, and I didn't love them, but I am also not a huge baked goods person. I haven't had any of the hot bar items except for the soup. When I have had the soup it was just ok. I am pretty happy sticking to the sandwiches. Avoid this place when it is really busy though-- its really just too crazy.
A college staple!  Ithaca Bakery and it's Collegetown Bagels counterpart got me through weekend study sessions both due to the food and the space for hunkering down with a text book and lecture notes.  Their sandwiches are delicious (I always add sprouts and avocado!) and their baked goods ever beckon you to consume the sweet sticky goodness.  This location has a reasonable selection of other goodies including yogurts, grab and go salads and sandwiches, and an extensive selection of hot sauce, jam, and tea.  All in all a pleasant experience but there's limited parking in the lot.
Delicious! Really wonderful place. Very friendly staff. Great baked goods. Delicious coffee. Look forward to going back for a sandwich.
There are actually a lot of reasons I want to give less stars.  Often my lunch orders get messed up, the hot bar could be soooo much better, and I think the coffee is pretty gross.  And the microwaved eggs at breakfast are truly a crime. Ummmmm so why 5 stars then? They actually have more than 5 stars - every person that works the early shift.  The morning staff is so great that they make me want to work there.  They are more than just friendly and prompt and much much better at their jobs than some of the workers later in the day.  They create a wonderful community vibe - they remember names, greet customers enthusiastically, and bring a great sense of humor and energy to work every day.  I'm a super early riser, and I appreciate talking to people who are actually awake and engaged by 7am! I like the Ithaca Bakery just fine - decent bread (though you can certainly find better in town), an excellent selection of sandwiches (l especially love ove the Italian panini, the parisian, and the upsate bahn mi), yummy desserts, etc.  But really it's all about the fab morning crew, thank you guys!
I have lived in Ithaca for 20+ years and have eaten at the IB many many times. At this point I think it is out of habit rather than for the food quality. I resent being served microwaved eggs. The food consistency is spotty and the quality does not reflect the price. look at the prepared food in the case, does it look fresh and inviting? or more like leftovers? Bagels are good, but not the best in town. There are so many places in town that simply do it better for less. PS. If the parking lot is full, don't bother, the wait will be interminable.
Everything is good.  Love the local foods and and ingredients.  Seating can be tough....especially during the weekends...besides the fantastic bagels, I recommend the sweet Rachel for lunch and the Brooklyn sandwich for breakfast.  Chai is some of the best around
Five stars just for knowing that it's not an 'everything' bagel it's a _Long Island_ bagel. Say it with me: Long Island bagel Ithaca Bakery is my first stop whenever I manage to get back to Ithaca. It continually saddens me that I just can't find a bagel as good as an Ithaca Bakery bagel anywhere in Seattle. These bagels have been my ideal bagel since childhood: glossy crust, very chewy, and available in many varieties. A toasted Long Island with cream cheese is pretty much the best thing ever. I flew back to Seattle with a dozen after christmas and I carried them in my hand luggage because I was worried about my checked luggage not making it back with me. All of the bakery's bread products are winners though. If you've never had the Becks'n'Cheddar you're missing out on one of the most delicious bread experiences available. Just don't buy my loaf. The other prepped food items range from good to very good. The soup is especially satisfying; there was one shrimp gumbo that I remember being particularly transcendent a few years ago.
I'm not sure why there is so much hype over Ithaca Bakery. The bagels are pretty good. The hummus as well. The list ends here, for me. I otherwise find the food to be just OK. I've tried a few dishes (really trying to let Ithaca Bakery grown on me), most recently a tofu scramble sandwich. I had to douse it in ketchup before I found it edible. I brought my parents here, and they were disappointed their eggs were made in a microwave. I can't blame them. The prepared (vegan) food items I've tried have been nothing but underwhelming and bland. The bread is just so-so. Ithaca Bakery is far too crowded for my liking, and I just can't see why. Perhaps I'm missing something.
Unfortunately...I have not been here! (Food delivery.) But if you take a look at the picture associated with this review, you'll understand why I had to review the spot. The Grub -- * West Willow BBQ Specialty Sandwich($8.50) - Local pulled pork in Dino BBQ Sauce, topped with house-made coleslaw, on our fresh-baked Honey roll * Medicinal Traditional Tea - Gypsy Cold Care Venue Review -- As mentioned earlier, I haven't been to this specific property, but I have passed through Ithaca Bakery's Triphammer Mall location and I liked its atmosphere. Very cozy, seeing as it's tucked away into a corner of the mall. The restaurant is wide and spacious with a nice flow around the open air bakery area through which you can see many baked goods, loaves, and pastries to nibble on. I'm assuming it'd be pretty similar here. Food Review -- If you take one look at the picture I've posted with this review, you'll know why Ithaca Bakery is getting a 5-star review in the Food Category. Seriously, would you look at that sandwich? The best part is, it tasted even better than it looked. The West Willow BBQ was perfect, not too much sauce, and the mountain of pulled pork dwarfed the coleslaw - in my opinion, that's how every pulled pork sandwich should be made. Each bite was a juicy, sweet & salty, savory piece of heaven. In short, this sandwich was something from God's own lunch menu. Service Review -- Ithaca Bakery actually delivers for FREE. Crazy, huh? As long as you order between 11am - 2pm, they'll deliver straight to your door Monday through Friday. The delivery woman was very nice, but I had one hiccup. I had scheduled my delivery through their website for the 12:30pm-1pm time frame (you can choose) but they arrived at 11:30am...what if I hadn't been home? Oh well, I wasn't hungry yet so I had to wait and reheat the burger when lunch hour came around. Overall Impression -- Besides the fact that my food arrived an hour early (which seems like an odd complaint), the experience was great. Being sick, it was a great change not to be cooking and to have a ready-made meal. I'm looking forward to dining on-site in the future and I already know what I'm ordering when I get there!
Try not to gag as a woman who just wrapped a grueling Bikram session wanders about the bakery air drying herself while looking for oolong. I know the town is Earthy and environmentally friendly and blah-blah-blah, but when did ignoring personal hygiene fall into that bucket? I suppose one bad apple has spoiled the bunch for me here. There are a lot of options, I suppose, but grab 'em and hit the road.
what a wonderful place! whether you want to snack or stuff it's perfect. The chopped liver is to die for. and just a huge selection of different types of food from hot plates to soup and sandwiches. enormous selection, easy quick payment and you can shop for chutney etc for home. great bakery, try the croissant. big and buttery. if you are in Ithaca avoid the many fancy and expensive places and try here. you won't regret it. if you can afford it take home some of their wonderful smoked salmon.

What Ithaca lacks in areas of interest for business travelers, Ithaca rocks when it comes to cafes & other local cuisine. Starting with the Ithaca Bakery for breakfast, lunch or an early dinner, Lost Dog Cafe in the commons, Maxie's Supper Club, or hot truck sandwiches at Shortstop Deli. All serious dining experiences.   Do you fancy gourmet coffee, fresh baked goods, a hot breakfast,  and a sandwich with avocado for the road. Fancy a particular taste for you palate, look no further. Like a department store, but better.
I lived in Dryden my whole life, then went to school in Boston. The bagels from here / Collegetown Bagel are the (non-living) thing I miss most. I always order a plain bagel toasted twice with cream cheese, and they come out perfect. Nothing in Boston compares. Bagels there are too thin, or never get toasted enough, or don't have enough cream cheese- and they get cut in half twice, which makes them harder to eat and carry. Boston seems like the logical place for these amazing Ithaca bagel places to expand- it's collegetown bagel, right? Boston is FULL of colleges! It fits! I'm grateful to my parents. I know that as long as they live, even when I'm out of college and am entirely supporting myself, they'll still be doing something wonderful: living in Ithaca, giving me a reason go there (and a place to stay when I do)  and eat delicious bagels.
I'm writing to update my review.  A representative of the business got in touch with me to apologize for my previous experience at their establishment, which I think speaks very highly of it. I had a much better experience last week, when a friend and I stopped into the Triphammer location for brunch/lunch.  I had a Michigan Hollow  sandwich; he had an Eggs Christina. My Michigan Hollow (marinated portobello mushroom, cheese, multigrain roll) was excellent.  No complaints about the portion size or execution.  My friend enjoyed his Eggs Christina, too.  Joint was packed, as usual, but we got our meals in a reasonable length of time.
Almond horns. That is all.
Whether you live in Ithaca, or are simply here for a visit, the Ithaca Bakery won't let you down.  However, IB is more than a bakery--it's a foodie's heaven.  They do a great job of integrating local food into their menu.  The food is freshly prepared and they don't skimp on ingredients.  There's even a hot bar and salad bar if you prefer something other than sandwiches.   Personally, I have my favorite sandwiches (Jib's Jaybird, Jay's Meal, and Eggs Melissa, to name a few). For sandwiches I tend to substitute whatever bread they suggest for the ciabatta--way good. Bagel varieties are extensive (love the Rosemary Salt, Asiago Cheese, and Sun Dried Tomato).  And they make REAL bagels (not the soft, "bready" kind the chain bakeries tend to serve).  Their soups are always very good (they post their daily offerings on their Facebook page and website). If I'm hosting visitors from out of town I always take them to IB. It's funny, many of my friends who visit regularly go to IB on their way out of town to pick up bread and sandwiches for their drive home. It does get really busy on the weekends, but the lines move quickly so don't be alarmed if you show up and it looks swamped.

Growing up in the Ithaca environs, I've spent considerable time eating at Ithaca Bakery and the various Collegetown Bagel locations.  I love the ambiance and the creativity of the food offerings.  That being said, in recent years, my experiences with this local establishment have been only a notch above average.  Several issues: 1) Inconsistency in preparation of sandwiches and specialty bagels.  Big, big issue in recent years.  Why is there nothing resembling standardization in preparation? Workers need to be on the same page here:  Sometimes I order a San Diego and the bagel is toasted, while other times it is not; sometimes there is a one-inch thick layer of cream cheese and other times a smear; I order a Dewitt Melt and instead of listed coleslaw there's sprouts on top; and so on.  I feel like a male primadona having to outline every little detail of my order to approach a consistent product visit to visit.  In the past (4-5 yrs ago), this didn't seem to be an issue. 2)  Bagels are good, but not great.  Frankly, Wegmans are better.  But, they're usually well-stocked with the basics.   3)  Prices.  I'm not sure the quality-to-cost ratio is quite there.... Seriously, prices have continued to creep upwards so that a sandwich now costs $8-$9.  The Mexican--A  bagel with cream cheese, tomato, and muenster is over $4.00.  To be fair, the breakfast sandwiches are still a reasonable deal and often delicious, but come on. What I'm trying to say is that in the past I'd take visiting friends to Ithaca Bakery/Collegetown Bagels in a heartbeat, while today I'm less inclined to make the effort.  I think most people CAN enjoy the place, but regular patrons (which have figured out the ordering game) probably find this place the most rewarding.

Ordered a customized cake. Icing was thick and flavorless. Cake was dry and the filling was too thick and wet which weighed down what little cake there was. I bought this cake for a special occasion which was embarassing when everyone just pushed it around their plates. If a bakery cannot get a simple cake right, I doubt it will make me want to return. Should have gone to Wegman's Update: I returned the cake...received a refund...no questions asked...nice staff.

Very average experience all around. Prices were fairly reasonable.  This was one of the bigger places I ate it in Ithaca
I liked the atmosphere of this place!  Great to eat-in, if you can find a seat, lol. Very busy on the weekend. The bagels were good, but nothing that special.  The Rye bagel is my favourite.  Unfortunately they had no pumpernickel bagels.  The Black and White cookie was great with a soft cake underneath. Vanilla cupcake is ok. Service was outstanding at the counter--very friendly.

Love Ithaca Bakery and all the CTB locations. Their prepared meals are very good. I got the stuffed portobello mushroom with saffron risotto and that was very good. Their homemade soups are also good. Their sandwiches are the best. Creative choices, huge variety, very vegetarian/vegan friendly, you'll definitely find something you like here. I loved The Sherwood Forest (Balsamic-marinated Portobello mushroom, tomato, pesto, Mozzarella cheese on our Ciabatta bread, $7.75). The bread was fresh and warm, the portobello mushroom was thick, juicy, and very tasty. My favorite is the Viva Chelsea (Fresh mozzarella cheese with fresh basil, tomato, extra-virgin olive oil, salt and pepper on rosemary focaccia bread, $6.35). I always get it warmed up, because I like the mozzarella cheese melted and the rosemary focaccia bread a little crunchy. I love this place! The huge variety, freshness of ingredients, deliciousness, and reasonable prices always make me come back for more! Oh, and make sure to take advantage of their Free Lunch Delivery service from Monday-Friday between 11 am-2 pm. You can order online or call them.

Stopped in for a coffee and a pastry before heading out to Taughannock Falls on a rainy Sunday morning.  The coffee was very good and the lemon bar was huge and as close to perfection as a lemon bar can be.   We were seduced by their sandwich selection and intrigued by the Sloppy Joe soup so we returned after doing some exploring for lunch.  Both of our sandwiches were creative and delicious and the soup, while a little disappointing (I built it up too much in my mind), was still pretty darn good.   You can't go wrong at Ithaca Bakery; there is something for everybody.  It might be the most complete bakery anywhere.

This place is top nocth. One of the things that I like is their monthly themed menus (e.g. Mexican,   Barbeque,  Tomatos)...   The only problem is that many of the items on these menus are avialable only one day of the week...   That is a problem for someone who lives eighty  miles away.

I come here reasonably often on the weekends for lunch. I enjoy sampling from their wide variety of sandwiches, and the service is usually good. I like that the store sells a mix of local and foreign snacks and cheeses that you can't find in a regular store. I have mixed feelings about their coffee though. The brewed coffee is pretty good, but not as good as the coffee you can get from one of the Ithaca's many local coffee specialists. When I've bought their Cayuga coffee beans to make coffee myself, I've found the taste to be disappointing compared to coffee from other local roasters.   Overall, it's a great place to go for lunch. I particularly recommend any sandwich with Dinosaur BBQ sauce on it.

Yikes! Where do I look first? So much pressure (in a good way). So many sandwiches, entrees, salads, bagels, bakery goodies, and a ton of coffee choices! The "Regulars" aka Cornell and Ithaca students would buzz in & out, they knew the routine, I'm merely a rookie in this well-oiled machine. Since I was just passing through town on a looonnnggg road trip...I was skeptical of where to eat.  But how can you miss a place that has the biggest crowd hanging around. I thought....it must be good...let's try it. Best egg & cheese on a bagel and pumpkin spice coffee ever....so good! With a small-town local touch, countless choices, indoor or outdoor eating areas, & some heated lamps outside....I'm a big fan! I'm also a people watcher, and was definitely entertained...kind of made me wish I was back in school again. Brought back good memories:)

You'd be hard pressed to go here and NOT find something tasty to eat - the menu is ridiculously extensive, written on blackboards that extend across the entire store.  There are breakfast sandwiches, lunch sandwiches, salads, pastas, soups - everything.  And as several others has mentioned, the bagels are out of this world.  I challenge anyone from New York City to find a better bagel. November is my favorite time of year because the pumpkin bagels re-emerge form their summer hibernation. Pumpkin bagels..... mmmmmmm..... *drool*

I enjoyed this place during the year I lived in Ithaca.  It was a good place to get a good solid meal at a decent price.  I found their sandwiches to be excellent, along with their breads, and deserts.  My go to was their hot food bar, its about 8.95 per lb but if you are smart you can get good value for your money.  Sometimes the salads are a little wilted so you have to pick at it a little but it's not that bad.  However, overall it was a good experience: solid food, decent price, and a good atmosphere to eat it in.  It was fun while it lasted!

With a small-town local touch, countless choices, indoor or outdoor eating areas, & some heated lamps outside....I'm a big fan! I'm also a people watcher, and was definitely entertained...kind of made me wish I was back in school again. Brought back good memories:)
I would love to give this place a better star rating but two things leave a sour taste in my mouth. "THE RENT IS TOO DAMN HIGH" Yes, you are an amazingly good bakery with cool ideas for sandwiches. No, you should not charge an arm and a leg for them.   EDIT* After reading other reviews the eggs are microwaved. They look and taste like they came out of a tin, but they are indeed real eggs "cooked" via microwave.
You'd be hard pressed to go here and NOT find something tasty to eat - the menu is ridiculously extensive, written on blackboards that extend across the entire store.  There are breakfast sandwiches, lunch sandwiches, salads, pastas, soups - everything.  And as several others has mentioned, the bagels are out of this world.  I challenge anyone from New York City to find a better bagel. November is my favorite time of year because the pumpkin bagels re-emerge form their summer hibernation. Pumpkin bagels..... mmmmmmm..... *drool*
I have mixed feelings as others do. I love baked goods and am on the road for work and stop at just about any bakery that I pass. I have to say that if I am in the area, I do stop in. Though, admittedly, it is for a few old standby items that I like. I guess what it really boils down to is the cookies. The jumbo mocha chocolate chip cookies are AWESOME! Compared to the majority of the rest of the items, reasonably priced. The Ginger cookies are good as well. I also like their desert stone cookies. The hot food bar has some pretty appealing items but the per pound price does not make it worth it. I had a sandwich once and it was not bad, but not great enough that I have ever ordered another. If you are in the area, I think it is the best bakery. I also want to say that some of the staff are super friendly and seem are less than friendly. I have found that more recently they are not as nice.
I enjoyed this place during the year I lived in Ithaca.  It was a good place to get a good solid meal at a decent price.  I found their sandwiches to be excellent, along with their breads, and deserts.  My go to was their hot food bar, its about 8.95 per lb but if you are smart you can get good value for your money.  Sometimes the salads are a little wilted so you have to pick at it a little but it's not that bad.  However, overall it was a good experience: solid food, decent price, and a good atmosphere to eat it in.  It was fun while it lasted!
The sandwiches are mainly quite good. The pastries are simply horrid. Most of he time I have been here, it has been extremely crowded. I think here are better choices in Ithaca for sandwiches and deli stuff. This is merely ... Just barely ok.

We're from out of town, and each time we visit Ithaca, we make it a point to patronize Ithaca Bakery at least once for breakfast or lunch. The place can be overcrowded and loud, but the sandwiches and bagels are outstanding, and we appreciate the many vegan options.

Amazing... Love the local foods they offer and the set up, some of the sandwiches are a bit pricey but I have never had anything bad so generally it is worth it. The vegetarian bagel is my favorite by far and it is reasonably priced, I highly recommend trying it!

Amazing place!  Tons of options for breakfast and lunch.  Lots of yummy desserts and treats too.  I shared the Sherwood Forrest sandwich with my mom.  If you are sharing a sandwich be sure to let them know, when they brought out the sandwich it was on two plates each with a pickle!  We will definitely be going back while we are in Ithaca.

Wow what a lunch!  This place was awesome. I would highly recommend for a quick bite. Can't wait to try another meal. Lots to choose from with a terrific variety of things to try.  The California was out of this world. Fresh from the start. Next time I will make more time to really get my lunch on in this joint. Quick service without the hassle.

Love Ithaca Bakery.  Sandwiches are the bomb- so many original options.  Good bread and baked goods.  Nice outdoor seating.  Service is quick and always with a smile.  This is an Ithaca institution.

Yesh!! Vegan options! Their vegan pastries were great. They sell fresh bagels with vegan selections and I was amazed. I became so addicted to bagels after having it here. A tofutti vegan pizza bagel. Wow. Imagine bagel bites but better because it was fresh and bigger! Vegan cream cheese topped with melted cheese topped with a tomato on a bagel. Doesn't that sound great? Yes!! Perfect match! Creamy and not dry. It's purely genius.

It is not Christmas with out a Buche de Noel from Ithaca Bakery. Sadly, they do not ship. I was lucky three years ago to have one flown out for the holidays, and since then I have been trying to make my own.

The Ithaca Bakery - especially the main branch on Meadow/Route 13 - is a decent place to stop if you are visiting Ithaca or passing through town. They have a large selection of original sandwiches, baked goods, and drinks. It is a local "institution" where you can pick up a nice loaf of bread and snacks for your trip; everyone who knows Ithaca will ask you if you went there. But, if you live in Ithaca or visit town regularly, I think their high prices and the inconsistency in quality and wait time make it difficult to justify regular visits. A lunch sandwich, chips, and coffee can easily run $15-17. There are many better lunch options in town in that price range. The "Farm to Bakery" sandwiches, all of which feature locally-sourced ingredients and cost $9-11, are particularly tempting but extremely inconsistent: sometimes they are delicious, other times I throw out half of a burnt sandwich filled with tough meat. I have been disappointed far too many times at the Ithaca Bakery.

Amazing sandwiches..I and my wife had the tomato mozzarella and Mediterranean hummus sandwich - the bread was super fresh and the taste was great. We had asked for salt pepper and ketchup with the sandwich but never used any. 5/5 Also had a salted caramel iced coffee which is very refreshing. Had Melissa bagel and everything bagel with chive cream cheese the next morning..nothing special or exciting about these. The service was very slow probably due to too many people in the shop. 3/5

I stayed in a hotel right behind the plaza housing this lovely establishment and I was lucky it was there because even with cars we might not have found a better place for an easy breakfast.  I had a coffee and an everything bagel with cream cheese (it came with two orange slices, a nice touch) and my grand total was under $5.  Menu for lunch looks huge and interesting, so I might have to come back to sample some soup and sandwich.  The people who work here are friendly and there has been a constant stream of customers while I have been sitting here so it obviously meets the locals approval too.

On vacation and stopped in for breakfast.  I love places like this.  I like the vibrant atmosphere and the quick and friendly staff.  The selection is incredible.  What a fun place.  I thought the coffee was pretty good.  My egg, guac, salsa wrap could have had more seasoning but I still think a great place to stop in.

Great food - a little pricey and the place is always packed on weekends.

I've been here twice, once for breakfast and once for lunch.  Both meals were to die for.  The bakery is situated right on rt13, so it gets busy during the day and a frenzy when Cornell and Ithaca College are in session.  I think it's one of the best places to eat in Ithaca for a quick and healthy meal.  Their menu is extensive, the staff is very friendly and will even crack jokes with you!

Love Ithaca bakery, since they have expanded they now offer so much! They have everything from soups, coffee, bagels, salad bar, organic food, and they now have extra seating. You can always find something to eat and they have decent pricing. They also offer wireless Internet connection.

It feels like I am going against the tide here, but I am consistently underwhelmed and disappointed by both Ithaca Bakery and Collegetown Bagels. The extensive sandwich menu seems so exciting, but invariably ends up being disappointing. And totally overpriced! I ended up spending $30 on lunch for two recently. Seriously?! I also hate the layout/service set up in almost every location, and how busy it gets. The only thing I can count on is the egg and cheese (Eggs Melissa) on a rosemary salt bagel. Yum! But even that is done better at Manndibles.

We loved grabbing a quick breakfast and coffee at this bakery while in town for a conference. Service was very friendly and they have an entire list of vegetarian and vegan options, woot!

I love going to Ithaca bakery and getting their Upstate Banh Mi.  They also have quite nice potato bread. I've never been a fan of CTB, but I'm a big fan of Ithaca Bakery which is strange but true.

you won't find better baked goods in ithaca (and maybe all of central NY.) the prepared foods and sandwiches are awesome (i forget exactly what it was called, but the taughhannack something is the best sandwich i've ever had.) cheesecake brownies? the cheesy and brownie-est i've ever had. the bagels! the cheddar chive bicuit! i could go on & on. growing up, my dad worked in ithaca, and i'd always beg him to bring things home for my after work. it was always a huge treat when he'd show up with an ithaca bakery bag. when i got older, in the winter i'd be driving up rt. 13 to get to greek peak and i'd always make a point to stop there for breakfast. so many good, delicious memories.

The Ithaca Bakery (and, tangentially, its sister outposts, Collegetown Bagels) has a lot going for it. The space is interesting and newly expanded, the staff is usually cool, friendly and efficient, the menu full of variety and and good-will, if rather overwhelming. It's also a great place to meet-up with people, is eco-friendly, family-owned and, apparently, a great place to work. Regretfully, I have some gripes, though. Why don't I list them for yous? Their menu is ridiculously hard to read. Don't bring a foreigner, a child, your parents or anybody from out of town here unless you have a few suggestions for them. It's overwhelming and practically impossible to read in the time you have before they call on you to order. Do more with less? Make it simpler somehow. The prices are overreaching. Sometimes I get my food, I pay, and once at the table just look at what's on the table and say to myself "Again? I just paid $16 for this?!" I mean, a sandwich has got to be pretty spectacular to cost in the $7-$8-$9 range and at least come with chips or a side besides a pickle or look really fetching on the compostable (props!) paper plate. The quality is good but the quantity is not always, nor are there any of the little "extras" that make you feel like you've gotten a good value for the money. The coffee is very often weaker or older than it should really be at a very busy bakery/cafe. They have several varieties. I wish they'd stick to one kind and just get that consistently right. (I once asked the counterperson which kind was freshest at that moment and got a blank, unfriendly look and no answer.) The bagels often want for freshness (gasp!). Rarely have I gone in and been able to get a hot, fresh bagel without it being toasted. How can this be? And, they toast "by default".  A really good bagel should not need to be toasted. The space in most of the locations (esp. Triphammer! never. again. ) is maddeningly inefficient. Why have us wait on two separate lines for your overpriced  food? Don't you see how shitty this is? Hire a consultant about efficient use of space. They really don't need more customers; I wish they'd look inward just a bit and try harder, give a little more for what they charge. I think that all the slobbering reviews here testify to the fact that we all really WANT to love this place. Maybe I haven't drunk the IB Kool-Aid because real love eludes me.

Almost $14 for a sandwich, a medium coffee and a liter of water, albeit the meat on the sandwich was good, I didn't get cheese on the sandwich (which is how I ordered it) and the vegetables were extremely low quality. The sprouts were brown, the cucumber looked like it was dumpster dived and very institutional lettuce. How does this business get away with this and stay in business. The coffee was good, that and the fact that they had gluten free bread for my sandwich gives them two stars. The price and the nasty produce made the rating low. C'mon guys, it's the height of the summer with multiple farms that have killer produce around. Why use some nasty stuff when there is so much good produce around. The penny pinching tactics won't be needing any excuses.

Wonderful establishment!  After our first experience there, I walked out saying that I wanted one at home.  service is fantastic, coffee is great, and a wonderful variety of breakfast and lunch dishes - including many vegetarian and vegan options.

We pick up dinner from Ithaca Bakery at least once a week. Awesome variety. Lots of vegetarian options.  Soups, hot bar, and deli case items change all the time. If there isn't a ready-made item that is appealing that night, there is a huge selection of customizable sandwiches. Bagels and breads are great too.  Blueberry bagels are a favorite at our house. Super fast service. Ithaca Bakery uses and carries lots of local items. Vegetarian friendly. Some vegan options too. Can be crowded at lunch. The expansion a couple years ago makes seating area much more spacious.
This place is awesome with all their different vegetarian options. Really healthy and tasty. Wish we had one in Philly! Reminds me of panara bread but ten times better.
We were unhappy with a birthday cake and the owner immediately responded with a refund offer. You can't beat that customer service! We are definitely going back here on every trip to visit daughter in college in Ithaca.
One word: excellence. Ithaca bakery is completely devoted to it's food. Sure, we had a snafu involving banana peppers on the sandwhich, I got the monthly special, but it is testament to the quality of food that I didn't notice until my friends asked me where the peppers were. Not only that, but the crew is friendly and willing to answer all your questions. The bread is well made and flavorful, the meats are meaty and good, and the service is friendly. Words cannot describe the excellence, you MUST try them if you are in the area.
We found  a little piece of heaven, right in Ithaca, NY! From the smell that greeted us at the door, the excellent choices of breakfast sandwiches, to the great selection of coffee, this bakery hit the mark!
Good stuff!  If only the counter person wasn't so into talking (yap yap yap!).  We wanted the California brunch burrito and a phyllo dough creation with eggs, ham, spinach.  Got the burrito, but she gave us french toast.  hmmm.  I decided not to complain and just eat the french toast (three small pieces of thick cinnamon raisin bread).  You get your choice of sides- local new potatoes or a somewhat water logged fruit salad.  I went back to the register to pay for a copy of the NYT, and she was still yapping away.  This time she was blathering about how Ithaca is starving Latinos.  OK, whatever,  gimme my damn coffee already. Ithaca Bakery also has a lovely array of foodie condiments (jams, sauces, etc), soup mixes, and Ixchel tortilla (blue and white) chips.  The cheese selection looked decent- could compliment their good looking breads.
I feel this place should easily be able to score a rating higher than 2 stars - all they have to do is not serve microwaved eggs.  The bagels were good and the breakfast sandwich selection strong and interesting.   But they are tremendously undercut with a blog of microwaved eggs.  The coffee also wasn't that good.  The lively atmosphere is what you come for.
Love everything about this place. It's definitely a staple for the Ithaca community.
Lunch here Monday and, wow, what an amazing place! Choices seem endless and variety of food choices is impressive. From deli to buffet, soup to nuts, this place has everything, and pulls it all together in a way I've seldom experienced. Funky and fun. B and I just had sandwiches - hers pulled pork and mine a Thai-themed creation with chicken and cukes - but both outstanding. Plus Blairs ultra-hot chips! What's not to like?
This place is amazing! Had lunch on our first trip to Ithaca because of the good Yelp reviews, and we weren't disappointed! Great atmosphere and great sandwiches. So many to choose from it was hard deciding. Can't wait to go back and try more! Thanks fellow yelpers!
JEWEL OF ITHACA! Delicious everything, fresh & plenty of options! Great atmosphere and central location, very very friendly and helpful staff! Would definately recommend to anyone in the area, I will be back myself next time I'm visiting Ithaca!
I tried this place because of the reviews.  The breakfast sandwich was really good even though they got the order wrong and it wasn't what I asked for.  And the cinnamon roll I had was just as good. I went back for coffee and I was disappointed.  It tasted watered down and no flavor too it.  Reminded me of the Dunkin' Donuts coffee I had on my drive up from Manhattan; aka terrible.   Since the cinnamon roll was good I decided to try the oatmeal raisin cookie that looked amazing but I admit I was WRONG.  It tasted like they used too much flour just so they could make the cookie larger.  I would prefer a "normal" size cookie that tasted good for $2 then stretching the ingredients.
DELICIOUS sandwiches and cider, okay desserts
Loved how open and bright the bakery was.  Lots of seating.  Good local foods selection.  Split two of their farm to table selections:  upstate ban mhi & Eddie's free bird.  Both bursting with juicy meat and fresh veggies.  Excellent!  Friendly service as well.  Would be 5 stars were it not for the fact that none of the breads are 100 % whole grain.  Would love to have at least one selection that is.  Still, you know I'll be back.
Ithaca Bakery is in a league of it's own. It's simply amazing. I lived in Ithaca for 5 years while attending undergrad and grad school. I brought every out-of-town guest to Ithaca Bakery and across the board, was everyones favorite. Space used to be a big issue (as this place gets PACKED on the weekends) but since the recent renovation there is a ton of seating inside and out. I miss this place most of all.
Great place to take a family (or yourself) for a healthy breakfast or lunch.  The menu is diverse enough for all tastes and the restaurant is very laid back. The coffee is also exceptional.
This is my favorite place to stop every time I go to Ithaca. They have a huge variety of foods for breakfast, lunch, or diner - salads, soups, breads, delicious sandwiches on thickly sliced bread (Pumpernickel or whole wheat), pre made meals, desserts, drinks, you name it!  They are a bit on the pricey side, especially with the desserts, but everything is really well done.  I cant say enough great things about this place.
Great selection of bagels, breads, sandwiches, entrees and desserts as well as drinks and fair trade coffees. Their sandwiches are the best with an eclectic selection to choose from. You've got to see their menu. Daily specials and other locations, known as Collegetown Bagels, spread throughout the city. Casual counter service type place and you can't beat the aromas inside. Great place to come for an after church bite to eat or on your way to the Farmer's Market.
If there is a downfall to this place (there isn't), it's having too many options.  There's something for everyone here, and the service was great!  Sandwiches galore, tons of beverages, breakfast, lunch, salad bar, it's all here.  Next time I'm in Ithaca, I'll definitely be going back here.
This place is simply fantastic!  The people, the atmosphere...and the food!!  I have tried several dishes from here including the salad/food bar.  Never had a bad meal.  I have personally grown a favorite to their freshly made to order sandwiches.  Favs Are:  "The Octopus" & "Turkey Hill BLT".
The prepared food is great, if a little pricey (only reason for the docked star).  I love the ambiance--definitely a classic Ithaca spot.
The bagels are decent and sandwiches too. But has anyone actually looked at that Hot Bar? That stuff looks older than my grandma. You're going to charge me around $7/lb. for some left overs? No thanks! They simply have far too many products to control the quality of them all.
Mmmmmmm delicious iced coffee!!
okay folks this is the bee's knees. i stopped in three times while on a weekend visit to ithaca.  twice in one day. i ordered the tuscan verde - chicken breast, presto, spinach and tomato on rosemary focaccia.  it was delish and the bread was chewy and herby at the same time.  my pals and i had plan to take the sammies to the waterfalls but i couldn't resist biting in.  i ended up eating half before we left.  we went back for cupcakes to surprise a birthday gal.  i though the cupcakes were aiiight, but nothing to brag about.  they did have some bbq a going on saturday and a shame i didn't capitalize on the brisket.  maybe next time. we stopped by on sunday to get the famed chocolate cherry bread.  my friend got two loaves.  def a repeat visit when upstate again.

Yum!! For a guaranteed delicious lunch get the Milanese sandwich!

Sure, we had a snafu involving banana peppers on the sandwhich, I got the monthly special, but it is testament to the quality of food that I didn't notice until my friends asked me where the peppers were. Not only that, but the crew is friendly and willing to answer all your questions. The bread is well made and flavorful, the meats are meaty and good, and the service is friendly. Words cannot describe the excellence, you MUST try them if you are in the area.
I've been to Ithaca Bakery several times now, and have enjoyed it for the most part.  Their breakfast sandwiches have been great, and they make the best spanakopita I have ever had (I think that they add parsley to it, which is unconventional but highly delicious).  However, they do not get a 5, because I actually don't like their bagels that much (overly dry), and have not been impressed with the cookies/pastries I've tried.
We found  a little piece of heaven, right in Ithaca, NY! From the smell that greeted us at the door, the excellent choices of breakfast sandwiches, to the great selection of coffee, this bakery hit the mark!
Where do I go? I can never figure out where to order or who is next in line - the staff often cannot figure it out either and have no idea how to organize themselves or the customers. Too much confusion to get a simple sandwich. Last time I was there, five people were doing nothing behind the counter (talking or "re-organizing", one person making a sandwich, 3 people milling around. I stood by the counter for a minute or two with no acknowledgment before someone called to help a lady standing behind me. (I guess I smell bad? not really)  I give it credit because the sandwiches are usually better than Panera and more unique than Short-Stop, but at least at those places, I can figure out where to order, and someone often gets to me right away. If you are looking for something unique - Collegetown Bagels (same company as Ithaca Bakery) is located in Triphammer Mall, East Hill Plaza, or heaven forbid, Collegetown. Mostly, the sandwiches at Collegetown Bagels are the same. If you want a lazy lunch and are not in a hurry or don't have other things to do with your life and like to be confused, go to Ithaca Bakery! They have put up signs to help "order here", but the staff are not paying attention.
Good stuff!  If only the counter person wasn't so into talking (yap yap yap!).  We wanted the California brunch burrito and a phyllo dough creation with eggs, ham, spinach.  Got the burrito, but she gave us french toast.  hmmm.  I decided not to complain and just eat the french toast (three small pieces of thick cinnamon raisin bread).  You get your choice of sides- local new potatoes or a somewhat water logged fruit salad.  I went back to the register to pay for a copy of the NYT, and she was still yapping away.  This time she was blathering about how Ithaca is starving Latinos.  OK, whatever,  gimme my damn coffee already. Ithaca Bakery also has a lovely array of foodie condiments (jams, sauces, etc), soup mixes, and Ixchel tortilla (blue and white) chips.  The cheese selection looked decent- could compliment their good looking breads.
Great fresh, fast breakfast and you don't have to have bagels.  My husband and I both had delicious breakfast wraps.  Juice selection could have been better (only Tropicana OJ!?!?)
I feel this place should easily be able to score a rating higher than 2 stars - all they have to do is not serve microwaved eggs.  The bagels were good and the breakfast sandwich selection strong and interesting.   But they are tremendously undercut with a blog of microwaved eggs.  The coffee also wasn't that good.  The lively atmosphere is what you come for.
I recently visited my daughter who is attending Ithaca college. We stopped in for a quick snack. My daughter is vegan so she is limited her food choices. She told me this was one of her favorite eating places and has lots of vegan friendly choices. We enjoyed our meal but when we left my daughter forgot her sweatshirt. She did no realize this until she got back to her apartment. She called Collegtown and being a honest business they had put is aside. When you visit Ithaca the Collegetown Bagel should be on the top of your list as a place to enjoy a meal. Thanks for your great food and honest business dealings.
Love everything about this place. It's definitely a staple for the Ithaca community.
Good breakfast environment. Recommend their oatmeal and bagels.
Lunch here Monday and, wow, what an amazing place! Choices seem endless and variety of food choices is impressive. From deli to buffet, soup to nuts, this place has everything, and pulls it all together in a way I've seldom experienced. Funky and fun. B and I just had sandwiches - hers pulled pork and mine a Thai-themed creation with chicken and cukes - but both outstanding. Plus Blairs ultra-hot chips! What's not to like?
This place is amazing! Had lunch on our first trip to Ithaca because of the good Yelp reviews, and we weren't disappointed! Great atmosphere and great sandwiches. So many to choose from it was hard deciding. Can't wait to go back and try more! Thanks fellow yelpers!
JEWEL OF ITHACA! Delicious everything, fresh & plenty of options! Great atmosphere and central location, very very friendly and helpful staff! Would definately recommend to anyone in the area, I will be back myself next time I'm visiting Ithaca!
I tried this place because of the reviews.  The breakfast sandwich was really good even though they got the order wrong and it wasn't what I asked for.  And the cinnamon roll I had was just as good. I went back for coffee and I was disappointed.  It tasted watered down and no flavor too it.  Reminded me of the Dunkin' Donuts coffee I had on my drive up from Manhattan; aka terrible.   Since the cinnamon roll was good I decided to try the oatmeal raisin cookie that looked amazing but I admit I was WRONG.  It tasted like they used too much flour just so they could make the cookie larger.  I would prefer a "normal" size cookie that tasted good for $2 then stretching the ingredients.
DELICIOUS sandwiches and cider, okay desserts
Loved how open and bright the bakery was.  Lots of seating.  Good local foods selection.  Split two of their farm to table selections:  upstate ban mhi & Eddie's free bird.  Both bursting with juicy meat and fresh veggies.  Excellent!  Friendly service as well.  Would be 5 stars were it not for the fact that none of the breads are 100 % whole grain.  Would love to have at least one selection that is.  Still, you know I'll be back.
Ithaca Bakery is in a league of it's own. It's simply amazing. I lived in Ithaca for 5 years while attending undergrad and grad school. I brought every out-of-town guest to Ithaca Bakery and across the board, was everyones favorite. Space used to be a big issue (as this place gets PACKED on the weekends) but since the recent renovation there is a ton of seating inside and out. I miss this place most of all.
Great place to take a family (or yourself) for a healthy breakfast or lunch.  The menu is diverse enough for all tastes and the restaurant is very laid back. The coffee is also exceptional.
This is my favorite place to stop every time I go to Ithaca. They have a huge variety of foods for breakfast, lunch, or diner - salads, soups, breads, delicious sandwiches on thickly sliced bread (Pumpernickel or whole wheat), pre made meals, desserts, drinks, you name it!  They are a bit on the pricey side, especially with the desserts, but everything is really well done.  I cant say enough great things about this place.
Great selection of bagels, breads, sandwiches, entrees and desserts as well as drinks and fair trade coffees. Their sandwiches are the best with an eclectic selection to choose from. You've got to see their menu. Daily specials and other locations, known as Collegetown Bagels, spread throughout the city. Casual counter service type place and you can't beat the aromas inside. Great place to come for an after church bite to eat or on your way to the Farmer's Market.
If there is a downfall to this place (there isn't), it's having too many options.  There's something for everyone here, and the service was great!  Sandwiches galore, tons of beverages, breakfast, lunch, salad bar, it's all here.  Next time I'm in Ithaca, I'll definitely be going back here.
This place is simply fantastic!  The people, the atmosphere...and the food!!  I have tried several dishes from here including the salad/food bar.  Never had a bad meal.  I have personally grown a favorite to their freshly made to order sandwiches.  Favs Are:  "The Octopus" & "Turkey Hill BLT".
The prepared food is great, if a little pricey (only reason for the docked star).  I love the ambiance--definitely a classic Ithaca spot.
The bagels are decent and sandwiches too. But has anyone actually looked at that Hot Bar? That stuff looks older than my grandma. You're going to charge me around $7/lb. for some left overs? No thanks! They simply have far too many products to control the quality of them all.
Mmmmmmm delicious iced coffee!!
okay folks this is the bee's knees. i stopped in three times while on a weekend visit to ithaca.  twice in one day. i ordered the tuscan verde - chicken breast, presto, spinach and tomato on rosemary focaccia.  it was delish and the bread was chewy and herby at the same time.  my pals and i had plan to take the sammies to the waterfalls but i couldn't resist biting in.  i ended up eating half before we left.  we went back for cupcakes to surprise a birthday gal.  i though the cupcakes were aiiight, but nothing to brag about.  they did have some bbq a going on saturday and a shame i didn't capitalize on the brisket.  maybe next time. we stopped by on sunday to get the famed chocolate cherry bread.  my friend got two loaves.  def a repeat visit when upstate again.
A GREAT place for breakfast or lunch!! I had a sesame bagel with smoked whitefish salad & it was DELICIOUS!!!
Yum!! For a guaranteed delicious lunch get the Milanese sandwich!
Their sourdough cheddar chive loaf is amazing.
I've been to Ithaca Bakery several times now, and have enjoyed it for the most part.  Their breakfast sandwiches have been great, and they make the best spanakopita I have ever had (I think that they add parsley to it, which is unconventional but highly delicious).  However, they do not get a 5, because I actually don't like their bagels that much (overly dry), and have not been impressed with the cookies/pastries I've tried.

Good breakfast environment. Recommend their oatmeal and bagels.
This was a pit stop before driving back to Boston.  The place was busy during lunch.  The menu was overwhelming but everything sounded great.  I asked the cashier what he recommended and went with a sandwich that had ham and brie.  I thought he said the bread was challah or French Toast but it turned out to be ciabatta bread- I think it was The Euro.  The husband had a pastrami sandwich which was loaded with meat and was warm and fatty.  My sister had a croissant sandwich with vegetables(Cayuga croissant).  Lots of selection for everyone including a lot of vegetarian options.  They had these almond cookies to sample that were really good - like almond macaroons.
I always eat here when I come to Ithaca. Everything is delicious. My fav is the soho croissant and the medusa. This place is great for both lunch and dinner. The best part is the staff is friendly even to us out of state tourists!
Excellent spot and highly recommended for breakfast and lunch. Sandwiches are all on super fresh bread. BLT on toasted sour dough was excellent. The "Earl's Ham & Honey" (ham/cheese/arugula/cucumber/stoneground mustard) was fantastic, especially on the fresh baked onion roll. Very friendly service and reasonable prices. Check it out.
If you haven't already noticed, I'm a pessimist.  I know I have a bad habit of looking for the negative instead of finding the positive.  So there's that.  I'm not making any excuses for myself.  Just putting it out there. So in light of the above I'm about to write a somewhat negative review about Ithaca's beloved bakery.  Partly because it deserves it, partly because I'm in a bad mood. My favorite part about the Ithaca Bakery is what it used to be.  You know, back in the '70s and '80s, when they literally only sold fresh bread at a reasonable price.  Present day, I have a love/hate relationship with this place now.  For every chocolate croissant that I love, there's a mediocre hot bar.  For every one of my toasted salt bagels with cream cheese, lox and capers, there is crappy daily soup.  For every whimsical "LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLAAAAAAAAAURAAAAAAA!" that is sung into the microphone to tell me that my order is ready, there is a pretentious snotbag taking lunch orders on the phone. I recently admitted to myself that my favorite "Brooklyn Bagel" is indeed mostly made up of freaking FAKE EGGS.  This infuriates me!  How can an establishment that continually toots the locally grown horn serve me fucking Sysco eggs that come in a god-knows-how-old-gigantic container!?  Ithaca Bakery I beg you, get rid of this crap.  I can't be the only person this bothers. I guess this is more a rant than a review.  So I'll wrap this up: Pros: Chocolate Croissants Tomato/Oil Dipping Sauce Bagels Broadway performer on mike Great juice selection Italian bread Cons: Overpriced Pastries and cakes are Meh Fake Fuckin' Eggs Hot bar needs help Soup should be comfort food.  Ithaca Bakery soups scream in my face and tell me they hate me.
The book is still open on this place for me.  There were a lot of great looking menu items.  I am a sucker for a hot corn beef sandwich so that is what I had.  No frills, just grain mustard on rye.  It was good, but a little dryer and tougher than I like though seemed cooked fresh.  I like my corned beef steamed and juicy.  Since I am in town working near here, I will try tomorrow. One other thing.  You may want to check out the menu before you go.  It is substantial with coomplicated and interesting choices.
Two words: MICROWAVED EGGS also, the hot bar often lacks variety and you will often see 2 very similar dishes placed at opposite ends as if they are fooling people. The sandwiches on the other hand are always awesome and the baked goods are usually great, although very few vegan options. The staff there is always fun and friendly.
This place used to have SO much more charm... now it's huge, crowded, the menu is overwhelmingly large, and there are different places to line up and place your order? It used to be quaint and they'd call your name to pick up your food - now you sit and wait for the server. I used to come here every weekend when I was a student at Ithaca College, but upon a recent visit to Ithaca this past weekend, I walked in and was SO confused! It's hectic, chaotic and I felt so rushed to make a decision because it would've taken me 20 minutes to read the menu! As for the food, I ordered a chicken curry sandwich but asked for it on a plate instead of in sandwich form since I didn't want the bread. It was tasty. My husband ordered a sandwich that had roast beef on it - either it wasn't sliced thin enough or the pieces were just too big in general because he couldn't bit through it. It was super messy and very frustrating to take a bite and then have the ENTIRE slice of beef come out of the sandwich. It was tasty, but not ideal. A little overpriced as well, and that's coming from a reviewer who lives right outside of NYC and its prices. Good, strong iced coffee is a plus.
I came to Yelp today thinking I was going to write a good review about this place, but after I just saw a review below that says the bakery uses carton eggs from Sysco - which is like the most terrible deception for an eatery selling themselves as a local establishment (trying to think how that is so different from Starbucks trying to pretend as a local business) I changed my mind. I had thought they use all the local eggs and local ingredients. This is a terrible disappointment. I wonder if they use Sysco eggs for their breads and cookies too. Other than these issues, it's a nice place to spend a couple of hours of your day - big windows, lots of natural light. Much better than some coffee places that have extremely narrow tables - i guess that's to encourage people not to stay for too long. I hope IB people would leave me alone while I work there as long as I keep my coffee cup filled or munching on something from their bakery.   Ah yes, this place needs more outlets.  I have found two outlets so far that I can use. Come with your battery fully charged.
Great coffee, friendly folks behind the counter, delicious bagel sandwiches what's not to love?  I stopped for breakfast on the way out of town and really like the friendly funky vibe.
On one fine morning, after a peaceful night sleep at my brother's new off-campus house to Cornell, I was eager to try any local breakfast nooks. He recommended Ithaca Bakery (yet never having been there himself. Yeah, no car...) after hearing some rave reviews. Open-minded as well as pretty famished, we headed here at around 10-11 on a weekday. There was quite a lot of people milling about the place but the bakery itself was capacious so there was definitely room to walk around as well as short queues. You could even buy freshly baked breads through glass panels lining the wall and stands. Not to mention, there was also an enticing hot foods bar. Yes, I was eyeing the biscuits and gravy!! I ordered a refreshing iced chai latte. bit.ly/14EUoKk I loved it but there was just too much ice! I definitely should have told them to cut down on that because I finished it so quickly. 4/5 My brother's mouthwatering Steak and Eggs breakfast sammie arrived and it looked quite delectable! bit.ly/18zbRIu This deliciousness contained roast beef, scrambled eggs, roasted red peppers & melted Pepper Jack, on a toasted Plain bagel. Then, my large, buttery croissants were done too. bit.ly/1cIJv4m Oh my god, they were perfectly moist, flaky, and decadent-pairing well with my latte. 5/5 I  shared my sister's Bronx Bagel breakfast sammie.The bagel was toasted beautifully! Crunchy outside, chewy inside. Perfectly cooked eggs and flavorful sausage. All together, it worked cohesively in this warm handful delight. I'm salivating just typing this part up. It was that good. bit.ly/129OZ0W 5/5 Before we left, my brother noticed that I was FAMOUS on the menu!!! bit.ly/16rwOYd When I ever head back to Ithaca to visit, I will definitely come back here for breakfast! Appreciative prices, fulfilling high-quality meals, and great service. Oh, and my notoriety there as well? Heehee!! Nothing is better than that. :D
It's a must if you're visiting Ithaca. It's a landmark really. Not fast food, not big box junk. Delicious homemade food. Great soups and the sandwich selection is unreal. They bake their own bread that available to take home. We always get a few loafs and freeze them!
My husband and I were passing through Ithaca and stopped here for a quick bite. Since it was in the AM we went for breakfast sandwiches, both of which had eggs in them. The eggs tasted very, very "off" to me, and I noticed there was no natural white and yellow marbling that you would find in true scrambled eggs. I've worked in food service and quickly realized the eggs were not true eggs but likely egg-like substance that comes from a carton, often from a big food service company. To give Ithaca bakery a benefit of a doubt I asked one of the staff members where the eggs were from, and he confirmed that they were from a carton, purchased from Sysco. For a place that seems to draw most of its customers in with its use of "local" and "farm to bakery" type foods, I was surprised to discover such low, low food quality among its products.  It seems sneaky, and I wanted future potential customers to realize what they are getting when they order meals with eggs at Ithica bakery. BTW, companies like sysco also sell batter and dough for baked goods. It might be worth checking if they truly make other products like cookies from scratch, or if those come in some form from an larger food company.
We ate dinner here this weekend and what a place.  They have every sandwich you could ever imagine, and they will make whatever you can imagine that isn't on the menu.  They had samples of a few different kinds of cheese on a few of their different selection of bread that you could try out. Everything tasted incredibly fresh, they made it very quickly considering they were cutting up all the ingredients right there.  There was a mistake made in one of our orders and they fixed it immediately and apologized for making the mistake.  There was staff walking the store talking to you about different things they offered and explaining the different things that they had tried. One of the best bakeries I have eaten at in a long long time.  Definitely highly recommended if you are in Ithaca.
This was a quick pit stop for us. It was busy as it was a holiday. I was overwhelmed by the menu. I ordered J's Meal on gluten-free bread. It was good but the bagel sandwiches coming out looked better. I would get something different next time. I tried a white chocolate raspberry scone. It was good but I could tell they didn't make it that same morning. Take some time with the menu. I would come back but wouldn't get the same thing. I would give 3 stars except they do support local farms so I'm giving it 4.
As "out of towners" we were totally confused.  There are almost too many menu options.  You get lost looking at the huge board on the wall.  The woman who took our order had no patience for us in our lack of knowledge on how things operate there.  Our egg and cheese on a bagel, which is a melissa?! I guess, was super bland.  They microwave the egg and the bagels just weren't very good.  Everything in the cases and on display looked delicious, but we were so flustered we just wanted to go hiking already.
We made a point of going here after having a mediocre experience at the other location, as we heard this one is much better. First of all, this place is an absolutely nuthouse at 9am on a Sunday. There were easily 20 people in line. We wanted to go for the hot food bar where they had biscuits & gravy among other things, but the line was so long that we were afraid our food would be cold before we got to pay. It did indeed take about 15 minutes to reach the counter, which is really the only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5. They just didn't have enough registered open. I will say one thing about New York: People get in line like they're supposed to (instead of trying to cut) and they will almost always move out of the way if you say "excuse me". I can't say the same of other states I've lived in. The food here is superior, the service is pretty good, and the coffee is fantastic. The scones are a bit dry, but almost everything is a home run. The menu is extensive and I'm looking forward to exploring the rest of it.
In Ithaca for weekend and our host told us about Ithaca Bakery.  We enjoyed brunch so much that we went back for lunch the next day.  The sandwiches are enough for 2.  Loved the coffee and atmosphere of the bakery.
Variety, quality and originality -- all are 5 stars. I'd give the service courtesy a 5 as well, but the service speed a 2 or 3. It often takes 5-10 minutes to get even a simple coffee & bagel w/ cream cheese order fulfilled. But that's a small gripe in a place of BIG choices and big taste. It's really impossible to go wrong here -- a staple of the Finger Lakes dining scene.
My son is a super picky eater and he likes the Reuben sandwich here.  Coffee is pretty good.  I love the vast selection of different types sandwiches, however it made choosing one too hard when you can only order one.
Not a bad place to eat. I am a bit spoiled living in Brooklyn. The food was good, not great. Gluten free sandwich was better than average. My BLT needed a little more B. Prices are a little too high, $10 for a sandwich that was a little small. Roast beef sandwich lacked flavor.     Had a conversation with a cashier who made some negative comments about my friend being from New Jersey, slightly rude but I chalked it up to a hipster trying a little too hard to be cool. We will give it another shot next time we are in town.
This place is what Panera wish it could be. Panera always has a through put problem but not here. The sandwiches are creative and not too bad on the wallet. I got the thai chicken curry panini  and the Ira's big fish special i think that's what its called. The was panini good but the big was was terrible because it wasn't on a bagel. Teh smoked fish and cream cheese needs to be on a bagel. But over all its nice to order your item or in my case items and they give you a # and someone brings your food out. Seating was plentiful but it was still packed on the Sunday morning my sausage party was there.
Try to pick a sandwich to order when you arrive in under 5 minutes I dare you! This place is worse than Collegetown Bagels when it comes to deciding what to get! There are so many choices to go with and every single one is as amazing as the next. The biali and focaccia are my bread of choice of course of course. I like the bagels too. They always put a good amount of meat and cheese and veggies if your ordering them on your sandwich and never fail to satisfies my lunch cravings but the reason for the 4 stars and not 5 is the price. These sandwiches are so freaking pricey it's kind of ridiculous. I understand this is aiming to get money but for the size sandwich you get it's definitely something I think may or may not be worth the price. On one hand the sandwich flavor is great and there's a lot of meant but really when I get down to paying for it I question whether or not it's worth it. Overall I keep going back but less and less and I continue to go less as the prices start to deter me more and more. But if you got money to blow and want a good sandwich then this is the place for you. Also the upstate Banh Mi on Focaccia might be the best thing ever....
The thing that really impresses me about IB is that they make everything look very appetizing. They have almost anything you could want for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  I was especially surprised to see the hot bar and salad bar that they have. Lately there has been vast improvements in this department and the food on the hot bar is better than ever. I would highly recommend the food here especially compared to the other places in town that have hot bar items such as Greenstar and Wegmans because they have a wide variety of options and it always looks presentable. Also the food does not look like it has been sitting underneath a heat lamp for multiple hours unattended to like most places. I also would recommend trying almost any sandwich on the menu they are all delicious!
I enjoyed the breakfast food and coffee selection here. Although a tad overpriced, they definitely have a large and fresh selection. The ordering and waiting queue is a bit hectic. As a newcomer, I had no idea what was going on. They have plenty of staff behind the counter, but no one really 'directing traffic' in the store. Overall, it was enjoyable and I'd stop in again!
I couldn't imagine anyone going here and not being able to find something to eat. They have EVERYTHING! Had the veggie burger on a multigrain roll that was amazingly fresh and the hummus veggie sandwich. Food was fresh and on point. I'll be back for sure.
There is such a great selection of sandwiches here. Whoever created the menu did a great job of putting a creative or unusual element into most of the sandwiches to take them from run-of-the-mill to yummy. When ever I am in town, IB is one of the stops, whether it is for breakfast or lunch. I have had a couple baked treats from here, and I didn't love them, but I am also not a huge baked goods person. I haven't had any of the hot bar items except for the soup. When I have had the soup it was just ok. I am pretty happy sticking to the sandwiches. Avoid this place when it is really busy though-- its really just too crazy.
We ordered The Milanese and The Italian. Both of us enjoyed the The Milanese. The Italian was saltier than we prefer but at no fault of the sandwich makers. Prosciutto and salami are salty by nature so we have to slap or own wrists for that mistake. The best part of the sandwich was by far the rosemary foccacia bread. Can't wait to take another trip to Ithaca so we can grab lunch here. We bought a loaf of Rosemary foccacia for a mere $3.75! Bonus: They sell a lot of specialty products by small, local businesses.
A college staple!  Ithaca Bakery and it's Collegetown Bagels counterpart got me through weekend study sessions both due to the food and the space for hunkering down with a text book and lecture notes.  Their sandwiches are delicious (I always add sprouts and avocado!) and their baked goods ever beckon you to consume the sweet sticky goodness.  This location has a reasonable selection of other goodies including yogurts, grab and go salads and sandwiches, and an extensive selection of hot sauce, jam, and tea.  All in all a pleasant experience but there's limited parking in the lot.
This was a pit stop before driving back to Boston.  The place was busy during lunch.  The menu was overwhelming but everything sounded great.  I asked the cashier what he recommended and went with a sandwich that had ham and brie.  I thought he said the bread was challah or French Toast but it turned out to be ciabatta bread- I think it was The Euro.  The husband had a pastrami sandwich which was loaded with meat and was warm and fatty.  My sister had a croissant sandwich with vegetables(Cayuga croissant).  Lots of selection for everyone including a lot of vegetarian options.  They had these almond cookies to sample that were really good - like almond macaroons.
Delicious! Really wonderful place. Very friendly staff. Great baked goods. Delicious coffee. Look forward to going back for a sandwich.
I always eat here when I come to Ithaca. Everything is delicious. My fav is the soho croissant and the medusa. This place is great for both lunch and dinner. The best part is the staff is friendly even to us out of state tourists!
There are actually a lot of reasons I want to give less stars.  Often my lunch orders get messed up, the hot bar could be soooo much better, and I think the coffee is pretty gross.  And the microwaved eggs at breakfast are truly a crime. Ummmmm so why 5 stars then? They actually have more than 5 stars - every person that works the early shift.  The morning staff is so great that they make me want to work there.  They are more than just friendly and prompt and much much better at their jobs than some of the workers later in the day.  They create a wonderful community vibe - they remember names, greet customers enthusiastically, and bring a great sense of humor and energy to work every day.  I'm a super early riser, and I appreciate talking to people who are actually awake and engaged by 7am! I like the Ithaca Bakery just fine - decent bread (though you can certainly find better in town), an excellent selection of sandwiches (l especially love ove the Italian panini, the parisian, and the upsate bahn mi), yummy desserts, etc.  But really it's all about the fab morning crew, thank you guys!

I recently admitted to myself that my favorite "Brooklyn Bagel" is indeed mostly made up of freaking FAKE EGGS.  This infuriates me!  How can an establishment that continually toots the locally grown horn serve me fucking Sysco eggs that come in a god-knows-how-old-gigantic container!?  Ithaca Bakery I beg you, get rid of this crap.  I can't be the only person this bothers. I guess this is more a rant than a review.  So I'll wrap this up: Pros: Chocolate Croissants Tomato/Oil Dipping Sauce Bagels Broadway performer on mike Great juice selection Italian bread Cons: Overpriced Pastries and cakes are Meh Fake Fuckin' Eggs Hot bar needs help Soup should be comfort food.  Ithaca Bakery soups scream in my face and tell me they hate me.
I have lived in Ithaca for 20+ years and have eaten at the IB many many times. At this point I think it is out of habit rather than for the food quality. I resent being served microwaved eggs. The food consistency is spotty and the quality does not reflect the price. look at the prepared food in the case, does it look fresh and inviting? or more like leftovers? Bagels are good, but not the best in town. There are so many places in town that simply do it better for less. PS. If the parking lot is full, don't bother, the wait will be interminable.
Everything is good.  Love the local foods and and ingredients.  Seating can be tough....especially during the weekends...besides the fantastic bagels, I recommend the sweet Rachel for lunch and the Brooklyn sandwich for breakfast.  Chai is some of the best around
Two words: MICROWAVED EGGS also, the hot bar often lacks variety and you will often see 2 very similar dishes placed at opposite ends as if they are fooling people. The sandwiches on the other hand are always awesome and the baked goods are usually great, although very few vegan options. The staff there is always fun and friendly.
Five stars just for knowing that it's not an 'everything' bagel it's a _Long Island_ bagel. Say it with me: Long Island bagel Ithaca Bakery is my first stop whenever I manage to get back to Ithaca. It continually saddens me that I just can't find a bagel as good as an Ithaca Bakery bagel anywhere in Seattle. These bagels have been my ideal bagel since childhood: glossy crust, very chewy, and available in many varieties. A toasted Long Island with cream cheese is pretty much the best thing ever. I flew back to Seattle with a dozen after christmas and I carried them in my hand luggage because I was worried about my checked luggage not making it back with me. All of the bakery's bread products are winners though. If you've never had the Becks'n'Cheddar you're missing out on one of the most delicious bread experiences available. Just don't buy my loaf. The other prepped food items range from good to very good. The soup is especially satisfying; there was one shrimp gumbo that I remember being particularly transcendent a few years ago.
I came to Yelp today thinking I was going to write a good review about this place, but after I just saw a review below that says the bakery uses carton eggs from Sysco - which is like the most terrible deception for an eatery selling themselves as a local establishment (trying to think how that is so different from Starbucks trying to pretend as a local business) I changed my mind. I had thought they use all the local eggs and local ingredients. This is a terrible disappointment. I wonder if they use Sysco eggs for their breads and cookies too. Other than these issues, it's a nice place to spend a couple of hours of your day - big windows, lots of natural light. Much better than some coffee places that have extremely narrow tables - i guess that's to encourage people not to stay for too long. I hope IB people would leave me alone while I work there as long as I keep my coffee cup filled or munching on something from their bakery.   Ah yes, this place needs more outlets.  I have found two outlets so far that I can use. Come with your battery fully charged.
I'm not sure why there is so much hype over Ithaca Bakery. The bagels are pretty good. The hummus as well. The list ends here, for me. I otherwise find the food to be just OK. I've tried a few dishes (really trying to let Ithaca Bakery grown on me), most recently a tofu scramble sandwich. I had to douse it in ketchup before I found it edible. I brought my parents here, and they were disappointed their eggs were made in a microwave. I can't blame them. The prepared (vegan) food items I've tried have been nothing but underwhelming and bland. The bread is just so-so. Ithaca Bakery is far too crowded for my liking, and I just can't see why. Perhaps I'm missing something.
On one fine morning, after a peaceful night sleep at my brother's new off-campus house to Cornell, I was eager to try any local breakfast nooks. He recommended Ithaca Bakery (yet never having been there himself. Yeah, no car...) after hearing some rave reviews. Open-minded as well as pretty famished, we headed here at around 10-11 on a weekday. There was quite a lot of people milling about the place but the bakery itself was capacious so there was definitely room to walk around as well as short queues. You could even buy freshly baked breads through glass panels lining the wall and stands. Not to mention, there was also an enticing hot foods bar. Yes, I was eyeing the biscuits and gravy!! I ordered a refreshing iced chai latte. bit.ly/14EUoKk I loved it but there was just too much ice! I definitely should have told them to cut down on that because I finished it so quickly. 4/5 My brother's mouthwatering Steak and Eggs breakfast sammie arrived and it looked quite delectable! bit.ly/18zbRIu This deliciousness contained roast beef, scrambled eggs, roasted red peppers & melted Pepper Jack, on a toasted Plain bagel. Then, my large, buttery croissants were done too. bit.ly/1cIJv4m Oh my god, they were perfectly moist, flaky, and decadent-pairing well with my latte. 5/5 I  shared my sister's Bronx Bagel breakfast sammie.The bagel was toasted beautifully! Crunchy outside, chewy inside. Perfectly cooked eggs and flavorful sausage. All together, it worked cohesively in this warm handful delight. I'm salivating just typing this part up. It was that good. bit.ly/129OZ0W 5/5 Before we left, my brother noticed that I was FAMOUS on the menu!!! bit.ly/16rwOYd When I ever head back to Ithaca to visit, I will definitely come back here for breakfast! Appreciative prices, fulfilling high-quality meals, and great service. Oh, and my notoriety there as well? Heehee!! Nothing is better than that. :D
Unfortunately...I have not been here! (Food delivery.) But if you take a look at the picture associated with this review, you'll understand why I had to review the spot. The Grub -- * West Willow BBQ Specialty Sandwich($8.50) - Local pulled pork in Dino BBQ Sauce, topped with house-made coleslaw, on our fresh-baked Honey roll * Medicinal Traditional Tea - Gypsy Cold Care Venue Review -- As mentioned earlier, I haven't been to this specific property, but I have passed through Ithaca Bakery's Triphammer Mall location and I liked its atmosphere. Very cozy, seeing as it's tucked away into a corner of the mall. The restaurant is wide and spacious with a nice flow around the open air bakery area through which you can see many baked goods, loaves, and pastries to nibble on. I'm assuming it'd be pretty similar here. Food Review -- If you take one look at the picture I've posted with this review, you'll know why Ithaca Bakery is getting a 5-star review in the Food Category. Seriously, would you look at that sandwich? The best part is, it tasted even better than it looked. The West Willow BBQ was perfect, not too much sauce, and the mountain of pulled pork dwarfed the coleslaw - in my opinion, that's how every pulled pork sandwich should be made. Each bite was a juicy, sweet & salty, savory piece of heaven. In short, this sandwich was something from God's own lunch menu. Service Review -- Ithaca Bakery actually delivers for FREE. Crazy, huh? As long as you order between 11am - 2pm, they'll deliver straight to your door Monday through Friday. The delivery woman was very nice, but I had one hiccup. I had scheduled my delivery through their website for the 12:30pm-1pm time frame (you can choose) but they arrived at 11:30am...what if I hadn't been home? Oh well, I wasn't hungry yet so I had to wait and reheat the burger when lunch hour came around. Overall Impression -- Besides the fact that my food arrived an hour early (which seems like an odd complaint), the experience was great. Being sick, it was a great change not to be cooking and to have a ready-made meal. I'm looking forward to dining on-site in the future and I already know what I'm ordering when I get there!
My husband and I were passing through Ithaca and stopped here for a quick bite. Since it was in the AM we went for breakfast sandwiches, both of which had eggs in them. The eggs tasted very, very "off" to me, and I noticed there was no natural white and yellow marbling that you would find in true scrambled eggs. I've worked in food service and quickly realized the eggs were not true eggs but likely egg-like substance that comes from a carton, often from a big food service company. To give Ithaca bakery a benefit of a doubt I asked one of the staff members where the eggs were from, and he confirmed that they were from a carton, purchased from Sysco. For a place that seems to draw most of its customers in with its use of "local" and "farm to bakery" type foods, I was surprised to discover such low, low food quality among its products.  It seems sneaky, and I wanted future potential customers to realize what they are getting when they order meals with eggs at Ithica bakery. BTW, companies like sysco also sell batter and dough for baked goods. It might be worth checking if they truly make other products like cookies from scratch, or if those come in some form from an larger food company.
Try not to gag as a woman who just wrapped a grueling Bikram session wanders about the bakery air drying herself while looking for oolong. I know the town is Earthy and environmentally friendly and blah-blah-blah, but when did ignoring personal hygiene fall into that bucket? I suppose one bad apple has spoiled the bunch for me here. There are a lot of options, I suppose, but grab 'em and hit the road.
This was a quick pit stop for us. It was busy as it was a holiday. I was overwhelmed by the menu. I ordered J's Meal on gluten-free bread. It was good but the bagel sandwiches coming out looked better. I would get something different next time. I tried a white chocolate raspberry scone. It was good but I could tell they didn't make it that same morning. Take some time with the menu. I would come back but wouldn't get the same thing. I would give 3 stars except they do support local farms so I'm giving it 4.
what a wonderful place! whether you want to snack or stuff it's perfect. The chopped liver is to die for. and just a huge selection of different types of food from hot plates to soup and sandwiches. enormous selection, easy quick payment and you can shop for chutney etc for home. great bakery, try the croissant. big and buttery. if you are in Ithaca avoid the many fancy and expensive places and try here. you won't regret it. if you can afford it take home some of their wonderful smoked salmon.
