It's true, hipsters gravitate to this bar. However, the excellent bartenders, good drinks and great atmosphere out way a few douchey people. Besides, the more you're buzzed, the less you'll notice the hipster..
What a bunch of pretentious hipster A-holes!! I love craft beer but i can do without all the smug liberal  douche bags! F*** You green onion F*** You
What a great find! I suppose it was inevitable that we'd end up here one day but I still am so proud of myself for sniffing this place out. I drove by one day and suspected it was a bar. So two days later I returned with my husband in tow. What a charming bar! The craft beer selection is fantastic and appears to change regularly. We stopped in during the early evening and enjoyed a pint and have since returned with friends visiting from out of town. I definitely see myself turning into a regular at the Green Onion.
Nice selection of taps and bottles.  Helpful and friendly bartender.  Open until 2am every night.  Recommended.
South Utica bar with great bartenders and a regular casual bohemian crowd. There is an eclectic array of beers on tap, which is not always a good thing if you don't want coffee, apricots, chocolate etc flavored beer.
Great draft and bottle selection, great service and great prices.  Such a rustic looking bar and the locals were friendly and warm to this outsider.
Cosy and nice.  Good selection of brew
cute little place, very easy-going and laid-back, great beers and cheap cocktails. also really nice bar tenders. i will definitely be back soon!
