I don't understand the low rating. I went there today and the mal was great. No higher end brand name here, but you can find all of the normal stores. H&M, forever 21, bare escentual, american eagle, hollister, abercrombie, old navy, victoria secret, etc. They also have target, macy's and best buy here. The mal was packed with people. I even find a place selling bubble tea. SCORE!! damn, I thought I have to live without bubble tea for 2 weeks due to this stupid business trip to Fishkill. Oh, I had a security coming over and asked if I am over 18. She even asked to check my ID. I thought that was weird. Since when you can't go to the mal by yourself on a saturday afternoon if you are under 18?? However, I'll take that as I'm looking younger than I really am, so that was flattering. LOL.
The Galleria is your typical american mall. Teeming with teenage hormones, the smell of popcorn and mysterious cleaning products, it's not anything unusual. I like it better than the Kingston mall, if only because they happen to have stores I like better. But I'm rarely in this part of Dutchess County, and if I am I make it count. Meaning, I spend my entire day at the mall making me never want to come back again. Well, that may be a bit drastic; maybe just for six months. You get the idea. The stores change fairly often although the anchor stores like JCPenney's and Macy's have stuck around. Recently they've added a Sephora which is something I've been looking forward to having nearby. Other than my yearly Christmas shopping, I don't come here much. Gotta avoid the teenage angst!
Although I live a comfortable 45 minute drive from this mall (which makes the travel to it feel like too much), I occasionally visit this mall.  It's got lots of stores.  From the high-end Best Buy to the Target department store, it's all there.  Take a look around. Prior to this mall, I had never seen a Nathans nor a Wendy's in a mall location.  But they got them here.  Yes, these locations are a bit pricier than their outside competitors, but I can live with that, if I'm only around once every six or so months.
The mall is dying, all the cool stores are gone. Its turning into the south hills mall, which is like DEAD. they took out the only bookstore i like going to . I dont want to go to borders lol Meh im very disappointed and with the snow making the parking lot collapse, that could have been prevented
A solid mall, except I hate the constant kid parties that seem to be going on. I feel like at any given moment, Banana Republic is going to close here because the place is always empty. But hey, until they do, I like the open store!
White trash, curfew-cheating 16 year old burn out heaven.  The good stores moved out years ago, leaving a lone Baby Gap and Best Buy.  Just awful.
I love this mall so many things to look at and buy! Sometimes a little expensive but it is very good place to get gifts for u and urself. I wish the mall was a bit bigger and a little cheaper but that's New York anyway and the economy.
Yes I agree, better than Crystal Run, but really, not a good mall at all. So much better to drive to Danbury or the shopping mecca - Garden State Plaza.  The mall has very few good stores. I will probably never go again, it was that bad.
This isn't my favorite mall but it beats the Jefferson Valley Mall which is the mall closest to my house. I shop here because I love all the stores along Rt 9, so I usually hit this mall on the way back down from home goods! I wish they had a Gymboree, Pottery Barn kids and kept Kirklands. I love the Awesome Country store because its different... Reminds me of Le Gourmet Chef that used to be in the Palisades Mall. Happy Shopping!
I liked the Galleria a lot better in its heyday, when it had a more interesting variety of stores. I think Penney's is the only original anchor left.  These days, there's very little to distinguish it from other malls, particularly Pyramid owned ones. Except for the much-needed add of Target, unless there's something I need from a particular store, or if I'm driving by anyway, I don't have a lot of reason to go.
Decent mall. This was the go-to place whenever we wanted to go clothes shopping without having to drive an hour to Palisades Mall. It's fairly big and has all the stores I could ever need. It's clean, good amount of parking spaces, security, etc. My favorite parts of this mall include the GIANT Target/Best Buy/Old Navy/H&M and the food court. We usually enter through the Target (which is bad because then we'll buy everything in there first before we even get to one store in the mall. The Old Navy is pretty awesome too. They just have everything. As for the food court, they have a nice big space with plenty of seats. As for the food there's Wendy's, Nathan's 2 chinese food places, pretzel place, Taco Bell, etc. It's definitely nice to have someplace to sit after you've shopped till you've dropped. (Literally.) They sometimes have fun events going on during the mall like fundraisers or small concerts. If you're around, check this place out.
Great Mall
While other people seem to hate this place, I find it acceptable.  This place has all the major stores: Sears, Macy's, JC Penny, Target, Best Buy, A&E, Aeropotale, Abercrombie, H&M, Forever 21, Hollister, Victoria's Secret, The Body Shop, The Bath and Body Shop, Brookstone, DSW, Express, LOFT, Old Navy, New York and Company, Banana Republic, Sephora, Aldo, Payless Shoes, and Hot Topic.   I am not perticularly aware of all the good stores gone out of the mall but to me they have everything we need.  Somebody said there is no bookstore or Apple.  This is located in Poughkeepsie= definitely not a big city. So the best bet is you won't find an Apple store in Poughkeepsie.  There is Bern's and Nobles on the same street.   To me, the dining option is lacking.  There are only 2 restaurants: Ruby Tuesday and Melting Pot and the rest is food court.  They are dining options outside the mall on the same street.  They have a movie theater inside the mall too.   I think this is the best we are gonna get in Dutchess and Orange county.
The only joy I find in this place when I was little was going up and down the elevator. The one story Kingston Mall seems more reasonable to go to than waste gas for the trip to come all the way here.
I heard lots of people hate it here. It's actually not so bad at all. I wish they had a apple store and bookstores like high scale malls. Also their food cort is pretty good but I wish they would have more restaraunt a in this place but it's decent because there's tons of other restaurants along rt.9 the only restaurants the galleria has besides the food court restaurants is Ruby Tuesdays and The Melting Pot. I've grew up here for most of my life and seen some pretty good stores come and go. I do notice galleria is bigger than most malls around. They have a really nice movie theatre you should try here.
Being a Dutchess County resident for the majority of my life, I've experienced this mall as a toddler, pre-teen, teenager and adult. I've seen this mall go from grunge to an empire--kicking the South Hills mall repeatedly to the curb until there was nothing left except Dollar Tuesdays and chain stores not good enough for 2001 South Road. After living in Albany for three years, I realized that the Poughkeepsie Galleria is always last to get "new" stores. For example, it took the Galleria at least 2 1/2 years to get a Teavana after the Crossgates (Albany) mall did. I know it doesn't seem like a big deal but it should to corporate. Right now, the Galleria is set to get a "Francesca's Collections" which has been at the Crossgates mall for at least 6+ months already. Maybe they're stepping up their game but either way, I don't see the point of going to this mall unless you live in the area. There's no reason to go out of your way to go there. The Galleria has every type of store you'd expect...unless you're expecting a bookstore, Apple store, Williams and Sonoma, Deb, Pottery Barn, etc. (Hint hint: Step up your game, Galleria! I know you can do it!)
Depending on your age and taste, this mall will either make it or break it for you. As a 19 year old female, I find this mall disappointing, especially after the recent closure of Aerie. The mall itself is kind of dirty and lacking in appearance. The selection of stores is pretty standard. Good points include Target, Macy's, Forever 21, H&M, Old Navy, Best Buy, Sear's, Dick's, DSW, JC Penney, and the movie theater. However, a lot of the other stores are pretty small compared to other malls and have limited selection (Victoria's Secret, American Eagle, PacSun, Hollister, etc.) A large number of stores will open for a short time (2-3 months) and then close down. There are a lot of no-name stores as well. As for the food selection, it's nothing special at all. The food court includes Wendy's, Taco Bell, Nathan's, a pizzeria, a deli, Mr. Smoothie, and three Asian restaurants (why they need 3 different Asian places beats me). The only sit-down restaurants are Melting Pot (which is great) and Ruby Tuesday. The food highlight is probably the new Beach Berry frozen yogurt station. In general, I only come here if I need a specific item or need to make a quick mall trip. Otherwise, I would much rather just take the ride to Danbury or the Palisades.
I'm not only a foodie, but a shopping-addict as well. I only go here because it's the only shopping center for 40 miles (at least). They don't have an Apple store OR a book store. Seriously? What kind of customers is this place trying to appeal to? Being the only mall within a reasonable distance to the Culinary Institute of America, Marist, Vassar, and Bard even... you would think that they would put in an Apple store (I don't know how many times I've had to drive back to Albany to pick up something for my computer or have it looked at) rather than remodel their H&M store. Don't get me wrong, I love clothes and stores like H&M and Forever 21, but it's not a necessity. We need books, technological aid with our gadgets and electronics, and a target that ISN'T attached to a hype-y shopping mall.
A decent mall with decent stores. I don't know why people are saying all the good stores have moved, but when it fact the corporations of these stores filed for bankruptcy causing their demised when they weren't making their goals in profits to stay a float .
I went in here the other day because I needed to go to Hallmark and pick up a card for my grandmother's birthday.  Prior to this visit, I couldn't tell you the last time I was in this place. When I was a kid/teenager, my parents would venture across the river to this mall, because they felt it was of a better quality and offered a better shopping experience than the Galleria at Crystal Run.  My family did major Christmas shopping here every year; I bought my junior prom dress at this place.  It was definitely a cut far above the South Hills Mall, which was fairing poorly when I was a kid, and has since died and been torn down. But that was then.  While the Poughkeepsie Galleria still boasts slightly better stores than Crystal Run - for example, they have an Abercrombie, which Crystal Run could never imagine in its wildest dreams - let us not forget that many of the far superior stores have long since moved out.  And yes, they no longer have a bookstore.  You know that a mall is going downhill when it gets rid of its bookstore, because all decent malls have one.  So: the bookstore moved out and Forever 21 moved in, and every high school student in Dutchess County converges on that place like moths to a flame.   Yeech.  Stay away from POK Galleria, future shoppers.  Stay away!
This might be the only one-star I've ever given to a place and desperately to give it more. This place used to be the mecca of the Dutchess County (at least from a teenage prospective). In my opinion, ever since the bookstore was taken out the place lost all appeal. It's dirty, usually pretty dead, and stores are closing and new ones are opening constantly so it's really sad and obvious it will probably be gone within the next five years. The only reason I'll go here (and it's not for a movie) is to go Christmas shopping and thank goodness that's FAR OFF.
