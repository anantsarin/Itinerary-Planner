Love this place!  Great for kid fiction!  We run a tab behind the register with our credits.  We bring in the old, get credit and take out the new.  We love it!

If you live locally, you can stretch your purchase dollars here by taking advantage of their return-for-credit policy. If you are just passing through, you'll pay half the cover price for everything. Bookworm has an impressive selection of mostly paperback books, extremely well organized. Certain categories of books are extensive, and I mean really extensive. One thing I did like which I haven't seen elsewhere is a small selection of "Notes" as little arrows pointing toward selections by more popular writers. That not only helps you find them, but it gives you an idea of how far you've gone through the alphabet as you pass each aisle. I thought that was a nice touch. If you're into niches such as Harlequins, science fiction, mysteries, etc., you're sure to find an interesting selection.

I love the smell of books. Old books especially.  There's something special about picking up a story with dogeared pages, well worn with love.  That's why I love the Bookworm. The Bookworm is one of only a handful of used book stores in Dutchess County.  Or who knows - it may be the only one?  Its certainly the only once I patron.  They offer "pre-loved" books for 50% of the original publishers price.  On trade in, they offer store credit for 25% of the publishers price. The collection isn't immense - but its big enough that while you may not find what you came for, you will always leave with something.  Or, if your like me, you'll leave with about 5 somethings. There's pretty good turnover, so the selection is always fresh. My only caveat?  They close early (by 5 most nights) and are closed on Sundays.  So for all those 9-5ers, its not always the most convenient place to visit.   Bookworm, hear my cry! Stay open later for all us poor suckers!

I love the concept of recycling books, and the Bookworm is a great way to do that.  The books are affordable and there is a good selection. The only detractor is the staff.  I found the older woman who worked there (possibly the owner???) to be rude and impatient.  I was there for an hour, purchased 14 books, and only asked one question, which was something like, "Can you point me in the direction of the children's book section?"  This request completely exasperated her.  When I checked out my purchases, she was equally flustered and seemed completely annoyed with the process. Overall, this establishment offers a great service.  I think the customer service can be improved upon.

Love the variety of books. I also love that it's kind of green to trade your old books for credit towards other used books. The kids really like being able to get best sellers for a fraction of the cost. Plus the staff is very knowledgable.

I love this place. Great used book store. And there aren't that many around us. It actually may be the only one near by?

For those in the market for used paperback mysteries/sci fi / adventure / romance this is a great store.  The selection is actually overwhelming with many many titles filed neatly in genre/alphabetical order in shelf after shelf.  Everything is half off the cover price (+25). My wife and I bought 20 books for less than $4 a book.  The staff is friendly and the ambiance cozy - I could have spent many more hours here but with so many books at home waiting to be read I could not imagine bringing even more home.  Can't wait to go back
