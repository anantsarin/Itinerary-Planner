Shear Perfection is brand new! The place is completely redone and very nice! I had Crystal highlight my hair. She took me from dark brown dyed hair to weaved highlighted hair. She was great!!! I'd definitely go back, but only if she's available. I think the salon is brand new so the stylists are taking new clients. They had a beautiful room for pedicures too.
I had Crystal too and she was awesome. Gave me a wax, cut my hair, and dyed it. I couldn't be happier! I even took a stack of her business cards on my way out to give to friends. The salon is new and on the corner of 57 and John Glenn.
