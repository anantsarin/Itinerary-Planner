I cannot comment on deep tissue, shiatsu or any other full body massages offered here, as I go only for the reflexology (Chinese Foot Massage.) Â I love getting a good foot massage as it relaxes me and leaves me feeling as invigorated as a body massage does. Their 1 hour foot massage is a bit pricier than what I pay for the same service in NYC's or San Francisco's Chinatown areas - but the service is good and it's a really lovely facility - very clean and pleasant. I've tried regular full body massages at several other legitimate Chinese spas when traveling and have generally found that good local CMTs do a better job. It may be partly training and partly language barrier. But I like this place and will continue to go there for the foot massages when I'm able to.
The massage therapist was very nice and the spa was nice and clean, but the massage itself was subpar. I was not asked about my problem areas, or areas I wanted worked on. My #1 problem with this spa is that they are over priced. I paid $135 for 1 1/2 massage +tip. Outrageous! I needed a massage bad, and it was the only place with an opening. But I will never go back.
