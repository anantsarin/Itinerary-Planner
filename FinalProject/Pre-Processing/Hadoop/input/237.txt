This is one of the most exquisite Gurudwaras I have ever been to till date. Though this Gurudwara Sahib is quite far off from my home but I have been here quite a number of times. This is one of the most sought after Sikh Temples chosen to perform the Sikh weddings.I have attended a number of weddings here. This temple has the perfect setting for traditional Sikh marriage. The soothing white colour of the building with lush green background is really awesome. This particular Gurudwara Sahib is huge. When I say huge, it is really big. Built over 15 acres of land in the expensive Nassau County, the main building spans across 30,000 sq ft and it has 20 rooms and 3 big halls. It was formed by the Sikhs residing in the Long Island when they felt there is a need of a larger facility in the neighborhood. They place attracts an average weekly congregation of 200 families from the surrounding area.It is a place where weekly and wekeend services are organised. Since in SIkhism there are no idols, statues, or religious pictures in a gurdwara,the prayer session revolves around the holy book and the eternal Sikh Guru, the Guru Granth Sahib.The Sikhs hold high respect for the teachings and commandments laid down in the Guru Granth Sahib and treat it as living god.. They normally have Diwans(Prayer sessions) on Fridays and Sundays. The prayer session is followed by the Langar(Free food, free community kitchen) in the hall located downstairs. They serve really awesome food. People from all faiths and religions are always welcomed here. I am glad I was able to save this place for my 400th Review!!!
