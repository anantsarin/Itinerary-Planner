I went here with my fiancé . The music they had was awesome ( lots of rock) . Dancers were all friendly and pretty . Instead of having just poles , they also had swing in shape of a ring and fog machines on each side which was pretty cool. ...... All in all, it was quite an experience .
I'm not sure if it is the right place when we went to Daytona Beach. I was taken to a strip club where I just have $1 and a girl shake her boobs on my face. They were pretty hot girls...Gorgeous Girls...Yup
OK way much better on a Friday night was packed , a variety of pretty girls It was pretty fun night!!!!!
this place has gone under within the last 6months.....low class, drama,sexist and rasist...
One of the better Daytona strip joints. Ladies are on the sexier side and when it's bike week or one of those event going on there are girls EVERYWHERE. One time I racked up a dance tab way over what I had on me cause I was trashed and they just let me leave. Pretty cool. Girls like to break the rules also!
My friends and I went here about a year ago and it was awesome.. The girls there are awesome and they are all gorgeous girls... Just one suggestion to the guys.. don't f@@# with them because the bouncers will kick you out.. LOL
Lollipops reminds me of a sports bar but with girls dancing on a small stage. Music ehh ok. Drinks regular priced, girls ok I wouldn't use gorgeous or beautiful.  They have pool tables so thats pretty nice.  It's really just a sports bar to me.  Wasn't a big fan.
