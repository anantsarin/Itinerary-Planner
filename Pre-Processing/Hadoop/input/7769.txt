Our family really likes kohls which is a cross btween jc pennys and belks Good quality items Excellent servicev(usually) 1 star taken away for their 30% off sales Just give the best price and skip the coupon gimmick
Offal experience bad judgement and so disrespectful. Ive been a long times Kohls customer and I can believe how they acted in that store. No one know anything or cared about my purchase. It was rang up incorrectly and I had to go back to customer service and wait in a 20 min line. Finally some one comes off break chewing food and coughing all over my items. Sickening and tacky.
logos is a fun inexpensive store where u never walk out empty handed. The extrea dollars after $50.09 purchas r excellent
Really like Kohls in The Villages. However I find prices to be on the high side, particularly in the household dept. and when the 10, 20, & 30% coupons are available.
What great customer service!  With tougher times, I find I am shopping on a tighter budget!  I actually received a Kohls credit card for all the advantages that come with it!  Also, the customer service is wonderful as so many stores have cut back on service and you can hardly find anyone to assist you let alone ask if there is something they can do for you to make your shopping experience any better.  Check out the prices as they are very competitive especially when you use their coupons!  We are enjoying our "anti gravity lounge chairs" this week-end  that we bought on sale, one for a good price and the other was so inexpensive with all the coupons and discounts! Thanks Kohls, my back needed that!
Ehhh...maybe I missed the boat here...but it seems to me this is nothing more than another vacuous retailer - with minimal staff and stocked full of Made In China goods.  :O(
Kohls in The Villages is probably the best Kohls I have been into. They always have a great selection of Women's Clothes and Household items.
Good location, well stocked, friendly associates, neat & clean. I enjoy shopping here.
