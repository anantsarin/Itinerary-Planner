I hate shoes. I hate shoe stores. I hate shopping for shoes. I hate having shoes on my feet. But dammit, summer is here, and I needed a pair of sandals. The only trouble is that I've never worn sandals before. For over ten years it's been flip flops until it snows. And then flip flops after the first thaw. And I wanted to find some sandals that were just like flip flops. They needed to be waterproof and let my toes fly free. But they also needed to offer better support, because I'm getting old and my beloved flip flops were no longer cutting it. Oh, and did I mention that I'm almost impossible to fit? My feet are huge weighing in at size thirteen, and thank to my maternal-grandfather I've inherited his genetic mutation of a hammer toe on my left foot. The morning I walked into Track N Trail I was desperate. I had already been to a few other stores in the mall, and they were my last hope. There was one lone clerk manning the store, and he worked tirelessly to get me into a pair of something called Chaco's. And by tirelessly, I mean that we must have tried on over a dozen different brands and styles of sandals until we found one that worked. Now, I know some people are happy to buy their shoes on Zappos.com. That's what people were advising me. But I needed a bit more hand holding than that. And I can assure you had I not had the guidance and support of an actual human being that morning, I never would have found my way to this particular pair of foot ware. Which I have to say, I'm starting to really love. Yes, they are crazy expensive for what amounts to a piece of rubber strapped to my foot with some nylon. But they are designed or approved by foot doctors, and they are everything I want in a flip flop, but in the form of a sandal. Thank you Track N Trail. I hope this pair of sandals lasts me for a million years so I never have to go shoe shopping again. But if I do, I'm coming here first.
