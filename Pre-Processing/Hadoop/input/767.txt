This is one of my favorite places in Buffalo. It's a unique place filled with little shops and food vendors from around the world. Everyone is friendly and patient. The sushi place has a customer loyalty card and the bubble tea is good. I've eaten the Thai food and the sushi and enjoyed both. The Thai food I ordered was a bit spicy. Make sure you don't park in the Rite Aid lot! There is a lot behind the building off of West Ferry. It's a pedestrian friendly neighborhood and I encourage taking a walk through the West Side to get here.
"Exotic Buffalo" seems like an oxymoron, but West Side Bazaar proves that it simply is not. Going into the building made me feel like I was suddenly back in Asia. The set up of the bazaar is simply what I was accustomed to at home. The colors made me smile and excited to browse through everything. Burmese, Thai, and Senegalese wares are available and they are beautiful. West Side Bazaar also has a food court where one can chose from Thai, Burmese, Japanese, Sudanese, and Ethiopian foods. I happen to be a fan of the mentioned cuisines so of course this just made me even more of a fan. This is a really cool place to check out if you were in Buffalo.
This is a really cool place. Each window is a cultural wonderland for food. The Thai and Burmese are my favorite. I would give more stars if it were not for getting an Ethiopian platter in which the chicken was covered in some kind of fuzz or hair. I couldn't eat anymore once I noticed it and I should have told them but I didn't. I've had the Ethiopian food once before and it was good. Maybe it was just an anomaly but it is unacceptable. Fuzz/hair in food is a big No No.   The Burmese spring rolls are huge, fresh and delicious.   I haven't had a bad Thai meal. The prices are low and they pack the plates with food. I haven't had any of the desserts because they seem a little generic, and I doubt I ever will. If you enjoy ethnic foods, this is a one-stop shop for you.
A multicultural riot for your senses. Vendors and food from Senegal, Burma, Peru, Rwanda, Ethiopia &c. Lovely jewelrey, cloth, wood carvings never before seen under one roof in Buffalo. Shopping to the left, food stalls to the right. And oh, the food.
Someone recently referred to this place as the "West Side Bizarre." I thought that was hilarious, but not as hilarious as a clown that accidentally makes all young children cry while attempting to make them laugh. If you haven't been here, and you live in Buffalo, and you are even remotely cultured and enjoy atypical, exotic experiences, then you are really, really, really, really, really, really, really missing out. This place is amaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaazing. When I pulled up, I thought to myself... nah... this is going to be a let down, isn't it? I mean it had all the makings of a let down. People talked it up as if it were the WSM in CLE or Pike's Place, as if it were Quincy Market in the BOS or STL market in T-Dot, as if it were the RTM in PHI or the C-Bus market. See, I know my market terminologies, yo. I mean it just looked like a charity shop from the outside, and a rather small one at that. Surely this couldn't be as good as all it's cracked up to be? Well yes it very well could be and don't call me Shirley. Inside, are all these stalls (by all these, I mean maybe 8 tops) with all these cool things on sale from various faraway cultures around the world (South American, African, Asian and Aboriginal, only I lied about the Aboriginal). But that's only the half of it. The other half (the half of the Bazaar not near the door) is where s*** gets really good. Because oh my goodness, it's a bunch of exotic foods, the likes of which you will be hard pressed to find in any American city, let alone Italian Irish American German B-Lo Ny. So you've got Ethiopian, Thai, Burmese, Japanese (Crepes from Japan!), Soul Food (which is served by South Sudanese folks along with fresh fruit drinks and South Sudanese specialties), and Peruvian (although the Peruvian isn't around at the moment). I may be missing a few of these. So far I've only tried the fruit drink from the Sudanese, and a sample platter of the Ethiopian, but my goodness... it was (a) one of the best fruit drinks I have ever had... and I know my fruit drinks... Ashker's eat your heart out... and (b) the best Ethiopian food I've ever had, bar none. It's utterly amazing. Every dish on the sample platter is divine. You must get it. So run, do not walk, to Grant Street... bypass La Nova and all your old haunts, you ghost, you... and get inside the WSB and GSF* and WID** and then TML***. TMI? Or TMA****? *Get Some Food **Wolf It Down (like LDC*****) ***Thank Me Later ****Too Much Acronyms****** *****Leonardo CiCaprio ******Grammatically speaking, should be Too Many rather than Too Much, but I wanted to parody TMI.
I am so glad this place exists! I have heard such great things about it, particularly from a friend who wrote a very thorough article about what it has to offer (among other places in Buffalo). I am a big proponent of supporting small businesses and up-and-coming entrepreneurs, so what better way than to eat my way through various countries all in one marketplace? Now I definitely plan to return and sample more food, but I managed to stuff myself senseless with some phenomenal Burmese vegetable noodle (complete with side cucumber/chili sauce salad and a broth soup), Spring rolls, an Ethiopian platter with vegetables/meat, hot Ethiopian coffee, and a mango bubble tea to top it off!! Oh, and I had some baklava dessert too. All of that came to under $25. All of it was delicious with huge portions. These guys were all so nice, friendly, helpful and make some insanely good food. This is a great place to get some lovely gifts and get some Henna art done if you so incline! Pure Peru wasn't operating (they will return at the end of the month), so I can't wait to go back and eat more! I'm so impressed with this place, and am happy it has done so well and with well-deserved praise :)
This is such a beautiful and special place, ideally located near Buffalo State College off of Grant Street. I unexpectedly wandered into this gem with a friend thinking it was actually a store. I was surprised to find that it was a market and also a platform for independent cuisine stands: Ethiopian, Burmese and Peruvian to name a few types of food they offer. All of the vendors employed at each stand were so pleasant and helpful while the vibe was overall very casual. In addition to the food there is also a clothing/beauty product/henna tattoo/novelty section on the opposite side of the bazaar. This is a great place to people watch as this establishment attracts a plethora of different characters. I didn't get too adventurous and opted for some samosas but the Ethiopian and Burmese dishes are on my next "to review" list. I'm clearly a fan now. xx
I walked in expecting it to look "basementy" but it was very clean and comfortable inside. We did have to bus our own table to get a clean one so that was kind of annoying. I was really disappointed that the Peruvian Vendor isn't currently there. I tried some of her food at a prior Yelp event and I want more! I ordered some Ethyopian food. The menu wasn't very descriptive so I just kind of picked something. It was lamb and it was good (for only 6 bucks). My friend ordered Thai food and their ordering system was very confusing. There was a teenage girl standing outside the window taking orders. However, it wasn't really evident that was her job. She just stood there like she was in line and eventually my friend figured out what was going on and ordered. She waited a very long time for her order of Pad Thai - like 30 minutes. We did have some delicious drinks from the bubble tea lady while we waited. The whole thing was an interesting experience and I would like to try it again sometime.
I am very, very torn. This IS actually a cool place. Some of us got Ethiopian food (in particular, ox tail) and they all really enjoyed it. However, I had Thai and it was absolutely AWFUL - just tasted like grease. Probably the worst "Thai" food I've ever had. Only ate it b/c I was starved after a 45 minute wait (we were not notified of this long a wait time after ordering and some of us were able to cancel, but lucky me couldn't).  I heard another man who got what I ate complain to the clerk regarding the complete lack of flavor. Place was also dirty (trash piled high). Hopefully better infrastructure is built, because it has so much potential!
Great place for a cheap and delish lunch. Plates around $7 for tons of food with lots of flavor that comes out quick. I saw Thai, South Sudanese, Burmese, and Ethiopian. Nomz! Highly recommended. Can't wait to go back and try something else.
Buffalo, count yourself lucky to have this place. 4 food stations, each one better than the next, with crazy variety and insane prices. I could seriously eat nothing else for a year or so. So far, the best bet has been the Burmese Shan noodle soup. The pad Thai was also great.
This place is awesome! I went for lunch yesterday and ended up doing a little shopping as well. I bought earrings and two scarves and ended up spending less than $10. Everything was very affordable. For lunch I tried the Burmese stand and had their special of the day. It was a rice noodle bowl with quail eggs, tofu, meatballs, veggies, and siracha. It was SO good. You can't really tell from the picture but the serving was huge and I ended up eating most of it. I also got a veggie spring roll which was good but I would try a meat one next time. I then split a Japanese crepe for dessert. We ordered a crepe with Nutella, bananas, and whipped cream but received a crepe with strawberry jam, nutella, strawberries, and whipped cream instead. We didn't complain at all though-the crepe was amazing. I'll chalk up the mix to our language differences. All in all I can't wait to go back. This hidden gem is affordable, delicious, unique, and the perfect lunch spot. As an AmeriCorps member I wish I could give this another star for the AmeriCorps alum director!
With the food bazaar opening up here, this is one of the most unique and culturally diverse "food courts" in the Buffalo area now. Calling it a food court is a disservice though, since it conjures up images of malls and oftentimes crappy and inauthentic food. This is the real deal. The West Side Bazaar is an entrepreneurial "Incubator" for refugees and talented multi-cultural individuals. It started out as a place for entrepreneurs to sell goods from various countries and just recently evolved to serve up ethnic delicacies from Burma, Ethiopia, Peru, Thai and other places. You'll find some of the best brewed Ethiopian coffee here from Abyssinia and wonderful sushi from Rakhapura Mutee. Pure Peru, despite having their own store, also serves up food here. I've only tried the Abyssinia sushi so far...and wow! It's great. I can't wait to try other food. So happy to have a place like this in Buffalo. If you haven't had a chance to try it out yet, what are you waiting for?!
I'M IN LOVE, I'M IN LOVE, AND I DON'T CARE WHO KNOWS IT. Wow. Thanks to everyone for such a great recommendation! My friend and I went here for lunch today, and with not much money, we were able to have a great experience. I got vegetable spring rolls and the coconut chicken soup from the Burmese stand. My friend ordered American and spicy tuna rolls, a chicken samosa, and he treated me to Ethiopian coffee. Not a complaint about anything. The spring rolls are big-you get two for $5 and they come with a peanut and a sweet chili sauce. So refreshing, you'll feel like a million bucks. At first I didn't realize the coconut chicken soup comes with sliced eggs, but it makes complete sense when you eat it. I can't rave enough about how flavorful and delicious it is, and the portion is BIG for $5. My friend paid $1.50 for the chicken samosa and it was GOOD. Heavy, delicious, filling, flavorful. The American roll is delicious with crunchy onions for texture and a nice little spicy kick. The woman from the sushi stand gives out a little rewards card and if you've purchased 6 rolls, you'll get the 7th for free. The Ethiopian coffee is the best coffee I've ever had. I like my coffee strong and bold and this certainly did not disappoint. Plus, it came in these fancy tea cups with little gems. I felt like a princess, or a welcome guest of the woman who served it. Everything was above reproach. I even got a nice pair of dangly earrings on my way out. This is my new favorite place!
I was excited to stop in for lunch and find the West Side Bazaar teeming with diners--from immigrants in colorful garb, to a group of guys who looked like they were on break from a construction job, to a table of folks in nice office attire. After walking through two two aisles of boutique-style vendors, offering everything from coffee beans to gorgeous sarongs and dashikis, you come to what makes this place extra-special: the international food court. From small window counters off the seating area, you can select freshly prepared items from a variety of culinary traditions. Full menus are offered at each of the Thai, Burmese, Peruvian, and Ethiopian window. As you'd expect from traditions that are less meat-intensive than our own, there are plenty of VEGETARIAN options, including many dishes served with a chicken/tofu option. (And, yes, there are plenty of meat options for the omnivores among us.) I ordered from the Peruvian window, opting for a delicious dish featuring savory rice, potatoes, roasted onions and tomatoes, plus tofu ($9). Loved it! I wasn't as crazy about the veggie tamale--but that was my own fault; I didn't realize Peruvian tamales are traditionally served with a vinegar-based marinade, which was too sharp for my taste. I also ordered the Chicha Morada, a blue corn drink with more antioxidants than found in blueberries. For $2, the big, cold glass was sweet and tasty. My lunch companion shared her order of the veggie sampler from the Ethiopian window ($9) and every one of the six or seven dishes served was delicious. She also tried the veggie summer rolls from the Thai window. For $5, she got two huge rolls with peanut and sweet chili dipping sauces. Fresh and delicious! In short, we had a great experience and will be back.
For those of you who have not had the pleasurable experience of going to the Westside Bazaar, it is a hodgepodge of local retailers selling their wears in a shared retail spot that includes a little food court with seating that is reminiscent of a high school cafeteria. With that said, it is what it is. This is not a place you go for atmosphere, ambiance or to impress a first date. You go there because there are 4 or 5 different food vendors who are mostly native to the style of food they're cooking. From what I can remember there was Ethiopian, Thai, Burmese and Peruvian, oh, and a dessert window. Simply put, great authentic ethnic food, cheap. I have only tried the ceviche from the Peruvian kitchen, it was fantastic, but, everything else coming out looked and smelled great. Another shining star here is Koop's Kitchen, he makes an assortment of BBQ/hot sauces, mustards and dry rubs. I had a great conversation with Koop about how him and his grandson came up with the name of one of his sauces, 'the sniper.' He was a very charming and inviting guy to talk to. I could see that he has a true fire for stinging and tantalizing your tastebuds with his incendiary sauces. Also he had a ton of free samples but, that may have only been for the grand opening. There are also a myriad of things to peruse there as well, clothes, jewelry, little carvings and other assorted curios. But, the food, the food is why I will continue to go there. This spot is the definition of a 'Diamond in the Rough'. So set aside the fears you have of that neighborhood, park at the Rite Aid across the street and enjoy.
Where else in Buffalo can you find food from Peru, Ethiopia, Burma and Thailand (I'm sure I'm missing someone), all under one roof? You order at each stand's window or counter, then seat yourself at one of the nearby tables. The cooks will let you know when your meal is ready. Need to pick up a gift while you grab a cookie and a cup of coffee? You can visit the vendors' stalls, selecting from a variety of artwork, crafts and clothing.
The peruvian pork sandwich on a week roll is outstanding!
Jolie the Chinese dumpling lady is gone, available only at Horsefeathers now. BUT there is Lao bubble tea, Peruvian, Burmese sushi, traditional Burmese and a new Ethiopian restaurant so now Buffalo has four places to eat Ethiopian! Rumor has it that Thai is coming. Shop the market for Moroccan leather, Burmese embroidered shirts and jewelry and crafts from Africa.
First time here at the WSB and I was impressed. Authentic to say the least with the merchandise and especially the food. Tried Ethiopian for the first time and it was ok, prolly wont have it again. The "bread" kinda threw me, a texture thing I guess. It reminded me of eating memory foam. Good visit though, glad I stopped in.
This is a fairly small space set up and run by a local non-profit (WEDI) to help small business owners from the community get started. A few of the vendors sell clothing and other interesting items and the remaining vendors prepare some incredible food out of a shared kitchen. Try all of them. Seriously. You won't get this combination of variety, quality, and affordability anywhere else. A bonus benefit is the knowledge that you're helping someone restart their life here in the US.
Chinese dumplings.   Cookies and coffee.   Koops kitchen hot sauces.   Indian clothes, scarves and jewelry.   Moroccan store.   Ethiopian food. This is not a complete list of what's available at the newly opened "West Side Bazaar".  There is a food court, the vendors each have a window.   There are a few seats by the window overlooking Grant Street where you can eat or have a cup of coffee. Then there are vendors selling things, mostly from countries outside the US, but there is a US one as well.  There is a woman selling hats, some of which are gorgeous.  I saw some lovely Indian scarves there as well, and for being sold outside India, good prices.   This is a nice place, in an up and coming neighborhood.  I think it's part of that areas general revival, but it is leading the way.  So some of the area around there seems a little dicey, but its worth the visit midday, street parking out front.  The grand opening is in May I think, but its open now while they work out the kinks.  Stop by here, pick up a gift for someone and have some nice ethnic food in a very relaxed environment.
This place is a perfect example of the exciting progress happening on Buffalo's west side. Local merchants, mostly immigrants set up their own mini stores inside the Bazaar where they sell goods from their home country. Aside from the aisles of jewelry, shea butter,  and unique clothing there are 5 really delicious food stands Peruvian, Thai, Ethiopian, Burmese, Bubble Tea/Bakery. On my last visit I ordered a spicy pork salad from the Thai vendor. I was blown away by the freshness, flavor, and ingredients. This is authentic Thai- light years ahead of some of the other "asian" eateries in town. I am returning ASAP to sample treats from the other vendors, all of which featured interesting menu options. Another must try at the Bazaar- Koop's hot sauce. Koop is more than happy to share samples, and his hot sauces and BBQ sauces are incredibly flavorful. Next time you're craving some foreign foods, hit up the West Side Bazaar for lunch or dinner. Awesome food and wonderful people who are passionate about sharing their food and culture. Bring Cash! Seems most of the vendors do not accept credit card.
What a sweet surprise this place was...it's like a very small scale food court and flea market type place in the heart of buffalo's culturally diverse Grant-Ferry business district...you are greeted by so many friendly and welcoming faces from around the globe and wonderful smells of ginger, curry, and spices...every single vendor made an effort to say hi, smile and answer any questions...a gentleman eating the Burmese noodle plate that looked so warming, comforting and filling, offered to take me to window and order myself the same thing after I inquired about his dish...you can also choose Thai, Peruvian, Ethiopian and all the prices are so reasonable...almost too low...I opted to try some snacks at the smaller stands...a dear woman from Ethiopia offered me a sample of Ethiopian coffee in delicate china demitasse cups...I asked if it was Turkish coffee, she said it's similar and poured me a sample...it was a real treat...something a local coffee connoisseur should take note of and try...she said they also offer Ethiopian spiced tea made fresh by the order...she boiled her coffee in a stovetop percolator on a hot pad...it reminded me of something u would see in a real bazaar or marketplace overseas...she also bakes a couple homemade desserts daily and offers them for purchase with her coffee...the sign over her stand read "Ethiopian coffee ceremony" I felt in made a friend and promised her I would come back again and bring a friend to share in her coffee treasure...my friend felt drawn to the crepe stand run by a kind Burmese man and  he opted for a couple handmade samosas from the warm display case...they were amazingly good...filled with perfectly spiced chicken and veggies and potatoes...a simple sauce accompanied them made from what the gentleman described as tamarind, hot sauce and ketchup (his own concoction) they were unbelievably priced at around $1 each and were so delicate, warm and gentle...I'll definitely be back for more...makes a great midday snack ...and finally my last sampling came as a surprise when I noticed a couple dining and on their table were stacks of small boxes of what looked to me like crispy fried waffles reminiscent of crystal beach...when I inquired they told me they they are delicate sesame cookies fried by the woman at the bubble tea stand...I immediately walked over and inquired...turns out they are just like a fried waffle ...she dips an ornate molded iron rod in batter and lowers them into oil and fries these rosette like pastries then sprinkles them with black sesame seeds...an amazing ending to a surprise drop in at this west side gem...these are the perfect ending to any meal alongside a Demitasse of rich Ethiopian coffee...this place will warm your heart and all of your senses...a must see...
I didn't see any Peruvian food when I was there. The Burmese fried rice is good and the service is also good.
This place presents a fun retail alternative to the mall. As Joe P notes, you're not going to get nearly as much joy out of a splurge at some crappy chain as you will by buying homemade, hand-painted jewelry crafted from seeds and colorful beads, sold by the groovy entrepreneurs at the Bazaar. From Indonesian prints to African earrings, there's a lot of cool stuff here. So, next time you find yourself free on a sunny Saturday, do yourself a favor: skip the frantic errand-running in the burbs, head to the Westside for a coffee at Sweetness_7, trundle over to this little shop, and finish up with a browse at Westside Stories. There now. Feel that sensation of relaxation and curiosity spreading over you? When was the last time you felt that inside a Payless Shoesource? That's what I thought.
I love coming here.  I love being able to get delicious, exotic, inexpensive food in Buffalo that you used to have to go to Toronto to find.  I love to see  our immigrant communities having the opportunity to make a living while exposing us to their interesting cultures.    The Ethiopian coffee alone is worth the trip. My only gripe is that the close so early.
This is my new favorite place. There are so many fantastic vegan options here. I love it! I've only tried the Ethiopian so far--the veggie platter. It was delicious! Huge portions! I will be coming back. I did check out the other restaurant menus and there were many vegan options. There is bubble tea, too. I'm so happy about an authentic cafeteria style eatery opening in the west side.
This place (literally) has a little something for everyone. Wall Art, scarfs, jewelry, clothes, statues, head bands, Pottery and a lot more. My sister got these amazing woven hair clips, I found a beautiful pair of earrings, and my mom got some beautiful baskets for fruit. My brother even found an awesome picture of a giraffe he now has hung in his room. Perfect place to shop for unique holiday and birthday gifts. Since all of the goods are Hand crafted by refugees and all the money goes to supporting them, it's a win-win. A perfect example of a small business that helps to raise people up.
Big fan!  I tried the Ethiopian food booth, and my friends tried the Thai and Burmese.  Everybody was happy with different selections, and we could all eat lunch together.  I need to go back and try some of the other foods next time!
There are several different stalls - each selling items from a different country from Rwanda to Peru to Nepal.  Makes for some great international decorations.
