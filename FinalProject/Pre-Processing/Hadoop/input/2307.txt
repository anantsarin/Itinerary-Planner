I love, love, love Wegmans.  I know, that sounds sort of pathetic, but it's true.  Let's face it -- grocery shopping is a *chore*, but Wegmans makes it about as fun as it can be. The food product selection is amazing (there must be 300 varieties of cheese alone) and the prices are not bad at all, certainly no worse than I've seen at far inferior supermarkets.  They appear to have week-in-week-out rock-bottom pricing on certain staples (milk, eggs, butter, bread) as well, though perhaps we've just been lucky. Wegmans is perhaps not the best place for non-grocery items, though.  I wanted aluminum foil one time and was kind of surprised at how few options there were (I don't think that there was a store brand, for example) but that's a minor quibble.  All in all, Wegmans is the best supermarket I've ever had occasion to shop in.
This is an excellent supermarket for many reasons.  Several of them are listed below...   1) The prepared foods section has food that is actually better than the food found in the vast majority of upstate NY restaurants. 2) Prices are really REALLY good in this store. 3) They have self-service checkouts so you do not have to deal with cashiers (though when I have dealt with cashiers in the past they are generally friendly). 4) Great range of a variety of things... lots of Latino food selection (Goya products, etc), healthy foods, protein supplements, etc. 5) Open 24/7... kind of shocking for a town where most people seem to call it a night around dusk. 6) Big parking lot, so you can always find a space without having to wait in line (even when it is busy). There is no other supermarket I would go to in Ithaca.
My favorite grocery ever.  I wish I still lived in ITH just so I could still go to Wegmans.
This is a great grocery store. They have a very good selection of ethnic ingredients, prepared food, cheeses, meats and seafood. Their bakery is amazing, especially their chocolate ganache cakes. Unfortunately, the deli sometimes closes a few minutes early on slow nights, before their posted hours. This is annoying. In my opinion reputable businesses stick to their posted hours! The prices can be high for some things but are low for others.
when high school kids go to wegmans to hang out before and after prom, you know it's the place to be. after shopping at wegmans i don't believe it when other stores like albertson or safeway call themselves "supermarkets." if they're supermarkets, then wegmans should be called a superdupermarket or a tremendousmarket. sure, i didn't do much cooking back in the day, but i could pretty much find everything i needed there and more! swiffer, laundry detergent, corelle dinnerware, fresh pizza, fresh sushi, ethnic ingredients (for when i did cook), ready-to-eat buffet, bench swings out front, the air conditioning blast at the front entrance threshold.

This is just a grocery store, folks.  There is nothing awe-inspiring or amazing about Wegmans.  I have heard so many people professing their love for Wegmans and talking about what a great grocery store it is.  It's just a normal grocery store with a normal amount of variety.  I really do not understand the big to-do over Wegmans.  Maybe everyone who thinks it's amazing is from a really small town without a reasonable place to buy groceries. Saturdays at the Ithaca Wegmans are insufferable.  It's like the biggest shopping cart traffic jam I've ever seen with the typical indecisive Ithaca drivers at the helm of the shopping carts.  If you've ever driven in Ithaca, you can imagine that the shopping cart traffic jams within Wegmans are silly and unnecessary, but constant.  If you must go to Wegmans, go around 8 PM when the aisles are not cluttered.

So much better than Tops.  They offer a great selection of foods with lots of variety.  However, it is always so crowded when I go and the parking lot is a zoo.

This is another place in Ithaca that I wish I could pick up and bring home with me to PA.  I have a few different Wegmans locations close to my home, but none as awesome as this.  The prepared foods section is huge and offers a ton of variety.  The beer section is impressively big and well-stocked.  The natural market section goes on for aisles and aisles.  And the candy section...it's just enormous.  I also love that they roast coffee right in the store for you and always try to grab a bag to bring home with me when I'm there!  Oh, and they even have dry cleaning here!

Wegmans is great for fresh groceries, I don't usually shop Wegmans due to the fact that it is over crowded by too many people. There is never any place to park unless you are at the back of the huge parking lot. The only time I go there is to access the pasta station. I love there pasta, you can choose what you want from the pasta to the ingredients to the sauce. I don't usually get anything from the Chinese food bar because it is overpriced at 6.99 a pound. (way too much!)

I graduated from college three years ago and I miss Wegman's terribly. Best supermarket of all time. The end.

The second day I lived in Ithaca, I discovered Wegman's. I was unsuspecting of its glory as it was just on a list given to me by my new employer. When I walked in, I almost wept. Wegman's is amazing. It is hard to put into words. Try as you might to explain why it is so wonderful, but people just don't understand why you might conduct a job search based on Wegman's locations until they experience it first hand. Just a great grocery store.

I loved how it was open 24 hours a day! However, the produce isn't the freshest late at night, as it is all the leftovers from the day.  However, this Wegman's is very clean and huge and has everything you could want.  I like how the lines go fast.  Perfect place to go food shopping.

So amazing.  When my parents came to visit, they made sure to stay in the Super 8 whenever they could not because it's a great motel, but because it's adjacent to the Wegman's parking lot.  If my dad wanted sushi at 4am, there it was, fresh and waiting.  Back in the days when Uris closed at 2am we would head down to Wegmans to continue studying or procrastinate in the foreign foods aisles.  Always a stop on any trip back to Ithaca.

AMAZING. Let me elaborate with a few anecdotes. 1) I needed a nighttime eye-lubricant because I was having issues with eye-dryness. I went to Wilson Farms; they didn't carry it. I stopped by Target; they were out of stock. I tried Wegmans, and they had two different kinds.   2) I am a great lover of fruit. I feel, however, that Ithaca is greatly lacking when it comes to its selection of fruit---especially exotic fruit. But BEHOLD! Wegmans! Dragon fruit, lychee, star fuit, rambutan, purple mangosteen, coconut, and even cherimoya! Unfortunately, ONE cherimoya cost me $8, but it was worth it. Yum... 3) Are your tastes very specific for a particular spice, herb, or ingredient? Want fresh rosemary? Got it. Dried rosemary? Got it. Organic fresh rosemary? Got that too. Rosemary, tarragon, and marjoram blend? Got that too (with a hint of lavender). Same goes for mint, or basil, or parsley, or cilantro... 4) Went to the pharmacy to pick up a prescription for eye-drops. They said they'd have it in 15-20 minutes if I wanted to wait. I checked in about 10 minutes. My eye-drops were there already. Speedy service. I appreciate that. Overall, the food is fresh, the service is decent and there is just such wonderful variety that this grocery store beats out all others nearby. I even noticed that there isn't a weird "food" smell when you walk in. You know how sometimes grocery stores have that older food smell, maybe overripe fruit or limp veggies? None of that here. Also, the price ranges are good: you can find expensive organic free-range non-hormone injected, free-from-antibiotics cow juice, or just plain old Campbell's beef broth. Moreover, I love the fact that there is a pasta bar, vegetarian bar, deli, ethnic food bar, and whatever else you'd want at the Wegmans cafe (inside/connected to the store). Finally, it has a great, convenient location and a decent sized parking lot (although some people really need to learn how to drive, how to park, how NOT to steal my parking spot if I've been signaling for five minutes, how NOT to let their carts drift pell-mell all over the place, and how NOT to walk in the middle of the street while I am trying to drive past them). Minor note: They have a good beer selection, but sometimes I wish they had more wine. Trader Joe's usually beats them in this aspect, as does a midsized-large Safeway or QFC in general. Also, depending on when you go, this place can be PACKED. I dislike the teeming crowds, especially with screaming small children and parents who don't know how to discipline them (this has happened on multiple occasions). Chose the day and time you go carefully. If you can, go mid-day or earlier, on a weekday.

Greatest supermarket I have ever been to and I have been to: tops, safeway, frys, aldi, trader joes, walmart/target if you consider those as supermarkets. They have fresh fish and meats very nicely cut up. Very clean environment for the butchering and packaging it seems like. Prices are fairly reasonable for the fresh products. Frozen selection is also great. Overall a great supermarket that sells basically everything you could want. This one in particular also sells local ithaca brews.

I've been to Wegman's only twice, but both experiences have left me frustrated. I recently moved here from out-of-state, having lived near and shopped at Trader Joe's.  What I love about TJ's is that there was no separate "organic" or "health food" section in the store; rather, healthy or not, everything in the store is head-and-shoulders above the typical mass produced national brands and mostly devoid of additives.  TJ's are also reasonably priced and comfortably sized, so you can generally see one end of the store from the other. Wegman's, on the other hand, is too big for its own good.  There, you can buy Chex in the cereal aisle for an inflated price, but if you want good stuff without BHT, red 40, high fructose corn syrup, and god-knows-what--in other words, if you want what you would find at Trader Joe's--you have to go to the separate "healthy food" part of the store, then continue where you left off.  Most of the products not in the special health-nut section are the same mass produced stuff you can get for less money at Tops or even Target.  You can't even buy tortillas that aren't loaded with preservatives, or at least I couldn't find any. Want mozzarella?  You can get the stiff-as-a-brick stuff in the cheese section.  You can also get grated mozzarella near the meat counter about 100 feet away around the corner.  Or you can get the good stuff near the snooty fancy cheese bar.  Three different places to get mozzarella, and they aren't close to each other--the only way you would know about the other areas is if you aimlessly wandered every aisle.  A similar situation applies to spaghetti sauce, beans, you name it. The layout seems designed to encourage multiple trips across the length of the store.  The meat counter is near the produce section, in the same general area as the prepared foods, tucked just enough away that you have to cross the entire width of the store to get back to the meat counter after loading up on non-perishables. Overall?  I think the place is being crushed by its own overpriced, disorganized bulk, and offers little that can't already be found in most other stores with more convenient parking for less money.  This is a solid store for a captive market like Ithaca, but Trader Joe's would run them out of town, given the chance.

Having moved far, far away from Wegman's, I can openly say that nothing here in Denver compares - not even Whole Foods. Although I had difficulty from time to time with the Pharmacy, I loved being able to buy soda and organic foods in one place - can't do that at Whole Foods, and every now and then I need a pack of Coke! Wegman's has such a wide variety of foods - more than any other store I've seen, and the employees, especially Cody in the meat department, are friendly, helpful, and made me feel SPECIAL - just for going to the grocery!

"Woohoo! As good as it gets!" aptly summarizes the Wegmans experience.  You simply will not find a better grocery store anywhere.  The fresh produce section is incredible, they bake all their bread daily, and they have reasonable prices.  This is one of the only cities I know of where another place dominates Wal-Mart.  Well done, Wegmans.

This place is nuts! It is, without a doubt, the largest super market I've ever been in.  It has everything you could possibly want and more! They have those double decker carts too, which are helpful when navigating the packed aisles on a Saturday afternoon.

The jewel and creme de la creme of my trip to Ithaca, NY was Wegman's. It's as if a grocery store and a highly functioning mall had a love child, and boy was it a big baby. There's everything your heart could ever desire tucked away in this giant factory. The candy section is unbelievable---I kept looking for Willy!

Everytime I go into Wegmans I can feel my tummy grumbling.  The first thing I do is go to the bakery section and smell the newly fresh baked bread.  This place is packed like no other on Saturday so definitely go in the evening on Saturday because you will see everyone you know there.

I'm from Canada, and I wish we had something like Wegmans. I love Wegmans, it's a foodie's dream supermarket. The meats are fantastic, the deli counter slices meats properly. The cheese guys actually know their cheeses and are a pleasure to talk to. And all the local produce......fantastic! Oh and the olive bar OH MY GOD! Wegmans please come to Canada!

Wegmans is my go-to of go-to stores. Honestly, what don't they have? From farm fresh foods to craft your own meals to an abundance of other options such as Asian, Italian, Indian cuisines for the busy on-the-go individual...Wegmans has it all!

Has anyone looked at their receipt and compared it to shopping at Tops? Pretty pricey place. Great bakery, subs, deli, and produce. Everything is pricey but those areas are of top quality. For the rest of your grocery needs, go elsewere.

If someone were to take a survey on people's favorite places in the world, I'm sure most answers would resemble something like the beach, Tahiti, Vegas, Madame Camae's Filipino Palace etc. I think my answer would be Wegmans. This is the most amazing, awesome, dream come true supermarket that you could ever ask for. It is a great place for ramen noodle eating, low budget college students and foodies or culinary masters alike. Wegmans has just about everything, from low end generic options to quality artesan products and exotic items that you can't find anywhere else. It's also an awesome restaurant in itself. There are so many meal options, from pizza to made to order burritos to indian food buffets to freshly made sushi. I also love Wegman's bulk/produce price system. Weighing your stuff and printing out a little sticker with the price is pretty cool, though can get hectic on Sat. afternoons when every  I'm Gonna Park My Cart in the Middle of the Aisle Oblivious Asshole comes to shop. Their beer selection is pretty good too, but you can get all those beers for slightly cheaper prices down the road at Ithaca Beverage Center. In addition to having an amazing selection, they treat their employees way better than most companies by giving them benefits and insurance, even for part timers! As others have pointed out, the fact that this is open 24 hours is a huge plus. It's kind of a stoner's late night munchy paradise.

I added Wegman's as my friend on Friendster like 4 years ago.  That's all I'm saying.

Clean, good service, good prices, quality selection, excellent prepared foods/bakery/coffee bar.  Ithaca loves its Wegmans!

In Ithaca, you don't have many options.  Wegman's is probably the best option in town. However, the produce is often old.  The bagged apples are often mealy.  I've repeatedly gotten funky potatoes in the big bags of potatoes. Check-out is really slow because the same person rings you up and bags. Customer service is pretty good. Organization in the store is terrible.  For any one type of item, there are usually about 4 places you can find it.  For example, black beans are in the "latin american" food aisle, but also in the "canned beans" aisle and probably 2 other places that i haven't even found yet.   Also, products are often out of stock for weeks at a time. The ethnic food selection and beer selection are pretty good, though.

The best club in Ithaca. Period.

Love their food court. Has an interesting selection of food too. A bit more expensive than I imagined for a self-serve though. A plate full of food costs more than ten dollars.

Wonderful produce and great selection. They even have samples at certain time of day. Easily accessible by bus. however, the prices are a little bit more expensive than your average Super Walmart.
I hate this place. It's cheap, but it's also gigantic and I can never find anything. Everything is grouped in three places. The employees don't even know where to find the products I ask for. I go in for a few items and spend an hour. I'd rather go to Green Star just to save my time for something better than stumbling around a grocery store.

It's kinda sad to say that a supermarket is the best thing going on about Ithaca, but it's true. i gave this place five stars because it's the most entertaining thing in Ithica. This place feels like a Whole Foods, but is more approachable and affordable. I love the large selection and hot foods.
OMG.  Who doesn't love Wegmans?  It's a must-go-to place whenever my friends and I visit Ithaca.  Although much has changed since we went to school at IC, (Wegmans has gotten a lot bigger and even physically moved) it is still one of the most amazing supermarkets to shop in based on variety and selection alone.  Just don't try to take any photos or videos inside the store, as always, they will give you a warning and/or escort you out.  It also provides excellent entertainment and after-hours fun in the wee hours of the morning after the bars have closed but you don't want to go home.  Well, I don't know if it still does, but it used to...  just be careful in the bulk foods section.  ;)

OMG love Wegmans! Sure it's kinda pricey but it has everything you can possible want in a grocery store. I love the bakery section and used to be obsessed with their chocolate muffins (unfortunately I had to break that addiction). I
It's kinda sad to say that a supermarket is the best thing going on about Ithaca, but it's true. i gave this place five stars because it's the most entertaining thing in Ithica. This place feels like a Whole Foods, but is more approachable and affordable. I love the large selection and hot foods.
I LOVE WEGMANS!! If I could be a groupie, I would be. The food selection is amazing and the quality is wonderful too. Best place for groceries by far!
OMG.  Who doesn't love Wegmans?  It's a must-go-to place whenever my friends and I visit Ithaca.  Although much has changed since we went to school at IC, (Wegmans has gotten a lot bigger and even physically moved) it is still one of the most amazing supermarkets to shop in based on variety and selection alone.  Just don't try to take any photos or videos inside the store, as always, they will give you a warning and/or escort you out.  It also provides excellent entertainment and after-hours fun in the wee hours of the morning after the bars have closed but you don't want to go home.  Well, I don't know if it still does, but it used to...  just be careful in the bulk foods section.  ;)
If you cant find it here, it probably doesnt exist.

Best grocery store ever! Has everything you need. Better selection than stores anywhere by far. It's heavenly! Their store brand items are usually better than the brand name ones or on par! You'd think the prices would be steep but they are affordable and more than fair! If you need something besides a degree from Cornell or IC in Ithaca, chances are you can get it at Wegmans

Oh boy does Wegman's put King Soopers and Whole Foods to shame, without a doubt! People in Colorado think I'm weird for raving about a grocery store, but they just do not understand. This is the Ritz Carlton of food markets, minus the price tag. And I wish they'd dominate the world of grocery stores. I can say what everyone else is saying. Then again, I'd rather not be repetitive. I MISS YOU WEGMAN'S!

Dear Wegman's I love you. You make it possible for me to live in this small town. How do love thee, let me count the ways; 1. The Wegman's food court is the best restaurant in Ithaca. 2. Huge selection of international groceries, at really good prices. Fills a huge niche in a town with 3. Open 24 hours. 3. Amazing selection of artisan and international cheeses. 4. Big organic/natural section, at way better prices than Greenstar. 5. great customer service. 6. Great prices on staple items. I would like to know how many different items they stock. At least 50,000 I'm guessing. But I would love to know!

What's not to love about Wegmans. It's as much a tourist attraction as Taughannock Falls!

I LOVE THIS STORE!!! That said it is too bad, for me, that I live in the Chicago area. 700 miles is a bit far to go for even this grocery store! The good news is that my son is only a sophmore at Ithaca, so I will be there several more times over the next 2 1/2 years. I think you can judge a community by its grocery store(s). Wegman speaks very well for the city of Ithaca! Other reviews have mentioned it is like Whole Foods. I could not disagree more. I have a whole foods less than 2 miles from my house. I have been in Wegmans more than I have been in Whole Foods. Over priced items at Whole Foods really don't interest me. Also I don't think you can really do all your shopping in a Whole Foods. At Wegmans you certainly can. The store, in Ithaca, is buzzing each time I have been there. There is always a large nimber of pleasant and knowledgable staff to assist with any need. While I have not purchased any, the fresh fish and meats look great. the produce is wonderful and fairly priced as well. They have a large number of staff baking bread, cutting vegatables and putting together sliced fruit. All very good! The prepared market is out of this world. Foods of every type are avialable. They are hot and constantly refilled so as to be fresh. Additionally, they will make sandwiches and have people making sushi throughout the day. The store is kept very clean and I have always felt confortable in the store. They also have a bulk food section which is very diverse. Each time I have been there they have also had various items available to taste. Recently this hs included; bread, sushi, slamon and various cheeses. Oh how I wish that there was a Wegmans in the Chicagoland are! There is nothing that comes close, NOTHING! The prices are very good! The staff is plentiful and always helpful! The food choices and the quality are first rate!! This to me is how a grocery store should be! On my most recent trip to Ithaca we actually went there 3 times in one weekend!!! Keep up the great job! Oh yeah, start opening store in Illinois,please!!!

This is the best place in Ithaca. You know I go to different grocery to compare prices. I went to the bargain grocery stores, but they don't match Wegmans for quality NOR price. I love going to wegmans during their special coffee hour. 54 cents for 12 oz coffee. The soup is delicious too. The ultimate chocolate cake is super special, but i would limit it to one serving per year. Also great at wegmans is their beer selection. You can find anything there. I don't think I can truly express in words how i feel about wegmans. i would go everyday if i had a car just to walk through the aisles and see the happy people shopping there.

This place is great.  It's always clean, neat, fair, and friendly.  I think they get a bad rep sometimes for being expensive, but it's only because they offer some better options than other grocery stores.  Compare the essentials and they ARE competitive.  What's more is that they're always open, have bottle/recycling return area/good and reasonable prepared foods along with a nice sitting area boasting free internet access. They make me hate going to P&C even though it's 2 minutes from my house and Wegman's is 10.

Wegman's is not just a grocery store, it is a way of life...and Ithaca has one of the finest Wegman's around. Definitely a must-see when visiting Ithaca. You can even sit down and enjoy a nice meal there. Great for college students as well
There is, literally, nothing bad to be said about the Wegman's experience. This place is truly a marvel and make grocery shopping something to look forward to. Their specialty selection of Glucose free, vegan and vegetarian foods is the most impressive I have ever seen...not to mention their insanely fantastic candy section that would make anyone drool. Their selection of beer is hard to beat-even up against a liquor store. You can get Yeungling's, Black & Tan's and all kinds of specialty beers we can get here in Chicago! I loaded up the back of my vehicle when I left Ithaca with beer and candy from Wegman's! Also, they just happen to make THE BEST re-usable shopping bags I have ever come across. I use mine daily and only wish I had purchased more!
Wegmans has no real competition in Ithaca. My only complaint is that of the fish mongers I've only had a good experience with one of them.  The other fish mongers are either disgusted by the fish they are selling (in the case of the smoked herring) or just plain rude.
Wegman's is to true "foodies" (and I am one) what the vatican is to catholics.  It has everything.  While some assert that their prices are high, I do not.  I have a black belt in comparison shopping, and usually find the "Shoppers Club" items coupled with a coupon  make a very good value.  It depends on what you buy.  I shop the walls, so my bill is usually pretty high, plus some exotic ingredients I use.  Their produce section, along with the largest organics section in the northeast will bring tears to the eyes of the uninitiated, and international food section is breathtaking.  The pharmacy has the lowest prices we have found. They have a fantasic prepared food section; a fabulous patisserie, exquisite bagels, a huge deli, with premium meat and cheese (BTW - Boar's Head is not premium, and they do not carry it)  Old World Cheese, which has every kind of cheese you can think of, a butcher shop and seafood counter that will spoil you, and a counter with $6  meals.  Also, a sushi bar, an Asian Wokery, vegetarian buffet, a lunch buffet, apizza and sub shop (great pizza and subs!) AND THEY ALL CLOSE AT 9:00 P.M ON THE DOT!!!   The only con to shopping there are the rude, obnoxious students from Cornell and Ithaca College, who were somehow smart enough to get into these institutions, but were raised with absolutely NO MANNERS, So, beware.  You will have to tolerate a lot from these jerks, but it's not Wegs fault.   The best day to shop is Monday or Tuesday.  Stay away on the weekend. Wegman's is so beloved in the foodie community, that one of our correspondents declined a promotion and transfer, because there was no Wegman's in the new town. When I have visitors  here, I take them to  tour Weggies, just like I do Niagara Falls, and other sites in NY.
As a native of Rochester, NY I felt a sigh of relief wash over me when I realized that attending Cornell University meant that I would still have access to Wegmans. In my mind no other grocery store in the country compares to Wegmans and I've been all over. The only store that could get mentioned in the same sentence would have to be Whole Foods and even that is a stretch. Wegmans in Rochester, Ithaca, Pennsylvania or Maryland, it doesn't matter where you go the stores are unique yet still maintain the decor that proclaims its Wegmans roots, the staff is knowledgeable and friendly, and the products are fresh and delicious. If you've never been please find the time if you're in the Ithaca area or any area that has a Wegmans grocery store for that matter; you will be blown away.
OK, I've been shopping at Weggie's for almost twenty years now, it it's gotten to the point that their layout has so totally pissed me off that I'm not going any more.  The produce section is now organized so that it is not possible to get through without either knocking over a display, a restocking cart, or a little old lady at least once on your way through. They leave restocking carts everywhere, especially at the busiest times of day.  Fine, you want to slow people down so they'll buy more? Not gonna work for me.  Shopping is a necessity, not a hobby. I'll go somewhere I can get it done less stressfully.
I used to love Wegmans in Ithaca and I have lived here for a couple of years. However, the other day, I had a most unfortunate experience with a manager who was downright rude and extremely unprofessional which is why I am writing this. Moreover, he lied about store rules and regulations to me. I will not go to Wegmans in Ithaca anymore. Greenstar, Tops & P&C are good enough for me.

It might be a sin in Ithaca to hate Wegmans, but Jesus died for my sins so if I am not sinning he died for nothing. I do hate Wegmans.  I have had so many bad experiences there.  Somehow I am forced to shop there maybe twice a year and I alway regreat it. This year I shopped there twice.  Once to get pre-cut squash.  It turned to mush 2 days later.  I brought it back and they refunded no problem (so that is a plus).  Next time I needed Pitas and no one had any.  Wegmans did.  I bought them for a party the NEXT day.  At the party opened them up and mold!  All of them covered in it!  It still had a week left on the dates.  Returned again (no problems... I think they get a lot of returns). While there that time I thought I would pick up some Ground turkey.  I searched and only found a small section at $8.29 a lb (It was $2.39 a pound at Aldi).  I thought for sure I found the wrong Turkey, I just wanted generic 93/7 turkey.  This must be 93/7 turkey that was hand feed romaine only by a Monk and died of old age... blah blah blah.  After searching for 5 minutes for a human to ask where the rest of their ground turkey is she told me this was it.  I asked why is it so expensive, I can go to any other grocery store in town and buy it for less then $3 a pound?   She replied in the snottiest voice "Well this is food you can feel good about!" and stormed off in a huff. I yelled back "I won't feel so good about it when it comes time to pay for it!" I guess my relationship with Wegmans soured 10 years ago when they lost our wedding photos.  Our photographer brought a dozen rolls there for one hour photo (he always does that with important film development so it does not get lost).  He dropped them off, we were to pick them up.  When we did we noticed some whispers, but thought nothing of it.  They gave us our film (for those under 25 cameras used to use this thing called film, google it) and we thought the bill was cheaper then expected, but whatever.  We got to the car to look at it and there was only a few rolls.  We called the photographer and he told us he dropped off 12 rolls.  We went back and they finally told us they had lost them.  No apology no nothing, they explained that they keep a garbage can next to the machine and frequently people bump the machine and rolls fall in.  It has happened in the past, but now they have moved the can (like that would make us feel better).  We asked if anyone went out to the dumpster or anything once this was realized and of course not.  We offered but they said this was several days ago and it is long gone (which was probably true). We asked why they didn't tell us when we first came in and they said they thought we knew. It was like watching a bunch of children who broke a cookie jar.  Trying to hide and lie and come up with excuses. I guess Wegmans is always on the top 10 for best places to work because they don't hold their employees responsible for all their screw ups.

i wish there was a wegmans in northern california!!  this place has everything, i swear!!  there is a fresh bakery, ready to eat hot foods, pharmacy, fresh produce, video store, amazing meat and cheese selection, dry cleaners and a lot more!!  this place is like costco except you don't have to buy things in bulk!!  it is one of my favorite things about the east coast.. i could come here everyday and find something new to enjoy!!  prices are normal supermarket prices and food is insanely gourmet!!  it is also open 24 hours a day for those college students who get the midnight munchies.. i am counting the days till wegmans comes to california.  i will be there with bells on!!

this, my friends, is the creme de la creme of grocery stores.  it is amazing.  absolutely amazing.  i love and adore and cherish and revere wegmans with every fibre of my being.  danny wegman should win an nobel peace prize. now, it would be silly of me to make such a grand statement about wegmans without qualifying it, so here i go: - the subs.  oh my geez, the subs.  seeded bread + LOTS of MEAT and CHEESE + veggies + oil and vinegar.  yeah, it sounds simple and like you could make it at home.  but i'm telling you, by some miracle the sub makers create something that is not duplicateable. - the cheese selection.  *drool* (accompanied by the homer simpson sound)  they have every kind of cheese known to humanity, or at least known to me, and that's all i can really ask for.  it is there that i discovered this delicious norwegian cheese, gjetost.  it's bizarre, but so amazingly good.  mmm. - BULK FRIGGIN CANDY!  oh my gosh.  this is every child's dream.  shoot, it's every adult with an inner child's dream.  so many kinds.  so little space in my tummy!  and i'm the obnoxious girl who will stand at the gummy worm bin for 10 minutes, picking out the red and white ones.  i know, i'm horrible.  but i know what i like, and i go after it. - tofu kan.  ok, i'm sure you can get this anywhere, but wegmans is where i discovered it, and continues to be the only place i buy it.  it's so good in anything.  in my more gluttonous days, i would just rip open the pack and chomp down.  mmmm. - in college, i subsisted on wegmans brand elbows and mac 'n cheese because they were both 4/$1!!!!!!!  the thought of macaroni elbows melts my heart just a little bit. - the produce.  oh the produce.  that in itself could be its own store.  they have friggin EVERYthing there, from all over the world.  it's mind-blowing i could go on forever.  but i'll stop.  much to my dismay.  except to say their cooked mac 'n cheese is super duper good too.  but that's it.  i'm done.

I really enjoy shopping at Wegmans because it is truly one stop shopping.  The produce and prepared food sections are especially great, and I love the gelato here.  It does get quite crowded, but I haven't found it unmanageable.

This is an awesome super market.  You can find such a great variety and at really great prices!

Great food, amazing customer service, wide variety, and surprisingly the prices are overall very reasonable. After buying a fruit basket, one of the associates generously made it look really nice for my specific occasion. I've never met an unfriendly staff member and always enjoy shopping here. It will be busy, so watch out for that.
If you can't find it in Ithaca, chances are you can't find it in a grocery store in Ithaca. I love Wegmans for the produce, the wide variety in the international section, and the reasonable prices. Sometimes, though, I hate Wegmans for the parking lot and how crowded it gets. It's not their fault that they're busy, though, and they're good about keeping as many checkout lines open as they can staff. Don't go at peak hours--especially on weekends--and you'll have all the time and space you'll want to browse.
Wegman's has all of Ithaca by the testicles, but only mostly for good reasons. Wegman's is unquestionably the best grocery store in Ithaca.  The quality and variety is unparalleled.  This place has nearly everything - a ridiculously huge meat and prepared foods section, an extensive array of Asian foods that would make some Asian grocery stores blush, etc.  It frequently has foods that are, simply put, rare in the U.S.  On top of it all, the store is immaculate, the staff are incredibly nice, and the overall ambiance is pleasing. The problem with Wegman's is the price.  Competitors in the area compete via price, meaning that Wegman's is frequently the most expensive game in town.  If you're looking for the basics that aren't likely to vary in quality - for example, specific brands of  a prepackaged food - then Wegman's will generally be more expensive than going somewhere else.  The same equally applies to produce where quality is not as easily noticed, like bananas. Thus, Wegman's puts you in something of a pickle.  If you want to save money, shopping here is generally a bad idea - you can pay as much as 50% more for the same food, albeit at a slightly better quality.  Contrariwise, if you want to be cheap, you have to tolerate the absolutely terrible alternatives in the area.  Sad, but true.
I used to love Wegmans in Ithaca and I have lived here for a couple of years. However, the other day, I had a most unfortunate experience with a manager who was downright rude and extremely unprofessional which is why I am writing this. Moreover, he lied about store rules and regulations to me. I will not go to Wegmans in Ithaca anymore. Greenstar, Tops & P&C are good enough for me.
This is the best grocery store, hands down. The staff are friendly and do their jobs 97% of the time (ever place has their negative nancy). The atmosphere is nice on the eyes and gives the impression of expensive shopping, even though the prices are very competitive to those around such as Tops and Walmart. They have just about everything and are great for a one stop shop or a long trip. You can sit in the cafe with your laptop or speed through the busy aisles for your necessities. Some will say it is too busy. Well, what is a good business supposed to do about that? They are popular because they are a great store, the best, and I have traveled a lot and Whole Foods is the only thing that has come close and the atmosphere is very lacking. Wegmans for life.
Wegmans scares me.  I've just moved out here from California and I have never been so overwhelmed by a grocery store. It was like the Super Walmart of Wholefoods.  Maybe someday at 2am I will get a craving for sushi and dog food, I'll go back to wegmans.
Wegman's - and this goes for every Wegman's I've ever been to - is the only big box western grocery store that I actually like. Let me qualify that. There's nothing wrong with most of the places I go to for groceries. The produce is passable, they have what I need, I get in, and I get out. That's exactly it, though - I get nothing more than what I needed, and I leave. Whereas, with Wegmans, I actually ENJOY browsing the place, checking out what products that Wegmans actually produces, which are usually better and cheaper than their name brand counterparts, and overall just enjoying that everything in the place is prepared and sold by people who are actually kind of happy to be there. Wegmans products, if you didn't get it, kick ass. And they have EVERYTHING. I mean, you might be able to find specialty items more easily in say, an artisan butcher's shop. But, If you're looking for anything up to "damned good" quality, they have it. It's like Trader Joe's got married to Whole Foods, had a kid named Wegmans, and Trader Joe's realized that Whole Foods was a high maintenance whiny cry-baby, got custody of Wegmans, and raised her to never be bouge, and always be awesome. I need a Wegmans that isn't a 45 minute drive from my house. Sigh.
It might be a sin in Ithaca to hate Wegmans, but Jesus died for my sins so if I am not sinning he died for nothing. I do hate Wegmans.  I have had so many bad experiences there.  Somehow I am forced to shop there maybe twice a year and I alway regreat it.

I guess my relationship with Wegmans soured 10 years ago when they lost our wedding photos.  Our photographer brought a dozen rolls there for one hour photo (he always does that with important film development so it does not get lost).  He dropped them off, we were to pick them up.  When we did we noticed some whispers, but thought nothing of it.  They gave us our film (for those under 25 cameras used to use this thing called film, google it) and we thought the bill was cheaper then expected, but whatever.  We got to the car to look at it and there was only a few rolls.  We called the photographer and he told us he dropped off 12 rolls.  We went back and they finally told us they had lost them.  No apology no nothing, they explained that they keep a garbage can next to the machine and frequently people bump the machine and rolls fall in.  It has happened in the past, but now they have moved the can (like that would make us feel better).  We asked if anyone went out to the dumpster or anything once this was realized and of course not.  We offered but they said this was several days ago and it is long gone (which was probably true). We asked why they didn't tell us when we first came in and they said they thought we knew. It was like watching a bunch of children who broke a cookie jar.  Trying to hide and lie and come up with excuses. I guess Wegmans is always on the top 10 for best places to work because they don't hold their employees responsible for all their screw ups.
I have no idea how to rate Wegman's because there are things that are awesome about it and things that absolutely suck about it. Awesome: Great food selection.. you can find almost any kind of esoteric thing here, from produce to baked goods to meat to dry and international goods. The beer selection is good (although not as good as Ithaca Coffee Company tavern or Finger Lakes Beverage) and I'm not kidding when I say that Wegman's has yet to be stumped no matter what I'm looking for. I thought I had finally found something they don't carry when I couldn't find Devonshire cream in the British aisle. Nope, I was just looking in the wrong place. They have like 3 varieties of it in the cold case by the cheese. Suckage: Expensive, so expensive. Nothing really is ever on sale, or anything you want anyway. My total here is easily twice what it would be for the same amount of stuff in other cities. Stop in for a few things, $100. Shop for the week, $200, and that's just for meats, dairy, and produce. Also: At pretty much any time of the day, Wegman's is jam-packed with all kinds of people, including those who are, shall we say, lacking social graces. I'd recommend going very early or in the middle of the night unless you enjoy being cut off and having carts rammed into your ankles every 5 seconds for a half hour.
Michael O.'s review said it well, that Wegmans is a upscale grocery with (indeed) high prices. even things not bought in the organic section are quite above average in their set price, i adore their bread and cheese section but they would never recieve a 5 star rating in my book since my favorite cheese and bread is usually 'all out' for the day by the time i get to the store after work (6-7pm) that being the case let me clean the slate so-to-speak: Wegman's is no less than a lovely (and remarkably) 24 hour grocery store however; their 'cafe' and take out sections/ food buffet bars is/are NOT 24 hours, they operate at typical meal times and if you get there after 8, you're out of luck for hot food pal, sorry. they have a abundant array of food for any carnivore however, their vegan and vegetarian options are slim, few and bland. I highly reccomend getting there early in the AM to get the best bread called Marco Polo.  let it be known that Wegman's ethnic food SUCKS, really.
Great food, amazing customer service, wide variety, and surprisingly the prices are overall very reasonable. After buying a fruit basket, one of the associates generously made it look really nice for my specific occasion. I've never met an unfriendly staff member and always enjoy shopping here. It will be busy, so watch out for that.
i wish there was a wegmans in northern california!!  this place has everything, i swear!!  there is a fresh bakery, ready to eat hot foods, pharmacy, fresh produce, video store, amazing meat and cheese selection, dry cleaners and a lot more!!  this place is like costco except you don't have to buy things in bulk!!  it is one of my favorite things about the east coast.. i could come here everyday and find something new to enjoy!!  prices are normal supermarket prices and food is insanely gourmet!!  it is also open 24 hours a day for those college students who get the midnight munchies.. i am counting the days till wegmans comes to california.  i will be there with bells on!!
Ithaca store is by far one of the best in the chain. I have been to quite a few and Ithaca has the best produce section. Not to fond of them changing the layout all the time but the selection is great! You don't wait very long at the checkouts and the store is always clean. I will continue to shop here forever!
Wegmans is freakin awesome and Ithaca is so lucky to have it. I haven't been to a supermarket that's better than Wegmans. Produce section is very good, although not the freshest (I'm used to buying at Farmers' Markets, though). There's a good selection of both conventional and organic produce, and they have a wide variety, including international fruits and vegetables. They have a relatively small "natural" section which is kind of like a mini Whole Foods, with more "healthier" and "greener" products, it features a fantastic selection of bagged teas. Wegmans has an "Asian" aisle with a bunch of great Japanese and Chinese condiments and Maesri Thai curry paste and Chaokoh coconut milk, my faves! Wegmans also boasts an expansive bulk section, featuring mostly bulk candy, but also a variety of grains, beans, dried fruit, and a large selection of bulk spices, which is awesome. Their national brand of Greek Yogurt is also only $4.29, the cheapest I've ever found, anywhere, and I buy a lot of that stuff. Open 24 hours, very convenient. This is the only place in Ithaca I'll buy my food, until the Farmers' Market opens up again!
Wegman's has all of Ithaca by the testicles, but only mostly for good reasons. Wegman's is unquestionably the best grocery store in Ithaca.  The quality and variety is unparalleled.  This place has nearly everything - a ridiculously huge meat and prepared foods section, an extensive array of Asian foods that would make some Asian grocery stores blush, etc.  It frequently has foods that are, simply put, rare in the U.S.  On top of it all, the store is immaculate, the staff are incredibly nice, and the overall ambiance is pleasing. The problem with Wegman's is the price.  Competitors in the area compete via price, meaning that Wegman's is frequently the most expensive game in town.  If you're looking for the basics that aren't likely to vary in quality - for example, specific brands of  a prepackaged food - then Wegman's will generally be more expensive than going somewhere else.  The same equally applies to produce where quality is not as easily noticed, like bananas. Thus, Wegman's puts you in something of a pickle.  If you want to save money, shopping here is generally a bad idea - you can pay as much as 50% more for the same food, albeit at a slightly better quality.  Contrariwise, if you want to be cheap, you have to tolerate the absolutely terrible alternatives in the area.  Sad, but true.
this, my friends, is the creme de la creme of grocery stores.  it is amazing.  absolutely amazing.  i love and adore and cherish and revere wegmans with every fibre of my being.  danny wegman should win an nobel peace prize. now, it would be silly of me to make such a grand statement about wegmans without qualifying it, so here i go: - the subs.  oh my geez, the subs.  seeded bread + LOTS of MEAT and CHEESE + veggies + oil and vinegar.  yeah, it sounds simple and like you could make it at home.  but i'm telling you, by some miracle the sub makers create something that is not duplicateable. - the cheese selection.  *drool* (accompanied by the homer simpson sound)  they have every kind of cheese known to humanity, or at least known to me, and that's all i can really ask for.  it is there that i discovered this delicious norwegian cheese, gjetost.  it's bizarre, but so amazingly good.  mmm. - BULK FRIGGIN CANDY!  oh my gosh.  this is every child's dream.  shoot, it's every adult with an inner child's dream.  so many kinds.  so little space in my tummy!  and i'm the obnoxious girl who will stand at the gummy worm bin for 10 minutes, picking out the red and white ones.  i know, i'm horrible.  but i know what i like, and i go after it. - tofu kan.  ok, i'm sure you can get this anywhere, but wegmans is where i discovered it, and continues to be the only place i buy it.  it's so good in anything.  in my more gluttonous days, i would just rip open the pack and chomp down.  mmmm. - in college, i subsisted on wegmans brand elbows and mac 'n cheese because they were both 4/$1!!!!!!!  the thought of macaroni elbows melts my heart just a little bit. - the produce.  oh the produce.  that in itself could be its own store.  they have friggin EVERYthing there, from all over the world.  it's mind-blowing i could go on forever.  but i'll stop.  much to my dismay.  except to say their cooked mac 'n cheese is super duper good too.  but that's it.  i'm done.

For those of you familiar with Wegman's I don't even need to write a review. You know why its an amazing 5 star place, and this Wegman's is no exception. In fact, its a super example.  For those of you not familiar with Wegman's you are missing out on one of the great grocery stores of our time!  Overstatement you say? That is because you have never been. The only grudge that I hold against you Wegman's is that you are not in Ohio and I can only enjoy you when I travel. That is not fair.
I go to grocery stores all over the country and the Wegman's chain is probably second only to Trader Joe's in my book. This particular Wegman's is fairly large and I found that they had a good selection of anything you may need. (In my case, it was TastyKakes, which are rarely seen on the West Coast.) The bakery and hot food sections are always where I spend most of my time, because who wouldn't want to grab snacks here? I found the staff here to be very helpful (as I was on a quest, I did have to ask where things were and no one ever seemed to be bothered by customer interruptions.) Pro-tips: use self checkout if you can and avoid the breakfast pizza (Corning's Wegman's wins over Ithaca's in this department.)
I'm living in Los Angeles now, and we could really use a Wegman's here. When I'm stuck in traffic, driving from store to store to find all of the ingredients I need, I remember that Ithaca - *Ithaca* of all places - had it all in one spot. Best food store ever. Whenever I come back to town, I visit here first before I go to Collegetown.

I really enjoy shopping at Wegmans because it is truly one stop shopping.  The produce and prepared food sections are especially great, and I love the gelato here.  It does get quite crowded, but I haven't found it unmanageable.
Hands down no contest...in Ithaca, there is no other better alternative.  Amazing quality and variety at a fair price.  What's so cool about Wegmans?  Well, how about the fresh juices and fruits?  How about the fill your own six pack variety microbrews? How about the bulk candy and snacks?  How about the gourmet meats?  Seriously, I could go on and on...but if you haven't been...please go and broaden your horizons.
Best grocery store ever!  You can find literally EVERYTHING here.  I was even able to satisfy my craving for styrian pumpkin seed oil.  It can be a bit pricey for some things, but the selection and quality more than make up for this.

This is an awesome super market.  You can find such a great variety and at really great prices!

Wegmans is the best place to buy groceries in Ithaca: better prices, selection, and quality than the competitors. Hands down. Delicious and reasonably-priced pre-made food. The company has a conscious too and will donate to local causes. Go Wegmans!
Since I love Wegmans so much, I decided to read the reviews here to see if others felt the same affection that I do for this truly exceptional grocery store chain. I was not surprised to see that the vast majority of reviews here are five stars, and I was also not surprised to find three negative reviews (since in my life's experience, there's always someone out there who isn't pleased with anything no matter what). To those negative reviewers, take note that the most recent Consumer Reports Magazine ranking of all supermarkets in the United States ranks Wegmans as the #1 supermarket chain of all major supermarket chains in the United States.  This is based on a recent survey completed by 27,208 Consumer Reports subscribers. This means that Wegmans trumps Trader Joes (which is owned by the same German family that owns those wonderful little Aldi stores that work their employees to death), Costco (a great company in their own right), Harris Teeter, etc.   Walmart was ranked #55, which is no great surprise since it is obvious that Walmart traditionally seems to consider it's customers the equivalent to cattle based on the cheap/tacky design of their stores, the prison-style restrooms, and how they treat their employees (and customers). I take some pride in this since I am a native "upstate" New Yorker, and Wegmans is an upstate New York-based company (as in Rochester, NY).  Hence, not everything of significance in the universe is started or located in large metro areas.   I have loved Wegmans since I was first introduced to the chain when I went to college at RIT in Rochester, NY thirty five years ago, and our love affair continues.
If you can't find it in Ithaca, chances are you can't find it in a grocery store in Ithaca. I love Wegmans for the produce, the wide variety in the international section, and the reasonable prices. Sometimes, though, I hate Wegmans for the parking lot and how crowded it gets. It's not their fault that they're busy, though, and they're good about keeping as many checkout lines open as they can staff. Don't go at peak hours--especially on weekends--and you'll have all the time and space you'll want to browse.

Wegmans scares me.  I've just moved out here from California and I have never been so overwhelmed by a grocery store. It was like the Super Walmart of Wholefoods.  Maybe someday at 2am I will get a craving for sushi and dog food, I'll go back to wegmans.
Just the best grocery store. ever. period. I live in NYC now, and just miss Wegmans so much!

Living in DC, I find myself yearning for the Wegmans back home whenever I try and go grocery shopping. It's always my first stop when I visit home.

As it was my first time ever setting foot at Wegmans let alone HEARD of this grocery store, it was understandable that I was quite apprehensive. However, on the drive there at a midnight shopping run with my brother who lived in Ithaca (he went to Cornell University) and my sister who was just as clueless as I was, he told me that it was open 24/7. Wait, what? That was awesome! :D When we arrived, my jaw dropped. This place was huge!! It reminded me of Whole Foods...but bigger. The size was quite capacious and honestly could have been a warehouse before they redid it. Just the bakery inside alone felt like a room in of itself. I was eyeing their muffins for a good ten minutes. bit.ly/1bCkp2S As my brother and his girlfriend went to buy some needed groceries, my sister and I trekked to the cheese 'aisle' -if it was even that. There were islands and walls surrounding us of this abundance! We were literally enclosed in a room of cheese!! Okay, both of us stayed in the cheese 'room' for a good half hour...or more. She left the area eventually getting a block of parmesan and brie. Still somewhat stuck near the cheese aisle, one thing stood out to me...QUARK! Oh my goodness. I've only seen quark in a few IG posts by some fellow health-nut IGers. Damn, one pint was a hefty six bucks though. bit.ly/15MIMp4 My sister and I managed to find our brother in this organic, farm-to-produce based....labyrinth of sorts. He was inspecting some gigantic bok choy. Whoa, I also saw some supersized veggies myself. bit.ly/18zfgXG Soon, both my siblings left with their purchases. My sister and I also left as Wegman-ers!! :D As we were driving back home on the highway, we spotted a Wegman truck. Immediately, we pointed at it and shouted, "WEGMANS!!" Yeah. definitely newly devout Wegman-ers.

My friends from home probably think I'm crazy because I always rave about Wegmans but it's just so great! I especially miss it since I've graduated and no longer live near one. 5 stars because Wegmans is clean and offers an amazing selection at reasonable prices. The employees who work there are friendly and helpful. I also love that Wegmans has a lot of higher quality, healthy offerings without charging the Whole Foods Price. Not to mention that Wegmans brand products are significantly better than other generic brand goods. Also, Wegmans has a prepared food section that is better than that of any other market that I've been to. I've actually chosen to have dinner there a few times instead of going out. I could go on and on..

Now that I'm no longer in Ithaca, I really miss shopping at Wegmans .The variety of products they have, especially Wegman brand, is fantastic. And their bakery serves up some of the best desserts I've ever had (try their fruit tart!). They also have a great hot buffet section. The staff at Wegmans are always willing to help. I've never had a bad experience there when it came to customer service. Wegmans pretty much has anything you want. The place is huge and their food is fresh. I would highly recommend shopping here and it's open late!

Holy crap this place is amazing. This place is at least twice the size of all the supermarkets back home, and their selection is so much greater, the food is higher quality, and the store is so well organized. Wegmans has its own brand of products on the shelves which are definitely a lot cheaper without sacrificing quality. But if you're a fan of the more common brands, they'll have those available too. They have an aisle for foods from Asia, including Asian snacks that I was worried I wouldn't find in upstate New York. Employees are very friendly and will help you find whatever you need, which is great since the store is so big and locating what you want may lead to some wandering. I haven't had any problems with the staff at all yet. I was worried living in the middle of nowhere would mean I would have very limited options in what I could get at a grocery store. Thank you Wegmans for your existence.

I'm not a frequent grocery store goer, but I don't think there is a grocery store like this in the West Coast. They have everything here. Delis for vegetarian, Mediterranean, Asian, and almost all others. Pharmacy, dry cleaners, flower shop, bakery, candy store, and on and on and on! The store is nice and clean. I tried Crab chowder and Cheese plate. The food was delicious and restaurant quality. Will stop by here again before leaving the town.
Dear Wegmans, Every time I enter you, I can't leave. You're a layover from my college days and though I hadn't stepped foot inside your cavernous space in almost 20 years, when I revisited you this past weekend, it was like seeing an old friend.  You're still the same in many ways: aisles upon aisles of choice, sometimes too much choice, but I won't have it any other way. And your Market Cafe. Well, now I can shop for groceries and pick up dinner too.  Your $6 and $10 meals are as delicious as they look (the honey-brined fried chicken turned me into a believer). Your Vegan, Asian, BBQ and Subs section give me reason to never order take out again. Holy crap - you have a Dim Sum station! And now I want shrimp shumai. Wegmans, all I ask is that you make your way down here.  New York City and Westchester need you to come on down and give Whole Foods some much needed competition.

This Wegman's is a good store, but I don't understand why people hype it up as practically an Ithaca landmark. The layout of the products doesn't seem very efficient to me.  I find myself walking all over trying to find stuff. The one thing I really do like are the individually wrapped meats which are great when I need to cook just one piece at a time.

Delis for vegetarian, Mediterranean, Asian, and almost all others. Pharmacy, dry cleaners, flower shop, bakery, candy store, and on and on and on! The store is nice and clean. I tried Crab chowder and Cheese plate. The food was delicious and restaurant quality. Will stop by here again before leaving the town.
Came here yesterday with only 30 minutes to shop (supermarket sweep anyone?) and I was SO overwhelmed! They have so many different sections and an awesome selection. I definitely didn't have enough time to search through it all. And I am definitely not used to the layout (couldn't find tortillassss nooooo!). I could probably get lost here.
Dear Wegmans, Every time I enter you, I can't leave. You're a layover from my college days and though I hadn't stepped foot inside your cavernous space in almost 20 years, when I revisited you this past weekend, it was like seeing an old friend.  You're still the same in many ways: aisles upon aisles of choice, sometimes too much choice, but I won't have it any other way. And your Market Cafe. Well, now I can shop for groceries and pick up dinner too.  Your $6 and $10 meals are as delicious as they look (the honey-brined fried chicken turned me into a believer). Your Vegan, Asian, BBQ and Subs section give me reason to never order take out again. Holy crap - you have a Dim Sum station! And now I want shrimp shumai. Wegmans, all I ask is that you make your way down here.  New York City and Westchester need you to come on down and give Whole Foods some much needed competition.
This Wegman's is a good store, but I don't understand why people hype it up as practically an Ithaca landmark. The layout of the products doesn't seem very efficient to me.  I find myself walking all over trying to find stuff. The one thing I really do like are the individually wrapped meats which are great when I need to cook just one piece at a time.
If you've ever been in Oakland (Chokeland), then you've likely seen those billboards that ask "Can you name 5 types of apples?" I pass the test not only because I used to pick apples, but also because Wegmans sells at least ten varieties of apples. McIntosh, Granny Smith, Gala, Fuji, Pacific Rose, Red Delicious, Braeburn, Cortland, Honeycrisp, Jazz, King, Pink Lady, Golden Delicious, etc. I swear I didn't look this up online! Much of Oakland is a food desert because Wegmans doesn't exist in Oakland. Just kidding: the issue of food security is more complex than this simplification. Wegmans has so many ready-to-eat foods that are homemade. They taste better than my meals. They rival Chez Panisse. Oh wait Chez Panisse is closed due to a fire. Too soon? Wegmans is simply amazing. Their cuts of fish and meat are unrivaled in this little town. Ithaca is gorges!

Whenever I go home, my husband cringes about the fact I may drag him to Wegman's multiple times a day. This may have been because when we were in Ithaca for a wedding, it might have been the case. What can I say, I love this place, and so did all of the wedding guests. Dear Wegmans, how I love thee, let me talk about your cheese puffs, or the damned lemon Italian cookies I can not seem to find anywhere else!!! The pizza is yummy, but watch out, cause Mark's Pizza is going to kick your tushy. The lamb loins that I again, can not find elsewhere, are so delicate and yummy!! Do you sometime charge more for things, yeah, but I understand it. Do I wish that I could get a potion of the items you sell out in Minnesota, you better believe it!

Wegmans....you are slowly causing me a slow death because your 14" subs are just too amazing. Everything bread on your sub is a recipe for disaster....because once you have it there IS no other bread! Wegmans subs are my 2nd favorite subs in the world. I could eat these everyday! The amount of meat, cheese and veggies they put on is crazy and the price can NOT be beat. The only subs better than wegmans is DiBella's but seeing as the closest one is a few hours away this is my favorite place in Ithaca and I usually go here at least 2-3 times a month. Wegmans, keep on keeping on and making great subs! You continue to be amazing!

My favorite grocery store, ever.  I would move to Ithaca just so I could go to Wegmans every week. Awesome selection of anything you need with great prices (and top-notch store brands), and the store is kept cleaner than a hospital. The sub shop makes Subway and Quiznos cry.  Highly recommended for lunch or dinner.

Great supermarket with a great variety of food. The Latin american food is surprisingly decent for being in the middle of upstate New York. I also very much appreciate the fact the extent the employees will attempt to answer any questions you have. There was one instance in which the employee did not know the location of an item and immediately made a phone call to locate it, absolutely great. One issue is that if you go during the weekdays at night, the employees tend to not be as helpful which is why it is receiving 4 stars as opposed to 5.

Greatest food EVER!!! Good prices and quality.  Great college atmosphere.  Best pizza, salad, sushi, and subs!  The muffins are AMAZING!!!!!

It's funny how time  s e e m s   t o   s l o w   d  o  w  n    a  t    W    e    g    m    a    n     s. Somehow, our "quick pitstop to pick up vittles" turned into a two-hour extravaganza of seek and destroy (where "destroy" equals "toss into our grocery cart") our laundry list of breakfast and dinner ingredients.   Now, I've spent many an hour at Wegmans before.  I muchly adore the chain.  Still, it seems to me that you don't really get to experience Wegmans unless you're close to the heart of their origin, and in this case, exploring the Ithaca store with friends was like amping up the experience of going grocery-shopping back in NoVA. For starters, this store has a way more enormous organic section.  It certainly made hunting down Annie's goddess dressing more challenging, since it's located over here, and not with the rest of the salad dressings in an aisle on the other end of the store. Perhaps, most excitingly, the beer selection at this Wegmans is immense!  I've never encountered any grocery that carries so many varieties of Unibroue beer, including at least Éphémère, Blanche De Chambly, and La Fin Du Monde.  Obviously, I scored a four-pack of both the Blanche de Chambly and the Fin Du Monde.  Plus at least three other six-packs.  What do you expect when you're spending a weekend sitting on a dock on Cayuga Lake with friends on July 4th weekend, anyway? Dear Wegmans, thanks for being an enabler.  Of enormous and delicious homemade breakfasts, of ridiculous grilled steak dinners, of boozing and wenching in a canoe or on the shore, and most importantly of all perhaps, of memorable times with the special people in one's life.
Do I really need to say something about this place? Really?? 24/7? Check. $6 meals with two sides and the entree for all-American food? Check. Korean condiments, pre-packaged and processed meals when I crave trashy Korean food? Check. Concealer? Check. Aluminum foil to maintain my blue-streaked hair? Check Flowers to pretty up my room? Check. LOADED WITH GOODIES? Check. Cheap as hell? Check. Plus. I'm going to be a fangirl and proclaim: I (HEART) WEGMANS!

Dearest Wegmans, I miss our 4AM visits when we didn't want to go to sleep or needed a caffeine fix during our all night studying sessions. I miss the crotchety old women following me out to my car if I was purchasing alcoholic beverages to make sure I didn't have any youngsters with me. I miss the fresh cut flowers that put even my florist mother to shame. I miss the smelly cheeses I could sample to my hearts content... I miss shopping cart races in the parking lot. I love that when my roommate had knee surgery, she could get one of those cool automated shopping carts... and the store people let me drive around in one as well since she felt so self conscious. Nothing can ever compare to my first love of Wegmans... wish I had you near me.

Whenever I visit family in Rochester we take the ritualistic trip to Wegman's to stock up on lox, cream cheese, and bagels but primarily just to roam the aisles in awe.  This is my first time in the Ithaca Wegmans though.  Less of a spectacle but still somehow even more chaotic than Rochester and yet  still housing an incredible selection of food items. Things that set Wegmans apart from most other local or regional grocery stores I've been to (across the world):  massive organic section, incredible beer selection including aisle divisions by region (e.g. German, Belgian, East Coast Micro, West Coast Micro, etc.) and a large walk-in beer fridge, *amazing* NY style bagels baked fresh, ginormous seafood and fresh deli, and hard to find specialty cheeses.  No more expensive than any other grocery store in the US and they seem to have great specials on local produce (organic too!).   And the service??  Tall Mike knows how to pack 'em right -- we didn't even have to ask him to put our mussels in a plastic bag and he carefully arranged the fresh basil so that it didn't get crushed by any rogue items.   Alas, off I go to the land of ghetto Ralph's & Stater Brothers.

Wegmans is probably the best grocery store I've ever been to, and the one in downtown Ithaca is the most amazing of the chain. They built a new store back in 1998, or so, and it includes things you won't find in almost any other super grocery store. The crown jewel is the giant wood-fired bread oven, heated to 400 degrees and likely to stay at that temp for its entire 100 service life. Their breads are fantastic, and thats only one small portion of the store. We used to head down to Wegmans to study if the libraries at Cornell weren't cutting it - you could grab some coffee, a bagel, and a table near the front of the store. Can't beat that. On top of everything else their prices are also very reasonable. We would regularly pick up 5 or 10 lbs of pasta for $.25 / pound. Does a (college-aged) body right! Oh yeah, Wegmans is also consistently ranked highly in Forbe's top 100 companies to work for, so you know they treat their employees right.

I, like so many, miss you Wegmans. My heart aches and my tummy rumbles when I think of your: 1. Olive/ Mediterranean Bar, with such diversity and freshness in one spot I could easily fill up for a week straight 2. edemame salad: a golden child amongst the med bar options 3. Wegmans brand seafood cocktail sauce. So much better than the rest. I mean that. 4. pasta bar, in particular the Red Pepper Pesto sauce, with all the fixings. 5. candy isle and the jelly belly jelly bean selection. Tangerine jelly bellies by the bag full?... available 24 hours a day? Ingenious. 6. individually wrapped Choc Chip cookies (w/ walnuts) that you conveniently sell at the cafe registers... so. darn. good. Life would be better with a Wegmans in the boston area. While I won't hold my breath for a grand opening anytime soon, a girl can dream, and dream I will.

As a chef, I have to admit that I LOVE grocery shopping. I know most people think of it as a chore, and it can be, if its in a crappy grocery store. Not at Wegmans. Every shopping trip feels like an adventure here. I am a transplant to Ithaca from the Midwest, where most grocery stores (not farmers markets) are set up like a walmart. There is nothing out of the ordinary and there's no cafes (unless you count the mcdonalds set up in some walmarts) and there usually isn't an organic option for most foods, or a decent tasting store brand. Wegmans not only carries organic versions of a lot of products, but also their generic store brand tastes great, if not better,than many national brands. Hot food bars are always a good place to get some lunch or pick up a quick side for dinner. I love Wegmans. I will NEVER grocery shop anywhere else.

My Wegmans good list: 1) The Sandwich. I bet you can't, nor should you even attempt to, eat the 14 incher by yourself. The other restaurant thingies are very good as well - the pasta and soups are excellent - but that sandwich is a thing of beauty. 2) Olive Bar. The humus. is. the. best. 3) The beer aisle is second only to Finger Lakes Beverage Center for quality and variety. Wegmans has definitely stolen most of my beer business from the Beverage Center. 4) I believe they are the only place in town the carries Nathan's Hot Dogs. 5) Bakery. The girlfriend cannot even walk past it without getting sucked in. They make this pumpkin drop cake with cream cheesy icing thing and ... My Wegmans bad list: 1) Produce. I honestly don't think there is anything special about the produce in general and I'm usually disappointed with the fruit. I don't avoid it, but I'd just as soon get produce at the Tops next door. Sure they have a huge selection, but its not always top notch IMO. 2) Chaos - its hard to come any time of the weekend and week days can be almost as bad. Midnight shopping is recommended. 3) The asian bar, like all pay-by-the-pound bars, is a rip off. I guess the food is good enough, but its easy to blow $10-12 on what you thought was a snack. 4) No self-check out. Get with the times wegmans. I reserve the right to amend these lists at any time.
Too much plastic litters all around the premise. I think a grocery stores as large as Wegmans who sell their foods in plastic bags and packages should roll out dramatic anti-littering campaigns for the community and not be active part of the problem.  I bought the pastries and saw those plastic "papers" to pick them up and wondered why plastic (they tried to make me think "green" by calling it recycled but when I saw the same "paper," like three of them, blowing in the wind, I wondered how is Wegmans going to be responsible for the plastics that do not decompose and go into streams and waterways.  I picked up so much litters (plastic bags and plastic bottles) around the premise (like, some 20 of them .. then I put them in a trash bin ... but after I shopped and I came out, there were more! Unbelievable!  Plastic bags are often blown into shrubs but you could also see them swimming in front of you as they are blown away in wind, traveling together on the road with trucks. I think when you walk you see more, when you drive, you are much more insensitive.  We are destroying the planet. People should watch a documentary film called "Bag It" and others. Com'on, this is not funny at all!  I'm not joking!  Littering is epidemic. Humans are the cancer of the planet. Horrible! Wegmans should be proactive in stop using plastic bags at their stores. I can't tell you how often I come across with their bags on the street - maybe proportionate to the amount of litter with the store name, they should pay for cleanup funds for local waste management facility. I'm tired of it.

Mr. Wegman.....I know your friends with Mr Butt but why don't you teach Mr Butt about European flair and incredible cheese departments and fresh baked breads....and for goodness sake please...teach Mr Butt that a donut is NOT a PASTRY!!!!!!!!!  Thanks Danny Wegman....tell him now so we imported Texans can have our Upstate NY fix.

What is not to love about Wegmans?  Great produce, an amazing deli, a fantastic bakery, a classy mini food court with fresh and tasty food, and nearly any kind of specialty food the average Ithacan, non-native, or adventurous eater desires.  Did I mention there's an entire back area devoted to nothing but CANDY?  It's like the Disneyland of grocery stores (and thus the perfect place to play The Wegmans Game).  And much like the land of Disney, this place is frequently crowded.  Never go between 4 and 7 on a weeknight, and never go on Saturday or Sunday until later in the evening--too many people!   The only downside to good old Weggies is that it can be a little pricey.  I tended to do my produce shopping here and get everything else at P&C or someplace else.

Wegmans saved my life tonight. After an exhausting day in the ER I was able to get a nutritious delicious dinner at the prepared dinners deli and a Wings of Life Salad. Thank you for being there!!!!!

I think I pray for a Wegmans in Atlanta at least once a week. This Wegmans may not be far superior to all other Wegmans but it will always hold a special place in my heart.  From the talking trash cans to the amazing seasonal isle to the great natural products all the way to the awesome booze selection. And it's nice to know that even when I'm 40, if I'm buying booze at this Wegman's, I'll still get carded.  Love of all loves.

Overpriced, bad seafood selection, hard to find things ie disorganized.  I spent a month in Ithaca NY and did all the cooking using in-law's kitchen.  I'm from Bay Area ie Mountain View CA and we have lots of market possibilities from overpriced Whole Foods to to economical Trader Joe's and plenty of farmer's market types like Milk Pail which are very inexpensive farm to market produce.   Although Wegman's produce area is brimming with many fresh veggies and fruits, they were quite expensive and were certainly lacking in Asian produce.  Dinky little daikon looking like overweight  carrots.   This store needs competition like Trader Joe's, Sprouts and other produce, seafood, and Asian oriented grocery store(s). I do not buy prepared foods so I've no idea if good or bad but I did check out their makizushi ie rolled sushi selection.  I would not buy.

This is maybe the 5th Wegmans that we've visted.  While I'm not prepared to bash them I will say that the layout of this store is a little confusing.  All the great sh*t that you've come to expect from Weggies is still in there, some of it is just a little bit hard to find. We always seem to find a boat load of things that we didn't really need while wandering around the store.  This means we usually spend twice as much as intended.  This latest trip was no different.

Awww...Weggies!!! I loved coming to shop here anytime 24 hrs (perfect for you studying insomniacs) after getting my car and not having to take the bus to buy groceries at Tops. You can practically get every cooking ingredient imaginable here! I would watch all these episodes of Food Network and next thing you know I'm spending $75 trying to make something I saw Rachael Ray made. The meat and seafood selections are plentiful and fresh, as well as the bakery (lots of items from desserts to bread) and sushi station (come here during the day for fresh above items). And of course, they have what I miss most now: Upstate NY apple cider :-) Their prices are reasonable as well, not like evil empire Whole Foods (see my review of them). So enjoy and better yet, take your date to stroll along the aisles (produce and bakery sections are romantic, don't you know?) and start cooking and eating!

4 and half stars and rising. Their prepared foods ARE restaurant quality and not by accident. They just began serving steamed Dim Sum and you just don't find thiis quality in Big Box stores ..........until now. It was $8.49 a pound. They have the Soup Dumplings, Hargow, Shumai, but they also make some with Scallops that were large and so darn good. I also had a large cup of their Rotisserie Chicken Soup that complimented the Dim Sum just right. Who woulda thought? The Ithica store is close to Cornell University, and has everything.

Wegman's is the perfect supermarket.  It has everything you could ever want including a killer deli featuring one of the finest sub sandwiches anywhere.   I was craving a Danny's Favorite - Genoa salami, capicola and spicy ham - for nearly six years so we had to save ourselves despite all the incredible looking goodies at the Farmer's Market.  I'm glad we did because it was even better than I had remembered.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.   The wife's ten-year reunion isn't for another four years.  How the heck am I going to last that long without a Wegman's nearby?

I don't know what gets me more excited to come visit Ithaca. Seeing my family or getting to go to Wegmans. Hmmmm...once the family starts squabbling, definitely Wegmans. This store is amazing and has set the bar for other grocery stores HIGH! I love the bulk section, the amazing cheese area, the olive bar and I could go on and on. If you haven't been-find one and make a visit. Save room for a delicious sub or wings of  life salad.

Best grocery store in Ithaca bar none. Anything and everything you can think of can be had here, from fresh veggies and meat to the best beer and cheese selection to be had within a hundred miles. The only downside is how far they are from campus. Well worth the trek though.

Wegmans is the Mount Olympus of grocery stores. When my mentor was recommending Ithaca College, did I get tips on the professors? No. Did I get advice for the high school grad? Nope! My advice was "GO TO WEGMANS." And so I did, and was converted. This place is _massive_with the hugest cheese and deli section I've seen outside of Harrod's of London. I also survived on their buffet lines, which are as meticulously maintained as any in a real restaurant and a thousands times better. I got everything here, and best of all, even a starving college student can afford it. With the wood-burning oven, upstairs cafe (for their cooking classes!), limitless staffed cases of unique foods and the best decor I've seen outside of HGTV, Wegmans is a must for any person remotely close to Ithaca.

Best.  Grocery.  Store.  Ever. So much more than just a grocery store!  Open 24 hours a day, with everything you could ever want....Cant' be beat.

Down on Long Island they have some upscale food markets, some ethnic groceries, cafes and a few good bakeries. Combine one of each under one roof, add a great ambiance, friendly staff, and reasonable prices, and you _might_ have Wegmans. Wegmans is, quite simply, the Queen Mother of supermarkets. (Or maybe the Chuck Norris of supermarkets?) It's also one of the few 24-hour joints in Ithaca worth frequenting. I miss very few things about Ithaca - Wegmans is near the top of the short list. I still have my Shoppers Club card somewhere; I hope to find it if ever they expand downstate. Alas, they've overshot us and gone straight to central Jersey.

Sweet Mamma Jamma!  I never thought I could LOVE a grocery store, but I'm pretty sure that I loved Wegmans.  I miss it at least once/week.  The grocery section has everything you need, including a litany of artisan cheeses and a huge walk-in beer cooler.  The produce is always fresh, and its variety unparalleled anywhere else in Ithaca.  Every so often they even have truffles, which are ludicrously expensive, as you would expect.  The grocery section is open 24 hours, perfect for college students with wacky hours. My favorite part of Wegmans was the cafe.  When I first came to the cafe, I ordered from the pasta bar.  You can choose from a selection of noodles, add a few kinds of meat, shrimp and vegetables and top it all off with marinara, pesto or alfredo sauce.  Plus they'll throw in some olive oil and white wine if you like, as well as a number of different seasonings.  Then they cook it right in front of you and it takes about 4 minutes.  A "full order" will leave you with plenty to save for later. Eventually, I discovered the Carving Board, where they will craft a fresh hot sandwich of real turkey or real roast beef for you.  The slice up the meat in front of you and stick it on a fresh-baked roll, which they'll dip in au-jus if you so desire (I did).  I recommend the roast beef.  The sandwiches are $5.99 and for $7.99 you can get a combo meal, with a soda and fries, onion rings or soup.  I say, go with the fries; they are delicious and they cook each order while you wait (apx 2 min).

I miss you. I love you. I wish you'd move West.

This SUPERmarket is hands down, the BEST thing about Ithaca.  I love it so much that I brave the 2 hour bus trip (round trip) from North Campus of Cornell to Wegmans!  That is really saying something because I value my time greatly. I have only been here 3-4 times though so I still get lost inside of this huge store.   Some especially notable sections of this market include the great vegan/vegetarian section, affordable meat department, huge produce department, and prepared foods bar.  I like the Wegmans brand items because they are well-priced and tasty products as well.   I greatly value (and expect) good customer service, and the employees at the cash register are nice, friendly, and on top of their job.  I am comparing this to Tops, where the cashiers are spacey and always seem to forget that I give them reusable bags, so I have to transfer over my own groceries.  I actually like packing my own bags though, it reminds me of when I was a child and liked to pretend I worked at the market. I love grocery shopping (I think it's a hobby of mine), and I love Wegmans.  Great food and great prices.

I wish we had one in Cortland! The food court area is awesome! Just about anything you could want. Try the Spicy Shrimp Roll in the sushi area.
Wegman's was the shiznit when I first went to IC, and that was back in '91 when it was only the old store. Apparently the powers that be later saw fit to tear that one down and build a new one the size of a sports arena. It will blow your mind. It often confuses me when I go back to visit. The cafe in the front is insanely great. Want pizza, sushi, subs, vegetarian food, hot meals, fresh fish, deli meats, baked goods, cheese, or anything else? It's there, along with a dining room to eat it in. Also, have to love the Woo-Pop (their own in house line of soda). I can't confirm whether this is still the case, but Wegman's was also a popular college destination because their ATMs dispensed cash in $5 increments. When you had less than $10 in your checking account, you could still get cash.

My feelings about Wegman's depend mainly on three things: - It stocks my favourite brand of hot chocolate (Dagoba xocolatl) - It's a challenge to get to (a half-hour walk, out of the question when it snows) - For proximity's sake I shop at P&C, whose selection of fly-addled fruit and Little Debbie "snacks" casts Wegman's in an all-but-Olympian light

Don't get me wrong, I do heart the Wiggity Weg but lately it's nearly impossible to shop there at a reasonable hour.  It seems like everyone from Ithaca and the surrounding towns is in Wegmans during lunch and after work.  The parking lot and store are overcrowded, the checkout lines can be long, there's traffic in the aisles, it is stressful to shop there.   And because so many people are shopping there at once, they are often out of or low on certain items. They have a great selection of food but they need to open a second store up the hill like Tops and P&C so I can shop there at a time other than 2am.

Gotta love Wegmans.  High quality foods, large selection, amazingly helpful staff!

Far and away the most classy large grocery store in Ithaca. This is not a cheap store, though they do have lower end items also. There is no close 2nd. The store is large, great visual experience Salad,  Soup pre prepared hot food items. Lot's of cheeses.

Ohmygoodness, Wegmans. I love you SO DANG MUCH. Is it possible to fall head over heels for a grocery store? I think so, yes. If Whole Foods and Trader Joe's had a baby with a regular grocery store and a fairy sprinkled it with magic awesome dust, the result would be Wegmans. My only complaint is that everyone else loves it too (oh Wegmans, you cad). The store can be more packed than a can of sardines on the weekends, but they try their darndest to restock popular items as soon as they start running low. Just grab one of the small, more maneuverable carts and bring a leash for your husband, because he will inevitably wander away and never return. Wegmans is the best grocery option in Ithaca by leaps and bounds: the freshest produce, widest selection, and best prices. The staff is friendly and approachable, and the store is clean. Their brand of products is better than any other grocery-brand I've ever tried. Not only is it less expensive than the name-brands on the shelf next to it, but  some of the Wegmans products honestly taste better. It's a win-win! The bulk section is A-MA-ZING, both in terms of price and selection--seriously, they stock every kind of spice, grain, dried fruit, nut, candy, etc. that you could ever possibly need. The international section also has a great variety of typically-hard-to-find items. Missing Whole Foods? Their extensive organic/natural section has you covered. And my husband raves about the selection of beer at Wegmans (now if only New York would allow you to buy wine in the grocery store...I'd never have to shop anywhere else!). I've made the "mistake" (mwahaha) of going to Wegmans when I'm hungry, just as an excuse to munch on something from the prepared foods section while I shop. No matter the craving, the food court has you covered. I could gladly live in there for the rest of my life, but they'd have to kick me out for drooling on everything all the time.
Great selection of produce and New York products. I also love the hot food area -- lots of fresh veggies as well as foods of all varieties.

I remember first walking into this store. I checked out the natural section, as I always do. Eventually I found my way to the back of the store and found a little train going 'round a huge selection of candies and nuts. I was in heaven. Wegmans is clean, open 24/7, has very good prices, great produce (not sad, floppy looking veggies), and most importantly, the employees don't look like they would rather shoot themselves in the foot than scan my groceries. They have a great vegan selection, which is my primary concern. Best of all Wegmans has easy to read symbols on all of the Wegmans brand items making it extremely easy for vegans (and gluten free) people to pick out items. The only downside? Any time before 9pm at Wegmans reminds me of Disney World during Spring Break. Quick solution: Shop at 1am, of course.

I miss Wegmans so much after moving from upstate New York.  It literally has everything from fresh meat to local vegetables to special products like vegan and gluten-free. According to my friends, Wegmans is the "food disneyland". I have never been to any supermarkets that has a better reputation than Wegmans. My personal favorites from Wegmans are the pre-clean and pre-cut vegetables.  They are always of good quality and easy to use, making them a great time-saver for college students like me.  I also cannot stress enough how much I appreciate their specialty aisles and their great labeling system.  They make life so much easier for people with allergies and people who follow a special diet. Better yet, Wegmans is not only a grocery store because their cooked food section (some places have food bars) is one of the best.  I would drive to Wegmans just to get their packaged sushi!

I LOVE WEGMANS! The best grocery store ever! Every time I come to visit Ithaca, Wegmans is the first place I go, and the last place I visit!!!! This is your super grocery store with everything you ever need.. from pharmacy, to coffee, to produce, to hot food, name it and Wegmans probably has it. This is a place where the owners really care about their products and customers.  It is well maintained and well thought-out. Thank you for providing quality service and products for so many years.  Please continue to ensure the quality of your stores! I will be a loyal customer forever!

Yay! I effing love this place. It's huge and has pretty much everything, including a pretty extensive selection of international food and ingredients. It's open 24/7 which is perfect for college students. My roomies and I used to trek here after midnight, which meant parking close to the store and not having to worry about shopping cart traffic inside. Late night shopping made it so easy to grab stuff quicker and that meant cashier lines were short too. I love the bakery bread. I used to grab a loaf and pick at it while shopping. I also love the per-pound buffet area (with normal American fare as well as some Chinese food) and the pasta station and the sandwich station. There's a seating area upstairs for you to sit and eat. And I've seen flyers for cooking classes (though I've never been) but they looked fun. Remember to sign up for a card so you can get the frequent shopper discounts on sale items or whatever. If you don't have one though, you can always just tell your cashier you forgot it and they can just work their magic and do it for you. Prices are reasonable; on par with normal suburban grocery prices (or at least from what I've experienced). It's always nice to look for sales though and if you're trying to save, Wegmans brand things are always the cheapest. I especially love their cheap looking cereal boxes - I say cheap because they used a poor version of photoshop or something to make a solid color gradient background behind the bowl of cereal. Love this place.

Dude, who doesn't love Wegmans. 24/7, great grocery selection and produce straight from local farmers, plus other miscellaneous supplies you would normally only be able to get from Walmart. I go here all the time for groceries, HUGE SELECTION. I am a huge Whole Foods fan, and this is probably the closest thing in the area in terms of quality food, selection, and size. Their food court/buffet lines are awesome. Wegmans also has a place where they make custom ordered pasta or even cook a steak you picked off their meat section. The granola, candy, and nuts section in the back is a nice commodity. I love snacking on granola and nuts so you can get a huge bag of them and pay by the pound. I try to look away from the candy section while I weigh my bags, it makes me too sad. I'd probably sample everything (even though they tell you not to, haha) and die from sugar overload if I bought candy there. Sometimes, it's just fun to go on Wegmans runs with your college friends. Some nights, when there's absolutely nothing to do, we just say, "Hey let's go to Wegs" and end up spending like two hours there. Only God knows how. Wow, I wonder what I do there... Service is also amazing. All the employees are so knowledgable and friendly. I LOVE WEGMANS AGHAIGHAIH.

This is a place where the owners really care about their products and customers.  It is well maintained and well thought-out. Thank you for providing quality service and products for so many years.  Please continue to ensure the quality of your stores! I will be a loyal customer forever!
WOW. Amazing. Too busy to yelp much but I had to write about this. Wegmans reminds me of whole foods! Whole foods is still number one to me but Wegmans is the best around here. PLUS they have hemp milk! Which is pretty rare to find I think AND its cheaper than the price I pay at whole foods for the same hemp milk! Definitely a vegan friendly supermarket. Overall, the prices are decent; much cheaper then the others and they have good deals! I'm not in Ithaca but I travel the 15+ miles just to come here for my groceries. Which means you gota check it out! Premade food is available! Looks so yummy =D And an isle of books and magazines - lots of people stand here reading, I'm guilty to be one of them. =x OPEN 24/7!! Does it get any better?
Yay! I effing love this place. It's huge and has pretty much everything, including a pretty extensive selection of international food and ingredients. It's open 24/7 which is perfect for college students. My roomies and I used to trek here after midnight, which meant parking close to the store and not having to worry about shopping cart traffic inside. Late night shopping made it so easy to grab stuff quicker and that meant cashier lines were short too. I love the bakery bread. I used to grab a loaf and pick at it while shopping. I also love the per-pound buffet area (with normal American fare as well as some Chinese food) and the pasta station and the sandwich station. There's a seating area upstairs for you to sit and eat. And I've seen flyers for cooking classes (though I've never been) but they looked fun. Remember to sign up for a card so you can get the frequent shopper discounts on sale items or whatever. If you don't have one though, you can always just tell your cashier you forgot it and they can just work their magic and do it for you. Prices are reasonable; on par with normal suburban grocery prices (or at least from what I've experienced). It's always nice to look for sales though and if you're trying to save, Wegmans brand things are always the cheapest. I especially love their cheap looking cereal boxes - I say cheap because they used a poor version of photoshop or something to make a solid color gradient background behind the bowl of cereal. Love this place.
AMAZING! Fresh food, wide variety, beautiful store. Love the buffet with ethnic foods! I'm not in Ithaca anymore, but I still miss Wegman's.
Dude, who doesn't love Wegmans. 24/7, great grocery selection and produce straight from local farmers, plus other miscellaneous supplies you would normally only be able to get from Walmart. I go here all the time for groceries, HUGE SELECTION. I am a huge Whole Foods fan, and this is probably the closest thing in the area in terms of quality food, selection, and size. Their food court/buffet lines are awesome. Wegmans also has a place where they make custom ordered pasta or even cook a steak you picked off their meat section. The granola, candy, and nuts section in the back is a nice commodity. I love snacking on granola and nuts so you can get a huge bag of them and pay by the pound. I try to look away from the candy section while I weigh my bags, it makes me too sad. I'd probably sample everything (even though they tell you not to, haha) and die from sugar overload if I bought candy there. Sometimes, it's just fun to go on Wegmans runs with your college friends. Some nights, when there's absolutely nothing to do, we just say, "Hey let's go to Wegs" and end up spending like two hours there. Only God knows how. Wow, I wonder what I do there... Service is also amazing. All the employees are so knowledgable and friendly. I LOVE WEGMANS AGHAIGHAIH.
This place could be heaven on Earth. It literally destroys every other supermarket, and most restaurants, in the Ithaca area. Wegmans offers the finest quality ingredients for good prices. They also carry name brands unlike Whole Foods. I could eat every meal here and be happy. Nothing is better than the main course and 2 sides for $6.

Best grocery store I've ever been to, hands down. I cannot believe this place has not come to Massachusetts and sorely miss everything about it. Out of my two days visiting the area, I had to come back to Wegmans twice and it was never, never enough. I cannot believe that it is open all day, 24/7. The amount of foods offered and served are absolutely insane and I really, really miss the chai latte at the breakfast bar(!). Wegmans, you are awesome and the only reason why I am taking one star off your rating is because you forgot to put my cheese in my egg and cheese sandwich. Despite that mishap, I will see no wrong in you and am now your devoted fan. Now, to find a way back...
Great food store.  The cafe had some of the best chicken fingers(tenders) I have had in awhile.  Watch out for the bakery - it has lots of stuff that will increase your diameter. The Wegmans brand dark chocolate ice cream was good too. Big selection of beer and tea also. It's also a very well stocked supermarket.

I miss upstate NY, I now live in Brooklyn. One of the things I miss most? Wegmans, especially the bakery/prepared sections. Ugh. :[ 5 stars, best place ever. I'll see you soon. Less than three.

I was going to write EXACTLY what Alex G wrote, down to the family-part. Living in Boston I have to go to the Whole Foods in one neighborhood, the regular supermarket for sundries, the cheese vendor in another neighborhood, the Halal butcher for the good lamb, Savenor's for the really specialty stuff and the beer at yet another place. At "Weggies" it's all there. One place! ***swoon*** I'm doing a little dance right now just thinking of the place!

Very convenient store, open 24H, and staff is very helpful. Although the fruits are a little expensive, the meats are very reasonably priced, and like all the other Wegmans, you can really find everything you need.

people in Ithaca LOVE Wegmans! They talk about it all the time. To me a metropolitan, their comments make me a little underwhilemed. But they do have the most fresh vegetables and fruits in the town, fresh made meals at reasonable price, and they catch up the fashions in consumer foods well. So not much complain about it. One more thing: they are always trying to make a more ergonomic working environment for their staff, like adjusting the height of tables for pastry worker; pushing their vendors to print bar codes on all sides of the goods so the staffs don't need to lift them when scanning... shows they are a caring employer. So one more start for them!

This place is a gigantic step above the other options in Ithaca, Tops and P and C. The prices are definitely higher, but it's worth it. For me, the best part of Wegmans: cheap bulk candy, but they have a huge selection of anything and everything. Also, Wegmans is open 24 hours; so I would just take the Ithaca Carshare at night when the fees are cheaper and shop to my heart's content. Warning: One note for late night shopping is that the store usually restocks then so you might miss out on some items. Also, no one is manning the counters then so no counter meats or seafood.

I love, love, love Wegmans.  I know, that sounds sort of pathetic, but it's true.  Let's face it -- grocery shopping is a *chore*, but Wegmans makes it about as fun as it can be. The food product selection is amazing (there must be 300 varieties of cheese alone) and the prices are not bad at all, certainly no worse than I've seen at far inferior supermarkets.  They appear to have week-in-week-out rock-bottom pricing on certain staples (milk, eggs, butter, bread) as well, though perhaps we've just been lucky. Wegmans is perhaps not the best place for non-grocery items, though.  I wanted aluminum foil one time and was kind of surprised at how few options there were (I don't think that there was a store brand, for example) but that's a minor quibble.  All in all, Wegmans is the best supermarket I've ever had occasion to shop in.

This is an excellent supermarket for many reasons.  Several of them are listed below...   1) The prepared foods section has food that is actually better than the food found in the vast majority of upstate NY restaurants. 2) Prices are really REALLY good in this store. 3) They have self-service checkouts so you do not have to deal with cashiers (though when I have dealt with cashiers in the past they are generally friendly). 4) Great range of a variety of things... lots of Latino food selection (Goya products, etc), healthy foods, protein supplements, etc. 5) Open 24/7... kind of shocking for a town where most people seem to call it a night around dusk. 6) Big parking lot, so you can always find a space without having to wait in line (even when it is busy). There is no other supermarket I would go to in Ithaca.

My favorite grocery ever.  I wish I still lived in ITH just so I could still go to Wegmans.

This is a great grocery store. They have a very good selection of ethnic ingredients, prepared food, cheeses, meats and seafood. Their bakery is amazing, especially their chocolate ganache cakes. Unfortunately, the deli sometimes closes a few minutes early on slow nights, before their posted hours. This is annoying. In my opinion reputable businesses stick to their posted hours! The prices can be high for some things but are low for others.
