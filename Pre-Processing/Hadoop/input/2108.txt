Since my last five star review, they have added a beautiful addition but have removed some of the menu items that we used to love (dad-in-law always got the tacos, admittedly an out of place menu item but they were good). The service and cooking seems much more inconsistent...either short staffed or your steak doesn't get cooked how you ordered it. Still a great place though.
Loved it!  We got rained out of Peek-n-Peak's Adventure Park and found this place on my Yelp app.  Good beer, wings and salads...kids loved it too.  Definitely would come again.
Ive been here 3-4 times in the past summer and food is EXCELLENT, at this family owned (coolest place you can't find) out in the woods.  Bar staff fun and attentive the meals are affordable and very good. Haven't made it up there this winter yet but hear they do a good bit of business for events, bands and snowmobile folks.. (they were under construction for building out a new section outside) and it looks good already..   Plenty of private parking, 3-4 buildings, smoker, and handicap parking right out front.. Go with your friends/family for a great experience.. Just saw they have a webcam on their website too  pinejunction.chautauquas…
This place was really cute. I'd give it 4.5 stars but you know. :) my husband had the burgers with the battered fried sliced jalapeños and it was good. Mine was less flavorful. I would next time get a signature burger. I'm scared away when burgers are sauced but his was not overly so. They came out cooked thru and I would have preferred my burger less cooked so ask if you want to. But the place is awesome! And in the middle of nowhere kinda! Very unique beautiful and well done. Great menu, good beers. Helpful staff. Really try it out! Were from Cleveland and were at peek n peak so we made the trip down the gravel road. Middle of nowhere and place was busy for a Monday lunch. :) that's a good sign. Thank you helpers.
Good food.  Good service. Recommended by Holiday Inn front desk. I was a little nervous about finding a place to eat as the hotel was isolated. Unlikely that I'll be back in this area again but if I ever am, I'd come back.

Stumbled across this gem on yelp about a month ago. The drive was daunting and it looked a little shady to be honest pulling up in the middle of the night. But oh my word BEST BURGER I HAVE EVER EATEN IN MY LIFE. Once you walk inside, it's a totally different atmosphere - seems like a bunch of local snowmobiling fanatics? Not sure how to describe it. But the live music was decent and it was just all around a fun, laid back place to be. I will definitely be back next time I'm skiing up that way.

We loved this place.   Grabbed lunch on a rainy Saturday afternoon; got a table in the bar area.   My wife loved her chicken salad, and I had the turkey melt which was awesome.   They had numerous craft beers on tap which were very reasonably priced.  Pumking!!  It so happened there was live music that was low-key but enjoyable. Service was quick and friendly.  And to finish off our gluttonous afternoon we had an order of funnel cake fries which were unbelievable.  You must get these for dessert.   Service was quick and friendly.   Go here!!!

What a great little find.  My partner, mom, aunt, and I came here last year while staying in Chautauqua for the week.  We liked it so much we came back this year.  It was even better this time.  We sat outside and watched 2 deer enjoying their supper also.   We also were entertained by the 2 cats that seem to live on the grounds.  Three of us got burgers that were very good.  The beer selection was nice and served ice cold.  My partner wanted the ribs that she saw listed.  They told here that was a weekend special not available on Monday.  The waitress went and checked with the kitchen and they made them for her anyway!  The ribs were really good, but what made the meal was the homemade cornbread with a cinnamon/honey/butter sauce that was divine!  This little out of the way place has become a fast favorite, well worth the drive to find it.

Whether you're a local, in town for a ski trip, or a weekend at the lake, Pine Junction is the place to be. We went in the winter, and it was exactly what we wanted on a snowy night for dinner before a day of skiing. They have a good selection of beers on tap, and they were cheap! Also the food was great, we shared delicious burgers and a killer pulled pork sandwich, and an appetizer of fried pickles. "Fried pickles??" you might be wondering, they are better than they sound. Warm and crispy, with a tasty dill dipping sauce. Its a nice, cozy, family owned and run place, where if the restaurant is busy, a friend of the restaurant will get up from their meal and start clearing tables. Love it. There aren't many good restaurants in the Findley Lake area, but this one is definitely a must-go. Kind of hard to find, just keep following the road untli you think you might have past it, and then its set back in the pines.
