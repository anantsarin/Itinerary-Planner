This is quite the bagel shop when it comes to what they put in the sandwich. Their very unique custom made selections is what makes them stand out of the rest of the other bagel shops. The pastries are pretty decent as well. The only problem I had is the pricing.

After a day/night of drinking, a hearty breakfast was in order.  Since this place was in walking distance of my buddy's house, this was an easy decision.  The reviews of this place placed my expectations high.  I'm happy to say this was a really great place, with a wide selection of bagels, sandwiches and pastries.  I decided to get their head gasket special which was egg, bacon, sausage, cheese, hashbrown on a bagel of my choice (sun dried tomato).  The bagel itself was excellent, the egg was overly-plentiful.  The hashbrown was a bit soggy and kept falling out of the humongous sandwich.  The sandwich was very, very greasy and messy.  But I guess that is what you get with all that stuff packed between a bagel.  I'd love to go back and try one of their wraps or sandwiches as they look pretty good.  The place was super busy and were lucky to find a spot inside to enjoy our meal.

Decent price for great grub. Had the Maggie's Farm and Pesto T. Twister. Can't go wrong with either. Takeout option is available at this location.

Whenever I think of bagels now, I think of Collegetown Bagels. And thinking about Collegetown Bagels makes me miss Cornell and Ithaca a LOT. This location was perfect, since it was located a stone's throw away both from the law school and the apartment I had my 1L year. It's always crowded. They have SOOO many different bagel sandwiches. My favorite is the Eggs Christina, not just because it's named after me (hah, I wish), but because the combination of bagel, egg, ham, and cheese is always delicious. I also love their tuna melt bagel and pizza bagel. Their sandwiches are good, too. I also love the fact that they serve beer and ice cream in addition to bagels, soup, sandwiches, pastries, coffee, tea, smoothies, shakes, etc. CTB, you have saved me from hunger and provided me with delicious food on many occasions, as well as given me warmth and shelter from the insane snowy freezing Ithaca weather.

I live in NYC now and I STILL miss this place, even though NYC has delicious bagels. Definitely a staple for Cornell students and must-try if visiting.

If i'm traveling, and i go to the same place twice- that isn't starbucks- that means something.  I was in Ithaca for four days and hit this place THREE TIMES.   bagel sammies.  done.  local beers.  yes.  Kombucha.  YES. btw, the cashier asked me if i had ever had Kombucha before- when i said yes, she said ok good, because people buy them and then think they've gone bad.  LOL!!   Guess Kombucha is new to Ithaca- i've been drinking it in hippie California for years... ;)

I've tried a few of the sandwiches here, but my favorites/regulars were the California Sunrise bagel and pizza bagel. I've also gotten the BLT here twice, which is also good. CTB has a very extensive selection of bagels and sandwiches, so you're bound to find something you like. They also have pre-made sandwiches/food items. Their desserts are also pretty good. They have just about anything you'd crave. CTB also serves beer and sangria.  It's nice to get one and sit outside on a warm, sunny day (it gets crowded on days like this, though) I really like the location as well, so you can pick up a morning coffee/bagel and head to class if you live in Collegetown. It's right outside the university, so even non-Collegetown people can easily come and enjoy a good bagel.

Best sandwiches in collegetown, albeit a little pricey. Decent beers and good sangria and friendly staff. Can be a bit too crowded and slow sometimes, but one of the best places in collegetown for sure.

Lunch staple for Cornell students.  Fun atmosphere, although it get so busy at lunch time that it can be a little slow then.  Most of their sandwiches are overpriced, but the ingredients are of good quality and they have a wide range of sandwiches. Favorites: --California Sunrise (although they could really work on their scrambled eggs--I think they might just microwave them) --Buttermilk Bialy (try substituting parsley-garlic dressing instead of the mustard) --Last Strand --Sweet Rachel (although I usually have to ask for them to go a little lighter on the mustard) There really is something here for almost everyone.  And the desserts are great, too.  (I'm not a coffee drinker so I can't weigh in on that.)

The Chicken Salad Melt on Sun-dried Tomato. I'm pretty sure I cried a little after my first bite of this incredible sandwich. It's basically a slice of tomato on top of melted swiss on top of a hefty dollop of creamy chicken salad on top of an aromatic slice of sun-dried tomato bagel. Think that sounds amazing? Well, get ready for more amazing, because they give you TWO of these so that you get a beautiful, fat sandwich when you squish them together in a celebration of bagelesque heaven. Oh yes. Everybody rejoice. Another thing I really enjoyed from CTB was this sort of peanut butter-apple-raspberry chipotle wrap that my best friend ordered. I took a curious bite and immediately begged to trade half of my sandwich for half of her wrap. It was really that incredible. Also, I might just be too detail-oriented, but I really appreciated how thinly-sliced the apples were. It complimented the peanut butter well but didn't overpower the subtle spiciness of the chipotle raspberry dressing. The drinks here left little to be desired, but it's a bagel shop, not a coffee shop, so whatevs. I ordered the Cayuga Cocoa (unimpressive) and tried a popular combo-fruit smoothie (average). Stick to water or bottled beverages to wash down your superb sandwiches. Cute place, bustling crowds, quick lines, creative chalkboard menu with lots of busy colors, efficient staff, and the perfect epitome of Collegetown success.

Surprise!  Your cashier has a full face-tattoo! Nonetheless, the default eat-place on College Ave.  I used to scarf pizza-bagels here at least four days a week in the days before acid-reflux, daydreaming at a window seat about the architecture student chicks who would wander in with tattered portfolios and names like Iyla and Krik-Krak.

Overwhelmed by all the crazy conference-goers in town, the staff at CTB did an excellent job churning out our orders in a timely and efficient manner.   There are a lot of options to choose from, and I had a standard Bronx bagel while seated outside, away from all the din.  If I had more time in Ithaca, I definitely would have tried some of the other combinations and the delicious sounding coffee drinks!

Delicious! Well priced, yummy bagels. Amazing sandwich selections-- the only downside is that there are SO MANY and never enough time to browse through all the offerings. Discount Tuesdays are the best- $5 dozens!
Do you have a hankering for a delicious breakfast or lunch? Then grab your appetite and go to Collegetown Bagels. All of their bagels and bread are baked fresh, and their soup options change daily. CTB offers a myriad of mouthwatering sandwich options on their huge chalkboard menu--there seriously must be over 100 combinations--from specialty sandwiches, bagel sandwiches, breakfast sandwiches, deli sandwiches...and if you don't see exactly what you're craving, they'll gladly create it for you. They also have pre-made salads (meh), pastries and desserts and ice cream, coffee, smoothies, and other beverages. It's oh-so-easy to create your own perfect meal. For breakfast, my favorite is the San Diego--your choice of bagel (I go with the Long Island, AKA Everything) with cream cheese and raspberry jalapeno jam on top. For lunch, I usually lean towards the Tuscan Verde (chicken breast with pesto, spinach, tomato, and provolone on rosemary focaccia) and the Jonah's Jive (homemade hummus, spinach, tomato, and cucumber-parsley-garlic dressing on multi-grain bread). The Tuna Melt is also a finger-lickin-good indulgence. CTB's location just off campus in Collegetown is uber convenient, as evidenced by the lunch rush every day (don't worry--the line moves quickly). If the weather is nice, be sure to snag a table out on the patio and enjoy a pitcher of beer or sangria so you can enjoy the sun while it lasts.

CTB is quintessential college town eats.  It would take you months to try every variation of sandwiches, bagels, and soups they have to offer.  They also have a great selection of pastries; their chocolate chip cannolis are amazing.   When the weather is nice, the CTB patio is the place to relax and enjoy a pitcher of beer or a carafe of sangria. My one pet peeve with this location is that it is often overly crowded during meal times.  The space inside is tight and can get quite hectic at times.   Lastly, there is often live music in the evenings which adds a nice dimension to the atmosphere.

Their menu is huge, there must be something here you would like. I have yet to try everything, but I have yet to be disappointed. The sandwiches on bagels are very delicious.

Really good sandwiches! Turkey BLT is 10 times better than it sounds and the iced coffees aren't bad either, sandwhiches can be expensive upwards of 9/10 dollars even. All in all great place.

My boyfriend (now fiancee-wow that sounds so weird~) took me here after whisking me away to Ithaca last weekend and proposing-so I guess this review might be partial but I think I also fell in love with this place over the weekend too!   We got the Spicy Italian bagel and Bialy bagel to go, a hashbrown, and 2 bagel orders: the Tex Mex on a Long Island Wheat (he's from LI), and the California Sunrise (I think that was the name of it) on a bagel I forget I got...we had to wait a while and it was peak ordering time even though the students are out for the summer, but wow did it all taste great!  Oh, we also got a Chocolate Hazelnut croissant and a Cinnamon Bun to go, which were yummy later too.  And coffee!   A cute, homey, electic place and also serves alcohol and names some of their coffee drinks after 90s tv/toys/culture (which made me feel really old-the 90s weren't that long ago lol).  College Town Bagels really embodies and anchors what any college town should have to ensure a strong collegiate school spirit!

Ahhh. Yeah. I remember those days ...when a bagel HAD to be a meal. These bagels were good to me. They kept me goin' and I understood why NY water makes the best bagels!

I got the Patrick Ewing (turkey, brie, apple and mustard sandwich.) Honestly, it was pretty good. I wish there was more turkey and more apple, (aka - less mustard and less brie.) I never say there should be less cheese, but there should have been less cheese. The line was pretty weird, people here are all over the map. Little kids were jogging around. It was not my favorite. When I got to the end, the cashier was like, you need to claim your sandwich! Someone could have just taken this! My thought was, and then you would have had to have gotten me another one... Just a little weird that it was my responsibility. Overall, pretty good.

It looks really delightful but a cup of chicken soup without any chicken in it and a purported pepperoni bagel pizza without any pepperoni on it did put a bit of a damper on the experience.

Hard to argue with success.  You can see up to 400 students in there most days in line from about 7AM to 10AM,   I remember when it was just a hole in the wall 30 years ago and the only thing they sold was bagels. I've baked bagels professionally-- they don't seem to boil them long enough and they are often under-baked.  I give them a try about once a year and haven't been impressed.   I think the one at P&C is a bit better and it's not the zoo like the one in C-Town.

Terrible smoothie -- perhaps because I chose a 'make-your-own' with banana + mango + yogurt... but it was like drinking expensive pure sugar...

I went here late one night after lots of drinking at a wedding and their Turkey Hill BLT was just what I was looking for.  The sandwich is massive and delicious! There was also a dude sitting in the restaurant offering up free beer from his pitcher... haha, how can you beat that?
I'll admit it--I'm a CTB junkie.  I've been out of the area for just over a month and I'm still feeling the withdrawl symptoms. For those new to the place, the extensive chalkboard menu can seem overwhelming at first, but there are many hidden treasures that await you there.  A few tips and tricks to help you out... If you're overwhelmed by the menu and just can't decide what to get my advice would be to pick one ingredient you like--say, turkey--and scan the menu for anything containing that item that strikes your fancy. Their coffee products tend to be very strong, so if you're a coffee novice like me, order carefully. Every month they feature a few special bagels and cream cheese flavors, which are usually delicious--spinach and feta bagels are a favorite!

Oh, man, do I dig this local chain. I can (and I do, whenever I'm in the area) eat here everyday and not get sick of it. Get one of their gazillion Bialy(ie?)s. Cheap, tasty eats in "Gorges" Ithaca!

This place is expensive. Most of their small sandwiches are $7-$9, but the quality is decent. I like to go with their basic deli sandwiches with all the free veggies. Their egg salad sandwich at $3.75 plus tax and tip is probably the best deal on the menu. I really like their outdoor seating area for chatting with friends over a pitcher of beer in the summer.
The bottom line: If I lived in Ithaca I would come back. It could be that this place caters to students, but the dazzling amount of choices and the great quality of the sandwiches and drinks we had made us fans. The pro's: The two main things that stand out are the variety and the quality of the food. I also liked the seating options The con's: Just a bit on the expensive side for this product

Yes, yes, yes.  If you want it, CTB has it.  During a week-long stay in Ithaca I came here many times, sometimes more than twice in one day.  From early morning bagel sandwiches and coffee to late-night drinks, this is where it's at in the Collegetown area.

Hands down the best bagels. There are so many different kinds of bagels, freshly made. Several cream cheese spreads to try (pumpkin!) or you can make it into a delicious sandwich. Every time I visit my sister at Cornell, I need to have a bagel... and take a dozen or so home with me.

Amazing coffee and great sandwiches - it's also an ice cream shop with killer milkshakes.  A perfect spot in this pretty little college town in the Finger Lakes.

So the previous 20+ people have said all that there is to say about CTB...the rundown goes as follows: -Essential part of the Collegetown scene -Big-city expensive, small town location -Yes, they serve beer (see above) -People watching is fun -Bagels are fresh, and very good -Sandwiches are tasty -Baked goods case = awesome -Good study spot The one fact that has been left out is that CTB has the ONLY publicly accessible restroom in Collegetown. This is essential knowledge. You laugh, but sometimes, you know, back in those old under 21 days, you get out of a party in CTown, and you have to make it back to west or north or your fraternity/sorority house, and you're hungry...are you really gonna wait in the mob at Mama T's for a half hour with a raging full bladder? I'm just sayin....and even if you aren't buying, you can always slip in the back door and fast track it, they're nice about that. They aren't just a great restaurant, they provide a valuable community service as well...

I no longer have a taste for bagels NOT made by CTB/Ithaca Bakery.  Great sandwiches too.  There's a reason it's crowded people - it's great!!  Staff is always friendly and professional.

Two words: Dewitt Melt. Get a Dewitt Melt and one of those crazy coffee drinks with four shots of espresso. Then go to Uris and study all night. To be honest, CTB never really impressed me too much -- especially the coffee -- but it's open late and some of their sandwiches are pretty damn good.

The ingredients here are great, but the staff here are poorly trained and the place is a hectic mess. So, get a bagel or coffee to go, but don't bother with a sandwich or anything else prepared. Breakfast sandwiches are too greasy, and sandwiches are a wild card--they run out of ingredients all the time, and the sandwiches are not remotely the same way twice, and always messed up. I've been here many times, and have finally vowed to stop getting any of their meals. Their sandwiches are sloppy and poorly made, and what's worse, they take forever. In general, that's the biggest problem with this place. The customer service is horrible, and you can waste twenty minutes of your life waiting to buy one plain bagel or a scoop of ice cream. The lines are poorly managed, and you have to wait forever for no reason.

CTB ... one of my favorite Cornell pastimes. Oh how I miss thee, especially on breezy sunny days where I long to drink my sorrows away with several carafes of sangria in the company of my friends. Food is awesome; I just wish the prices were too. They have a huge selection of sandwiches, baked goods/desserts, snacks, and drinks. It is always busy, so allot extra time for ordering, paying, and actually receiving your food if you're on an agenda. On days when it is sunny and relatively warm (a rarity in Ithaca), expect the patio to be packed, so you have to act fast if you want to get a table. Some recommendations on goodies: - Flyin' Ryan (turkey, avocado, coleslaw, & aioli on foccacia): this was a daily special, so be sure to check what's the special when you order. If you can order this again, I totally recommend it; it was the perfect combination. - Big Apple (roast turkey breast, homemade plum chutney, spinach, & cheddar cheese on multi-grain bread): the chutney added a nice touch of sweetness to what would otherwise be a pretty healthy option. - Lindsey (roast turkey, mushrooms, parsley-garlic dressing, & melted muenster on a bialy): I normally substitute the parsley-garlic dressing with aioli, and it is dripping with flavor. - Stewart Parker (roast turkey and melted swiss on a croissant): the croissant is perfectly flaky. It has an upscale feel but a comfort food taste. - Bronx Bagel (scrambled eggs with sausage) on a sundried tomato bagel: the sundried tomato bagel is a MUST. - any of the goodies in the glass display case by the cashier The sangria isn't anything special. In fact, they actually pour it from a bottle (it's not made in-house) and just add some slices of oranges -- and voila -- that's their sangria. When you go to drink sangria on a nice day, you're not really going because the sangria tastes good but more because it's fun to enjoy the weather and hang out with friends. The staff is friendly and look like typical Ithaca hippies. The walls with the menus are colorfully drawn. It has prime real estate and is a convenient stop on the way to class or right before you catch the Shortline to the city ... or if you just like to people watch. It is open early for breakfast and closes pretty late for a late-night bite or some drinks. CTB is an essential stop if you're visiting Ithaca. Delicious food indeed.

I never understood the appeal of this place.  Yes, it was great to people-watch, but I never got past paying a lot of money for mediocre bagels.  Call me an NYC bagel snob.
CTB is probably a staple of most Cornell students. They whip up great sandwiches, bagels, desserts, drinks, soups, and more. See their menu above! I get the CTBLT a lot, but others are great as well. Great place to just eat lunch and work out your homework or people watch on College Ave. Yelper bathroom alert: Unless things have radically changed since I was last there, avoid the restrooms! There isn't even paper towels, but instead a cloth towel where everyone can use (how wonderful...if you want to be friends with everyone else germs!)
Great bagels! I just wish they bought some good Italian espresso machines. Their coffee is awful

Great food for, reasonably priced, awesome and convenient place to hang out and grab a drink.  Some awesome bagels are California Sunrise and Autumn Sky

There are so, so, SO many options here. It's mind-boggling. And they have more than just bagels! They have sandwiches and desserts and more...yummmm. I'm pretty sure that anyone can find something that they like here! The only problem is that service can be kind of slow at times, especially  when there's a lot of people. Another thing -- this place is definitely more than $ on yelp...it might be less than $11 per bagel for some of them, but people usually don't eat just one bagel for a meal.

So sad to have graduated and not have rosemary salt bagels in my life anymore.

If ever there were a place that epitomised the crunchy granola goodness of Ithaca, NY, CTB would be it. I loved that I could come here for breakfast, lunch, dinner, coffee, anytime between 6am and 3am. Some of my best memories include sangria afternoons on the patio, tofu scramble breakfasts, Viva Chelsea sandwiches for lunch, hot chocolate with a shot of chocolate-mint Monin syrup, or one of their many delicious pastries for when I just needed that sugar rush. You can't go wrong with any of their choices!

BEST BAGEL BREAKFAST SANDWICH EVER!  I had heard rumors that this place was good but I never knew it would be THAT good.  So good that during my conference at Cornell I went every day for breakfast.  Thanks CTB!
So sad to have graduated and not have rosemary salt bagels in my life anymore.
I'd say one of the better places to grab a bite if you have to stop at a "coffee shop."  The menu covers a full wall and the variety might cause you some decision paralysis. Each sandwich I've tried is pretty darn good...  You might never find one like it elsewhere... the desserts come from Ithaca Bakery and are delicious... makes me want to like my chops just thinking about it all.

Totally by coincidence, I was offered an opportunity to travel to Ithaca for work (yes, really) ahead of a separately and coincidentally planned weekend trip to the Finger Lakes region.  Having gone to college at Cornell, walking around campus brought back a flood of wonderful memories, many of which involved either breakfast, lunch, dinner, or a late-night snack at one of Collegetown's most recognizable establishments -- Collegetown Bagels. Seven years later, though some of the menu items have changed, I was pleased to find that CTB is the same as I remembered it.  It boasts a colorful menu of delicious bagel sandwiches for any time of the day -- I'd recommend the Big Sur, Brooklyn, or Bronx sandwiches for breakfast, the Taughannock, Tuscan Verde, tuna melt, or roast beef for lunch and/or dinner, and the pizza bagels for late night grub.  It's really hard to go wrong.  Add in the outdoor seating and beer, and you've got Cornell's truest hotspot!
Please this is not a good bakery. I have a terrible sweet tooth and cannot say no to dessert. But I went there and got a pastry that i just threw away after a few bites. It was butter and sugar and still not tasty. This place is overpriced and unoriginal. Spend your money elsewhere. You can buy a little debbie zebra cake that tastes much better than $3 desserts they sell here.
This place will always feel like home and make me feel like I'm 20 again. They might not have THE best coffee in Ithaca, but their selection of bagels and sandwiches more than make up for that. Plus the awesome people-watching opportunities as well as outdoor seating in the summer. I always get the vegetarian bagel when I'm here. This last trip, it got me powered up for 14 miles of gorge hiking. Thanks, CTB!
I think every Cornell graduate has some nostalgic feelings of CTB, including myself, so perhaps I'm a little biased. The bagels, sandwiches, and coffee drinks are truly quality.  But they are overpriced for the amount of food you get (the average price for a sandwich is around 7 bucks but they are kind of small).  My favorite thing there was the vegetarian bagel (and I usually hate vegetarian anything): bagel of your choice (my fave was the garlic), layer of vegetable cream cheese (with small chucks of carrots and onions and some other stuff), slices of tomatoes, then covered in Muenster cheese and baked.   There is the one specialty ice coffee drink that I don't remember the name anymore that has milk and vanilla and 4 shots of espresso.  Got me through many all nighters.
The staff is very good and the selection of food and drinks can't be beat. I don't really know how this place manages to offer such a wide selection of things, plus maintain the hours they do... the complexity must be mind-boggling but they must rake in a lot of dough! Pretty much everything I've tried has been great. The selection can be overwhelming... if you're not familiar with the menu, I recommend looking online before you go or standing outside looking at it through the windows so you can be ready to order when you get in line. There are a couple of drawbacks to this location of CTB: First, they don't do a great job keeping the outside clean especially when there are a lot of students around. They need to be a little more attentive to changing the outside trash bins, cleaning up messes, etc. Also, the CO2 system on their beer taps is really messed up, or at least it was the last 2 times we went. The beer is almost flat, and the guys serving don't seem to know what to do to fix it.

As Yelpers point out, THE place for coffee in Ithaca, especially in the morning.  They also make excellent breakfast items (not just bagels) and will work with dietary restrictions well.  Unfortunately Cornell's campus doesn't have much in the way of good coffee, but thankfully Collegetown Bagels comes to the rescue!
This little bagle shop is so convienient located in college town and at east hill plaza in Ithaca, NY. The sandwiches are very good, they also serve coffee, and a wide veriety of other things. Service there is great everyone is friendly. I would recomend eating there if looking for something quick and good for lunch.

While the sandwiches are tasty, the internal organization is such that you could spend hours on line. They are not well-equipped for the tremendous crowd that swarms this store during the lunch hour. They would really benefit from a look at a Midtown Manhattan lunch spot. The store could also be a lot cleaner.
Collegetown Bagel's or "CTB" is a solid choice for breakfast or lunch in Ithaca. They have a great menu with bagels, pastries, sandwiches, coffee, and even ice cream. Their bagels are great even when compared to NYC, NJ, or Long Island. The coffee is good as well. My only gripe with this restaurant is the prices. Probably the most expensive bagel joint I've ever been to. My go to breakfast is a long island wheat bagel with veggie cream cheese and a medium coffee.
Delicious whitefish salad! I came for a visit multiple times and each time the whitefish salad was perfection. The bagels themselves ranged from a bit too tough to just right. I got it openfaced with tomato on top and it was a delicious filling meal. When in Ithaca, Collegetown bagels is the place to be!

I've never been a big fan of this place.  Maybe it's because of the fact that I'm hanging out and drinking with my friends on a Friday night at a bagel store?  I don't know if it's just me but I find that extremely bizarre.  Other than that, I really don't like the bagels there because I always get a breakfast type sandwich and I'm kind of gross out by the fact that they take eggs from a bottle and microwaves it.  I gave their other sandwiches a try as well and I find that I don't enjoy them very much, but maybe it's a matter of taste.  However, I do like the atmosphere there, and if you're in town, you should give this place a try.
Collegetown Bagels has long been a Cornell staple. I've heard many Cornell alum friends rave about this place and so my partner and I tried it for ourselves during a day trip while visiting home. I ordered the Bay Burger and she ordered the Reuben. We were each impressed by the Bay Burger's taste, quality, and ingredients. It was delicious, especially for a vegetarian burger! The reuben however, was a little underwhelming; it tasted good enough, but the corned beef slices used had a texture akin to that of bologna. Portion sizes also seemed small, given the price we paid.

The bagels are pretty good, I'll give them that. But... 1. The microwaved eggs are disgusting 2. the cheese is always unmelted 3. the "we think you are going to steal everyone's sandwhich" service is not the friendliest attitude to have. However, they are a tradition!
This place has a menu item for EVERYONE. I personally like it because they serve breakfast options all day and have vegetarian/vegan options. They make their own hummus as well! The bagels are great too, of course. Besides their extensive menu of wraps, sandwiches, and drinks, Collegetown Bagels serves baked goods, premade meals, and healthy snacks. Definitely not a place to be missed!

They have nearly any bagel sandwich combo you can think of. Very close and convenient to the law school, as well. They also have a pretty cool array of desserts. I am not crazy about the coffee, but there it's better than the alternative starbucks down the street.
A must stop for anyone in the Cornell area. Every time I visited one of my siblings who went to Cornell, this was always on the top of the list for eateries to visit. Living in Florida, it has been tough getting a " New York" style bagel. Boy, did this place satisfy my craving! Both the breakfast and lunch selections offered plenty for everyone and the coffee was delicious ( Florida still hasn't figured out a winning coffee formula yet.) I had always thought this was just a breakfast place but after a couple of pitchers in the afternoon, I knew otherwise. It offers the best outdoor seats of any place on campus, and is a great hangout on those extremely rare sunny days in Ithaca. The only potential problem I saw was their pickup system for drinks and food. If you're trying to get food to go, you have to wait with your order slip instead of being given a number. On a busy day, if someone ordered the same thing. ( Which happened quite a bit when I was there ) you could be potentially waiting a long time if someone takes your order by mistake. Having said that, I love this place and will always visit when I'm in the area.

Way overpriced for what they give you. I'm really disappointed that they're such an institution in town because the service is always cold, the portions insignificant, and the sandwiches are whatever. Skip their baked goods, bagels, and breakfast options. The breakfast burrito is a rip off, their pastries bland, and HORRIBLE things that do not deserve to be called bagels. Even Wegman's has better bagels. The rest of the breads and sandwiches are OK and I will say that the Zoey with cheddar on rosemary foccacia is bliss.
Generally always crowded and disorganized. Bagels take forever to be made and are small and only slightly better than mediocre. The coffee is alright, but there are many interesting super-caffeinated drinks that I didn't actually get to try. Definitely NOT the best bagels in New York like some reviewers claim... I mean come on, I've had better bagels in the suburbs of New Jersey...

Love their bagels! Perfect place for Cornellians' gathering! We should consider it part of Cornell community.
Good coffee and the desserts look fresh.  The open concept makes for a noisy place.  Lots of glass creates a nice view while sipping on your coffee. Seating is a bit tight.  Friendly staff.  I like how they have the free newspapers sitting there when you walk in.

i'm not local enough to address this place by calling it "CTB" but i do feel that with only a couple visits we are very much on a first name basis! and how could you not be?? this place is so welcoming and comfortable and convenient and wonderful i didnt want to leave! they have flavored coffee brewing: vanilla and hazelnut there is a projector for sports games near the back wall there is an awesome outdoor seating area and you can get a pretty good connection to the Red Rover wireless internet from Cornell. there is a "guest" option so essentially internet is free here sometimes they put out free samples of cookie bites cornell performing arts and law school is just across the street i've heard you can get ice cream here too. but i didn't know when i was there. also, when they're making a hot sandwich the whole place smells like the most wonderful ham and cheese delight you could ever imagine. you'll want to have one for yourself.
Solid breakfast, great bagels and delicious coffee. Lovely service and great atmosphere. Will come again if I'm ever in town.

Fun place to grab a quick meal and a drink- whether it be a coffee or beer. We got the Bay Burger and a Reuben. Bay Burger was delicious, but the corned beef in the Reuben is definitely not house made and definitely came from a package. Coffee was good, but nothing special. I can see why college kids frequent this place.
Chai latte is better than Starbucks

Located conveniently in the heart of Collegetown, CTB is a Cornell and Ithaca classic. Whenever we are in town we try to get it. Going to this location lets us reminisce about the wonderful flavors of college. The bagels here are good, they make great sandwiches, and their desserts are also delicious. My fav sandwich is the CTBLT, which I like on plain, sesame, or rosemary salt. They also have a huge selection of specialty coffees, drinks and yummy sangria, wine & beer. Definitely recommend the sangria outside on a spring/summer afternoon. Nice and relaxing! Only thing I wish is that they would update the furniture situation. Still pretty uncomfortable and crazy crowded outside (like literally climbing over people to get to your table).
Really delicious, really fresh and soft bagels. Tried spicy italian and rosemary salt; they were so good. We made our own sandwiches, but their options looked great too.

The sandwiches and bagels are good, but it is hard to find seating and it is kinda expensive. The menu is written on a chalk board and there are so many options that you can fet overwhelmed. Really good coffee!!!
Overpriced and just not very good.  I have never been able to figure out people's fascination with this place.  It's essentially a "fake" deli.  Maybe the people that love it have never been to an actual deli in the NYC/Long Island area where you get double the food and better quality for half the price.
Chai latte is better than Starbucks
Solid breakfast, great bagels and delicious coffee. Lovely service and great atmosphere. Will come again if I'm ever in town.
Yeah, maybe not the cheapest place in college town (try Thai House for $1.50 lunch), but it is a great place to sit outside and eat, drink, listen to great live music, and watch some people. CTB regularly has live bands in the evenings, especially throughout the summer. I miss this place every time we have a sunny day out here in California and I realize there's no place to sit outside and listen to music.

I think if I lived in Ithaca, this would be an institution but the bagels really aren't that great. Maybe I'm biased since I live in Brooklyn but the bagels were not as good as they are cracked up to be. I did, however, love the bagel sandwich I had with avocado, greens, mustard, and cheese. Very tasty, overall. I also liked the service. Seemed pretty efficient for employing almost entirely high schoolers and Cornell students.
This place is really cool! They have an eccentric bagel menu and there's lots to choose from! Definitely a place to eat at if you are visiting Cornell you see lots of students eating here. Great for breakfast or lunch or both!

Coming into town around Commencement weekend, we tried out this place since we would need to wait 2 hours for a seat in Carriage House. The bagels were awesome if not overpriced. The coffee was meh. I could make a better coffee at home. I'd give the bagels a 4 star but the coffee and the long crowded line made this place end up with a 3 star rating.
I used to work here, when I was a college student ten million years ago. I loved watching those bagels bobbing around in the hot water; before getting baked in the huge oven. These were reaaaaaal bagels.
Overpriced and just not very good.  I have never been able to figure out people's fascination with this place.  It's essentially a "fake" deli.  Maybe the people that love it have never been to an actual deli in the NYC/Long Island area where you get double the food and better quality for half the price.
Yeah, maybe not the cheapest place in college town (try Thai House for $1.50 lunch), but it is a great place to sit outside and eat, drink, listen to great live music, and watch some people. CTB regularly has live bands in the evenings, especially throughout the summer. I miss this place every time we have a sunny day out here in California and I realize there's no place to sit outside and listen to music.
Absolutely the best! My wife and I had our first date here about 8 years ago.  We even got engaged out front!  The Brooklyn with cheese has to be the best bagel combo.  Not to mention the awesome desserts.  There is no wrong answer.   Do yourself a favor and get a M&M cookie.  SO good.   First stop every time we are in town.
After you get over the fact that the food is quite expensive for what it is and the portions are skimpy, you realize that the options and quality are really great.  Dozens of rotating bagel varieties, sandwiches, soups, and desserts.  It is certainly not your run of the mill bagel/sandwich shop.  Bread bowl soups are probably the best deal, which I enjoyed many times as an undergrad.
I think if I lived in Ithaca, this would be an institution but the bagels really aren't that great. Maybe I'm biased since I live in Brooklyn but the bagels were not as good as they are cracked up to be. I did, however, love the bagel sandwich I had with avocado, greens, mustard, and cheese. Very tasty, overall. I also liked the service. Seemed pretty efficient for employing almost entirely high schoolers and Cornell students.
This place is really cool! They have an eccentric bagel menu and there's lots to choose from! Definitely a place to eat at if you are visiting Cornell you see lots of students eating here. Great for breakfast or lunch or both!

The bagels are decent and I really enjoyed the sandwiches.  The sandwich menu is very extensive.  It took me about 10 minutes to decide.  Also the mocha latte is excellent!  Much better than Starbucks.  I can't wait to go back!
Do you like bagels? YES. Do you like alcohol? YES. Do you wanna be cool? YES. CTB is the place to be. They have an amazing selection of bagels with all sorts of toppings imaginable. My personal favorites are the Pizza Bagel- its great to have a nice, toasty warm bagel on a cold winter night. I also love the vegetarian bagel - cheese and tomatoes on a nice hot bagel. You can choose what kind of bagel you want, I like the everything bagel so I don't have to choose what kind of topping I want on my bagel. The sangria here is to die for. Get a whole pitcher and split it with your friends (or don't split it... that's fine too!) Come here for green beer on St Patty's Day. This place is open late at night too. If you need a little pick me up on those late nights of studying, come over here!

CTB, I love you.  If you moved up to Boston, you could be my BFF.
Mostly delicious food (I'd avoid chicken sandwiches, have had some dry ones, seems to be their Achilles' heel), kitschy, fun environment, beers, real good location, this place kicks ass.  Wish we had a place like this around where I live.

CTB is a Cornell staple, you can't visit Ithaca without coming here for a sandwich-- They have every kind to choose from and the collegetown staff is awesome.
Thanks bae. I got the "Pinot Nawara" panini and it was SO GOOD!!!!!!!! The only annoying thing here is every time I get a pastry I have to wait 5 minutes even though it's sitting right there... but the food and drinks are great!

Collegetown Bagels offers a range of coffee drinks, beer and sangria, sandwiches and confections. The space has both indoor and outdoor seating with picnic tables and umbrellas. There is a veritably large list of sandwiches on both specialty rolls and bagels, with wiggle room for substitution, including vegan substitutions for almost ever item. CTB's prices range between reasonable and high, but they offer easy and delicious food and drink for anyone looking for a casual meal near Collegetown in Ithaca.
I had the opportunity to have breakfast three times during my stay in Ithaca. I went to this place for two of those meals. I would say that means they are doing something right. Collegetown Bagels was a block away from our hotel. When I first walked in and saw the line... my immediate thought was to go somewhere else. I'm glad I stayed. The line moves quickly and the wait for my food after I ordered was minimal. The menu is kind of overwhelmingly... and I am completely okay with that. A massive selection of bagels, sandwiches, wraps, soups, sweets... a little bit of everything. The beverage spread is just as extensive. I would like to meet the person who walks into this place and can not find something they like. I ordered the Pizza Bagel on day one and the Mexican Bagel day two. Both were delicious. I mean, how can you go wrong with jalapeno cream cheese?! The dining space is kind of small, but even with our large group we found spots and didn't have to wait. The turnover is quick.. it's a high volume breakfast joint. The staff and service seems like a well-oiled machine. If I am ever back in the Ithaca area, I will definitely be hitting this place again.
CTB, I love you.  If you moved up to Boston, you could be my BFF.
Ah, CTB. An institution not quite as old as Big Red, but it makes up for it in cheap beer and not quite as cheap (but definitely not expensive) bagels. Beer and bagels, you ask? Absolutely. Living in Philly, it's hard to appreciate the type of place that could be made better with beer that isn't already a bar. Places like the library, or the playground, or the funeral of some guy you don't know. In Ithaca, you can go to a bagel shop at 12 noon and get blitzed before returning to the big dance competition you're there to watch. CTB is so good that I always find myself coming back even 6 years after graduating. There's just nothing not to like about the place. Drunk food, and carousing at all hours. Just this past weekend, me and about 30 people rolled up into this joint to unwind on a Saturday night (after said dance competition) and drank/ate ourselves into a stupor. This place is as close as it gets to a beer hall in Ithaca. Grab a pitcher, grab a few friends, tell them to get a few pitchers for themselves because there won't be enough to go around, and then drink like you go to Cornell. Now if only last call in Ithaca wasn't 1 AM. Yes, this place is fun enough that I actually want to be there until close.
Being from Montreal I'd like to think I know a thing or two about bagels. And CTB has some pretty damn good bagels. I also love going down there for some breakfast wraps. They also have a nice terrace right in college town, very nice!

Have all of the bagels you could possibly want, with some amazing coffee drinks to go along with them.  Be sure to go regularly to see the constantly changing artwork in the Downtown Ithaca location. Best all-around drink is the K-Love!
The giant menu board was intimidating for a rookie like me.  But oh, it was worth fighting through the adversity to get my denver omelette bagel thingy.

I've only been in Ithaca for a few weeks now but I've been here so many times. Such a convenient location and a great local spot for coffee or hanging out. My first experience here was before the semester began and a friend from undergrad happened to be in town so we came here and got a pitcher of beer and sat outside on a nice late summer day. For the happy hour price, it's a good amount of beer to share between two people. Lots of other people were out there enjoying beer or sangria; it's a fun spot to be in. After that, I've been coming here almost every morning to get coffee for my 8am classes.  When I get hungry between classes, it's so convenient to just run out of Hollister Hall and pick something up. The list of food items they have is insane - so many options for what you can get. My favorites are the California Sunrise and the Big Sur bagels, and on occasion I sometimes just go for a simple Nutella spread. It's pretty much the one place in Collegetown that will never disappoint.
A great little spot that I always try to stop by when I'm in town.  Excellent sandwiches, coffee drinks and sweet-flaky-pastry-type-things.  During the lunch rush it's a textbook example of organized chaos.  The line may be long, but it moves.  Counter staff are super friendly and helpful and seem to actually enjoy working there.  While I haven't had the chance to take advantage of it, the outdoor seating looks killer.

Fantastic.  College Ave location is best of the best.  Should be one in every city.  Damn it I wish I was still in college. (chicken melt).

They have a pretty decent system of keeping the line moving as it gets really crowded. I ordered a bagel with cream cheese and jelly and it was great. prices aren't too bad and this place had overall great customer service.
Try to pick a sandwich to order when you arrive in under 5 minutes I dare you! There are so many choices to go with and every single one is as amazing as the next. The biali is my bread of choice of course of course. I like the bagels but the sourdough was lacking in my opinion. They always put a good amount of meat and cheese and veggies if your ordering them on your sandwich and never fail to satisfies my lunch cravings but the reason for the 4 stars and not 5 is the price. These sandwiches are so freaking pricey it's kind of ridiculous. I understand this is aiming to get money but for the size sandwich you get it's definitely something I think may or may not be worth the price. On one hand the sandwich flavor is great and there's a lot of meant but really when I get down to paying for it I question whether or not it's worth it. Overall I keep going back but less and less and I continue to go less as the prices start to deter me more and more. But if you got money to blow and want a good sandwich then this is the place for you.

The best thing about this place is that they have a large variety of bagels and cream cheeses. The price Is not bad and they get the food out quickly.
I love CTB! It has the most unique bagel options that you will be surprised that no one  else has thought of! When the weather is good, it is very nice to eat on the CTB patio with friends and ordering some of CTB's sangria! A definite must visit for anyone visiting Ithaca.

Good bagels, not good coffee.
Consistent & reliably good bagels, sandwiches, and coffee. CTB is perfect for a quick brunch date and happy hour drinks outside when the weather's nice. Nothing like sangrias outside. The menu is a little overwhelming when you first see it because there are so many options but everything I've had has been pretty good. My go to was the one with avocado, scrambled egg, onion and cheese (forget what it was called). I also liked Jonah's Jive, which comes with tons of hummus and spinach. It can be hard to find a table sometimes because it does get crowded but customer turnover is pretty quick so you won't have to wait long before being able to grab one. Central location in Collegetown, glad that it's there!

It's okay.
Just had my first experience here for lunch and I am thoroughly impressed! I was a bit overwhelmed when looking at the board and really didn't get a chance to read over everything. I ordered the Lindsey and was happy with my decision. It was flavorful and hit the spot. The pastries also looked amazing and their happy hour deals (compared to those in San Francisco) were great!!

Somewhat overpriced but overall a variety of items to choose from. The food is good!
If Ben and Jerry ran a bagel shop, it would probably look something like this.   Good bagels and bagel sandwiches, lots of creative (and creatively-named) lunch sandwich options, and a crunchy, environmentally-friendly vibe make this place a perfect fit for a collegetown like Ithaca.   The ingredients they use are all high-quality:  if you choose to add cheese to your egg & bagel sandwich, you don't get the generic slice of American that some other places might provide - you get an aged cheddar bursting with flavor.   In addition to all the usual suspects (sesame, poppy, etc.), they've got some uncommon bagel offerings like rosemary that pair well with the sandwich fillings. It's been awhile since I lived in Ithaca, but every time I'm back in town I make a point of coming here, and I guess that says all that needs to be said.

Apparently they sold me a baby lemon cheesecake that has been previously dropped to the floor! Dust on the surface!
A bit expensive, and lack of free wi-fi is the only thing keeping this exceptional shop from getting a perfect score. Wonderful staff and great food.

To be honest, this place was so central a part of my fantastic experience as a grad student at Cornell that I'm not sure I can objectively review CTB for just being CTB.   That caveat out of the way, this place rocks!  I fondly remember those gorgeous spring days, sitting out in the patio area on College Ave, ordering pitcher after pitcher of sangria (great sangria) and soaking in the warm, welcoming sunlight.  Or those bitterly cold Ithaca nights, blowing snow, walking home from school and seeing the lights of CTB - an oasis in winter serving up great hot chocolate and coffee.   Yep, from the depths of winter to the sunshine of spring, and many excellent sandwiches (Maggies Farm is a personal favorite) in between, CTB is definitely one of Ithaca's treasures.  May it live...forever...
If I was a Cornell student, teacher, or just an Ithaca resident, I'm sure I'd be in a tumultuous love-hate relationship with Collegetown Bagels. It's right next to the south side of campus, which is right next to the law school, and has not only a fab selection of bagels and sandwiches, but an almost mind boggling selection of bagel sandwiches! I'm a sucker for hot breakfast bagel sandwiches and they have so many options and combinations of things you can get on your bagel, I would have to try each at least once. But then I could see how you could burn out on bagels, sandwiches and bagel sandwiches after coming here so much due to its enticing menu, availability of coffee drinks and convenient location and come to wish it could be another kinda of breakfast/coffee/lunch location for just a day - just for some variety. However, since I only had to chance to visit it once, I'm a fan and wish I could transplant it to SF for my own selfish reasons.

you are responsible for my awful coffee addiction and 8% of my CU graduate student loans (which is now indirectly owed to the chinese) why must you hire such a smoking hot tattooed black haired girl? you take advantage of my weakness
Lovingly known as CTB to locals, collegetown bagels is a place i surely miss since leaving Cornell. I'm not even that crazy of a bagel person but this place is awesome. You can get nearly any sandwich imaginable on a bagel and there are a few unique combinations i havent seen anywhere. In addition to all those bagel combinations they also offer a lot of ny deli sandwiches which are all extremely delicious. A few of my favorites are the mexican bagel which is a bagel with salsa lots of cream cheese, then heated in the oven with cheese on top so it comes out sorta like a pizza its delicious. The pancho villa is pretty good as well (chicken breast, avocado, salsa, jalapeno). They also make very good deli sandwiches. This place rocks!
The closest food to Cornell campus.  Almost everything here is alright, but I feel the place is generally overrated or overpriced.  I think most people come for ivy-league pre-law sandwich lounge vibe. That said it's somewhat of an institution and is definitely worth checking out and sitting down at.

I was in Ithaca for a weeding and hit up Collegetown bagels on a friend's recommendation. I went twice and had the same thing - sesame bagel with nova lox and cream cheese. The quality of the bagel and the salmon are great. The staff was, for the most part, really friendly and helpful with the giant wall menu. It's definitely crowded inside and busy so I took mine to go both days. If ever I'm in Ithaca again, I'll definitely be back.
My kinda place. Delicious, fast and has so many varieties. I had a hard time finding good places to eat at outside the Hilton garden inn but this frankly made my day. I had opa pizza bagel for lunch and it was delicious. More people need to post on yelp about restaurants around here. It helps people who are not from the area.
Visiting Ithaca for two weeks and, of course, Collegetown Bagels was the top recommendation of the locals.  I have to say, the food is good, no doubt about it - but the system is completely frustrating.  There is no good signage as to what you should do if you have the audacity to want both a bagel sandwich *and* coffee.  And this was not just me - I actually bonded with another newcomer who was equally befuddled by the insanity.  In the end, we both stood in a total of three lines to accomplish our feat.  Good sandwich, yes.  Need some work on signage, yes please.
Apparently they sold me a baby lemon cheesecake that has been previously dropped to the floor! Dust on the surface!
I will start by saying that my actual meal doesn't necessarily merit five stars.  I had the "Veganic" wrap- tofu scramble, avocado, scallions, and mushrooms (I had mine without mushrooms).  It was extraordinarily messy and drippy and was just sort of forgettable in terms of flavor.  It wasn't bad, it was just decent.  However, this place is really cute and they have a crazy extensive menu and everything sounded pretty amazing and they had a ton of vegan options.  Bagels, wraps, sandwiches, tons of topping choices, baked goods, coffee drinks, juices.  Whatever breakfastly treats you could wish for (besides waffles, but leave that to Waffle Frolic :D).  I definitely recommend it despite my mediocre sammich.
Collegetown Bagels (CTB) is hands down the most popular eatery in Collegetown if not Ithaca itself. If you're passing through it's great for a quick bite or if you're meeting with friends, a convenient spot for brunch/drinks. Breakfast bagels served all day! The Grub -- * Pumpkin Apple Bisque in a Bread Bowl ($5.50) * California Sunrise Bagel (Scrambled eggs with avocado, red onion & melted Pepper Jack cheese, on a plain bagel) ($4.75) Food Review -- I was looking forward to the Pumpkin Apple Bisque because I'm a sucker for seasonal specials. However, I watched as the waiter went outside first to try to find my table (they deliver your food to you) and it came to my table just lukewarm after being exposed to the frigid temperatures outside. Fortunately, the flavors were still intact and the chunks of apple made for a nice thick soup. The California Sunrise Bagel was alright, but the guacamole-like paste resembled a cheap store bought substitute and was not the "avocado" I was expecting. Service Review -- As a Collegetown favorite, CTB is used to a high volume of traffic especially in rushes as students try to grab a bite or a drink before class. That said, they are highly efficient and have a great flow, especially because of their streamlined method of ordering at one end of the restaurant, going through the cash register, and then picking up your order at the other end. The cashiers were cheerful Venue Review -- As mentioned earlier, the flow of traffic is great, which is a necessity because it is often packed with students. The layout is long and narrow, which makes it difficult to squeeze by other people in line if you're trying to get to the refrigerated items in the middle of the store. CTB is very cozy with both indoor and outdoor seating. It's a great spot to grab a quick bite or to sit on the barstools by the window and people watch. Overall Impression -- Having just received a giftcard to CTB, I'm looking forward to putting it to good use. There is an enormous menu with a variety of bagel sandwiches, vegan friendly items, new soups made daily, and even some smoothies. I'm very interested in trying out as many unique items as possible. It's a Collegetown favorite and with good reason!
Not sure if it's supposed to taste bad, but the sweet tart smoothie is super disappointing. It tastes like just orange juice and yogurt.

But then I could see how you could burn out on bagels, sandwiches and bagel sandwiches after coming here so much due to its enticing menu, availability of coffee drinks and convenient location and come to wish it could be another kinda of breakfast/coffee/lunch location for just a day - just for some variety. However, since I only had to chance to visit it once, I'm a fan and wish I could transplant it to SF for my own selfish reasons.
My favorite place for food in all of Ithaca. It can get super crowded whenever parents are visiting Cornell, but that's just a testament to how great their sandwiches are. The staff is always very friendly and helpful, and they have a regularly-changing list of specialty coffee drinks that are almost always tasty.
How I wish this place was available in NYC.  Apple cider when in season... and the chai tea... soo good.  Every type of bagel or wrap you can imagine.  Fast and efficient service.
I loved the rosemary salt bagel and the cayuga cocoa.  We'll be back next time we're in the area!
Lovingly known as CTB to locals, collegetown bagels is a place i surely miss since leaving Cornell. I'm not even that crazy of a bagel person but this place is awesome. You can get nearly any sandwich imaginable on a bagel and there are a few unique combinations i havent seen anywhere. In addition to all those bagel combinations they also offer a lot of ny deli sandwiches which are all extremely delicious. A few of my favorites are the mexican bagel which is a bagel with salsa lots of cream cheese, then heated in the oven with cheese on top so it comes out sorta like a pizza its delicious. The pancho villa is pretty good as well (chicken breast, avocado, salsa, jalapeno). They also make very good deli sandwiches. This place rocks!
my all time favorite place for breakfast and lunch: collegetown bagels. oh man, i think i used to come here at least once or twice each day. the bronx (sausage and egg) on a sun-dried tomato bagel with swiss was my favie. that, and the vegetarian sandwich (veggie cream cheese, tomato and muenster), again on a sun-dried tomato bagel. and ooh, how about the lox and cream cheese. man, those were the days. the days before i discovered i was lactose intolerant.
Collegetown Bagels, colloquially referred to as 'CTB', is my breakfast mecca. CTB serves, among other things, outstanding bagels - as well as sandwiches, including those of the vegan and organic variety, pastries, various coffee and espresso drinks, and even beer. Best Sandwich: Jonah's Jive + 1 bagels rival NYC in taste and quality + 1 sandwiches are healthy, interesting, filling + 1 captures the culture of Ithaca; rootsy, local, authentic + 1 beer license, funky and unusual drinks + 1 honey-walnut creamcheese -1 coffees are inferior to Starbucks; sangria tastes like bleach
A friend took me to a CTB lunch on a short visit to Cornell; at first I was overwhelmed then impressed. Thankfully she was there to guide me through the confusing process because there is a lot going on when you walk in - a loosely ordered chaos. It took me five minutes to get through their monstrous sandwich menu while trying to stay out of the way of those who knew what the hell was going on. I'm pretty sure you could eat here every day for a month and not repeat an order. The sheer volume of items they have for sale is astounding but over stimulated the senses. I could spend a good hour looking over everything they offer. I managed to successfully place my order, pay and head to the patio area. It was a beautiful day and there was a steady stream of activity outside making the patio a great place to be.  There is definitely a college vibe in this place, a great diversity of people and constant activity that makes it feel energized. The first bite of my Turkey Hill BLT was an explosion of awesomeness. With fresh ingredients and bread and healthy portions it's clear that CTB knows how to make a sandwich. It's unfortunate that this may be my only delicious experience.
My kinda place. Delicious, fast and has so many varieties. I had a hard time finding good places to eat at outside the Hilton garden inn but this frankly made my day. I had opa pizza bagel for lunch and it was delicious. More people need to post on yelp about restaurants around here. It helps people who are not from the area.
Bagels, sandwiches, baked goodies.  Something for everyone.  Very tasty.  Reasonably priced.
What a carbohydrate explosion! I go to CTB for two reasons, the bagels and beer... usually together. Now that I have moved out of Ithaca, I have realized how good I had it from a bagel standpoint. CTB's bagels were delicious! For an afternoon or evening bagel, I'd always opt for the pepperoni pizza bagel and it was always a homerun. Don't get me wrong, these bagels were insanely overpriced... but I don't care... it's CTB! The other reason I went to CTB was the beer. When I tell my non-Cornell friends about that, they're always puzzled. They don't get that my bagel store served beer, but it makes complete sense to me. Add beer to any establishment and it's a good idea. There is nothing better than a few pitchers with friends on the CTB patio on a warm spring day... or cool fall day for that matter... or maybe even a cold winter day with the heaters on. The way I'd work the pitcher situation is that I would leave whatever bar I was at around 12:40am and run straight to CTB. We'd grab a pitcher or two and some seats on the patio. This would give us enough time to finish them off before kicking you out around 1:20am or so... or at least taking your beer away. Remember: If you try to action this plan, CTB stops serving beer before the 1am last call... account for this time appropriately.
I really love this place! The bagels are really fantastic, on Bagel tuesdays I stock up and I am constantly eating their rosemary salt bagels. So good! I would give 5 stars if they made betters eggs for their breakfast sandwiches. They are obviously microwaved eggs, and it detracts from the otherwise delicious everything. This is really the only complaint I have. Just don't bother with the egg sandwiches there and you will be happy.
Collegetown Bagels (CTB) is hands down the most popular eatery in Collegetown if not Ithaca itself. If you're passing through it's great for a quick bite or if you're meeting with friends, a convenient spot for brunch/drinks. Breakfast bagels served all day! The Grub -- * Pumpkin Apple Bisque in a Bread Bowl ($5.50) * California Sunrise Bagel (Scrambled eggs with avocado, red onion & melted Pepper Jack cheese, on a plain bagel) ($4.75) Food Review -- I was looking forward to the Pumpkin Apple Bisque because I'm a sucker for seasonal specials. However, I watched as the waiter went outside first to try to find my table (they deliver your food to you) and it came to my table just lukewarm after being exposed to the frigid temperatures outside. Fortunately, the flavors were still intact and the chunks of apple made for a nice thick soup. The California Sunrise Bagel was alright, but the guacamole-like paste resembled a cheap store bought substitute and was not the "avocado" I was expecting. Service Review -- As a Collegetown favorite, CTB is used to a high volume of traffic especially in rushes as students try to grab a bite or a drink before class. That said, they are highly efficient and have a great flow, especially because of their streamlined method of ordering at one end of the restaurant, going through the cash register, and then picking up your order at the other end. The cashiers were cheerful Venue Review -- As mentioned earlier, the flow of traffic is great, which is a necessity because it is often packed with students. The layout is long and narrow, which makes it difficult to squeeze by other people in line if you're trying to get to the refrigerated items in the middle of the store. CTB is very cozy with both indoor and outdoor seating. It's a great spot to grab a quick bite or to sit on the barstools by the window and people watch. Overall Impression -- Having just received a giftcard to CTB, I'm looking forward to putting it to good use. There is an enormous menu with a variety of bagel sandwiches, vegan friendly items, new soups made daily, and even some smoothies. I'm very interested in trying out as many unique items as possible. It's a Collegetown favorite and with good reason!
bagel+cat= happy bagel cat!

you are responsible for my awful coffee addiction and 8% of my CU graduate student loans (which is now indirectly owed to the chinese) why must you hire such a smoking hot tattooed black haired girl? you take advantage of my weakness

To be honest, CTB is overpriced for what it serves but it will always be a collegetown essential. It's the most convenient place to go to meet up with friends for a quick lunch, and the only place with a lot of outdoor seating for those few weeks when the weather is nice. Ordering a sandwich with a drink will easily rack up for $20 though, so I usually get their pastries more. I'm a carbivore. My fave pastries are their crescent cookies and croissants.

DeWitt Melt. Do it.
Yum!  There is so much on the menu, it's hard to narrow it down because they all sound so delicious! I ended up ordering the West end specialty sandwich and subbed out the bread with a rosemary salt bagel.  The west end is made of rare roast beef (yeah...it really is rare...some of the bloody goodness was oozing out of the bagel), tomato, cheddar cheese and honey mustard.  The rosemary salt bagel is what really made a great sandwich rise to greatness.  The medly of rosemary with meat is always a winner.
The closest food to Cornell campus.  Almost everything here is alright, but I feel the place is generally overrated or overpriced.  I think most people come for ivy-league pre-law sandwich lounge vibe. That said it's somewhat of an institution and is definitely worth checking out and sitting down at.
CTB, the stuff that dreams and nightmares are made of. On the one hand, the one near the Commons often had the friendliest of employees and delicious of bagels, but was also typically stuffed with the obnoxious children of Cornell teachers each attempting to prove the other was far more intellectual over chai or something pitifully cliche like that. Either that or screaming infants. And I'm not sure, but I don't think "bagels" and "screaming infants" were meant to go together, unless you live on some exotic and cannibalistic island wherein you consume children on bagels instead of cream cheese or lox. On the other hand, the one along Route 13 often had a line during lunch hours that may have actually had to extend out the door and almost all the way to Purity ice cream, some days. Same quality food, but a wait you could grow a beard during. On the third hand, because I'm some sort of tri-armed mutant, the one up to Collegetown actually had Cornell people in it, and I can't say as I approve of that. Like all things, Cornellians must be taken in moderation, otherwise you're going to get a migraine and then have to have a good sit and read something shallow to feel like someone tried to cram your brain chock-full of pretentious. In other words; I love CTB, but I really don't like people.
The food is great.  The location is great but I don't love the attitude of the staff.  Not exactly nice to people who are not regulars and are not down with the program on where to line up and where to pick up.  I bought breakfast there for three days and didn't see a smile.  I don't need attitude from people who weren't born yet when I ate at CTB.  BTW, it was Olivers back then,  CTB was in the t shirt shop.
This place has an amazing assortment of breakfast sandwiches. I was visiting Ithaca for two nights, and both mornings I visited CTB for the Cayuga croissant - a croissant with avocado, tomato, mushroom, sprouts, and a delicious garlic dressing. Amazing sandwich, can't stop thinking about it. Also great spots indoors and outdoors for sitting with free wifi. Good assortment of morning drinks as well. I will be back!
I was in Ithaca for a weeding and hit up Collegetown bagels on a friend's recommendation. I went twice and had the same thing - sesame bagel with nova lox and cream cheese. The quality of the bagel and the salmon are great. The staff was, for the most part, really friendly and helpful with the giant wall menu. It's definitely crowded inside and busy so I took mine to go both days. If ever I'm in Ithaca again, I'll definitely be back.
I love CTB! I come here several times a week, at least! They have the perfect array of foods and drinks for whatever you're craving. Breakfast bagels, a mind-boggling variety of sandwiches, delicious soups, take out boxes of salads and dumplings, pastries to die for... and that's just the food! As for drinks... beers on tap, beers in pitchers, beers in bottles, sangria, tea, coffees with awesome what-you'd-expect-from-college names, hot chocolates, smoothies, and giant fridges of juices... try it all, everything is delicious. But besides all that, they have BBQs in front (which are delicious), and also Bagel Tuesdays - you get a dozen bagels a certain Tuesday of every month for $5. Great deal. It's also a wonderful "college" atmosphere, as well as a fun place to people watch. The staff are friendly and helpful - one late night, I was helping a friend recover from the flu. He parked the car in front of CTB, handed me $20 and told me to get him "food and pastries". I ran inside, asked the staff for their recommendations of 2 vegetarian sandwiches, then had them pick whatever pastries they wanted, as long as it added up to $20. They had fun, I ended up paying pretty close to around that, and they gave me some flu busting tea for free. I couldn't live without this place!
Yummy baked goods and great sandwiches!
CTB!! I love their bagels. I MISS their bagels. Their sandwiches are AWESOME. I used to have one that I would reward myself with if I ever did well on a prelim (or if a certain boy never called, I needed something to console myself with). I forget what it was called - but it was cole slaw, sliced tomato, and melted provolone cheese on a bialy - only I'd get it on a Long Island (an everything bagel - I believe so called a "Long Island" because Long Islanders want everything). And it was... drip-down-the-front-of-your-shirt heavenly. As was their cheesecake brownie. You heard right. Cheesecake brownie. Bottom was a fudgey brownie, top was a creamy cheesecake. Cue orgasm.
Visiting Ithaca for two weeks and, of course, Collegetown Bagels was the top recommendation of the locals.  I have to say, the food is good, no doubt about it - but the system is completely frustrating.  There is no good signage as to what you should do if you have the audacity to want both a bagel sandwich *and* coffee.  And this was not just me - I actually bonded with another newcomer who was equally befuddled by the insanity.  In the end, we both stood in a total of three lines to accomplish our feat.  Good sandwich, yes.  Need some work on signage, yes please.

I will start by saying that my actual meal doesn't necessarily merit five stars.  I had the "Veganic" wrap- tofu scramble, avocado, scallions, and mushrooms (I had mine without mushrooms).  It was extraordinarily messy and drippy and was just sort of forgettable in terms of flavor.  It wasn't bad, it was just decent.  However, this place is really cute and they have a crazy extensive menu and everything sounded pretty amazing and they had a ton of vegan options.  Bagels, wraps, sandwiches, tons of topping choices, baked goods, coffee drinks, juices.  Whatever breakfastly treats you could wish for (besides waffles, but leave that to Waffle Frolic :D).  I definitely recommend it despite my mediocre sammich.
A staple of Ithaca. If you are in Ithaca, you HAVE to go. Best bagels in New York possibly? Very creative in their options. Awesome vibe too!
I had high hopes for this place since my daughter is coming here next week but I was definitely disappointed. The bagel was pretty bad and that was after the woman at the counter acted like I was ignorant for not knowing that they cal an "everything" bagel a "Long Island Bagel." Several of the folks working there seemed pretty grumpy. The coffee was just so-so. Perhaps it was an off day, but based on my experience it's a 2 star joint.

Not sure if it's supposed to taste bad, but the sweet tart smoothie is super disappointing. It tastes like just orange juice and yogurt.
Finally, a place with "peanut butter and banana on a bagel" as a menu item!!! There are a few bagels here that I didn't understand at first, like "Long Island Wheat," which means an everything wheat bagel. I got a peanut butter and jelly on a bagel, and I loved that it came open-faced in a long rectangular cardboard box! I didn't spend too much time looking at the lunch menu, fearful that it would take me a half hour to choose a sandwich that I wasn't ready for at 9am. There's a sweet 15 minute unloading spot right in front of the place - I'm not sure if it's ok to use as an in-and-out customer, but it worked great on a Thursday morning.
An all-purpose sandwich/coffee/bake shop with a dizzying selection of sandwiches, drinks, pastries, and snacks, both hot and cold. Pretty much all the sandwiches are tasty and well-crafted, and more filling than they look. Service is quick and friendly. It's not what I would call cheap cheap, but prices are decent for Collegetown.

As an official Cornell alumnus of two years now stuck in Dallas, TX, I am constantly missing good ole CTB. Late night crazy drunken pastry cravings (is that even a thing?)? I can rely on CTB to be open and convince my under-the-influence brain to shell out a few bucks for those dessert stone cookies. Or that fruit tart. Or the marjolaine. Or, oh God, so many decisions! If sweet tooth is just not your thing, the bagel sandwiches are well thought out and well worth the expense (Oh, New York, why are you so expensive?) To try: the Lindsey, my go to sandwich. The big apple, a close second. The Renwick Reuben. And pretty much everything else on their menu. Some of my major regrets after leaving Cornell is that I never did jump off the stone bridge into the gorges, and that I haven't eaten enough at CTB.
Overpriced. The staff is generally pretty rude and the bagels are not as good as Brueggers. The desserts are pretty good and they have a great selection of sandwiches and drinks. The outdoor seating is nice but the beer should be cheaper.

I loved the rosemary salt bagel and the cayuga cocoa.  We'll be back next time we're in the area!
I love CTB. They have so many options for sandwiches, but it is on the pricey side of things. My favorite sandwiches are Zabs and Autumn Sky.
The go-to place for Cornell students.  Some favorites: sweet rachel or the ctblt.  DONT drink the coffee though.  It tastes like gasoline.  Stick with the bagel combos or a sandwich and get your coffee at the starbucks around the corner.  Also a good place to grab a beer with friends after classes and sit outside.
CTB!! I love their bagels. I MISS their bagels. Their sandwiches are AWESOME. I used to have one that I would reward myself with if I ever did well on a prelim (or if a certain boy never called, I needed something to console myself with).

From morning to midnight, CTB has it all. You can have a bagel sandwich and fancy-coffee-drink-thing for breakfast (or lunch or dinner or midnight snack!) or pretty much anything off of the Ithaca Bakery menu. The CTBLT is my favorite - a BLT plus avacado and ailoi on toasted sourdough. Yes, it is as good as it sounds. They also have a good variety of desserts and whatnot, again from Ithaca Bakery. Plus they serve beer and the outdoor seating is prized real estate when the weather is nice. Basically, if you wrote down everything a college kid's all-day, all-purpose hangout spot should have, you would end up describing CTB. It might seem a bit cliche, but its damn good!
great sandwich place, with surprisingly good pastries/cookies. i am a fan of the california dreamin (turkey, coleslaw, avocado on wheat) and potter's pick.
A staple of Ithaca. If you are in Ithaca, you HAVE to go. Best bagels in New York possibly? Very creative in their options. Awesome vibe too!

I've been here a few times. I really love their cheesecake brownies. Probably a little calorie intensive, but wow are they worth it.... at least every once in awhile. If you're in the mood for a snack with some coffee this is a good place to go.
Bagels, sandwiches, baked goodies.  Something for everyone.  Very tasty.  Reasonably priced.

It's interesting that in a town full of college students the most happening place appears to be a bagel shop.  Granted, it's no ordinary bagel shop as I discovered.  First sign of that was the outside patio full of young people drinking beer...at a bagel shop.  The second sign was the giant screen inside broadcasting a World Cup game, making it a little crowded for those of us who were actually trying to order. I ate here a few times during my brief stay in Ithaca and though I thought my lox bagel sandwich was good (not great b/c it was a little salty and came with WAY too much cream cheese -- I scraped off a good inch of that stuff!), I really liked the smoothies. Service was very friendly.  Prices were pretty reasonable.  I liked that they compost their waste.  Nice selection of pastries, beverages, and snacks. Nice location to campus.   I can see why this place is happenin'!

If you're at Cornell, you will have to eat here. It's not an option haha. I would recommend foodwise the TUSCAN VERDER HOT! Best sandwich ever! I ordered this so much the guy recognizes me as the Tuscan verde guy haha.   autumn sky (with chipotle sauce) and the west side melt are also pretty good . Coffeewise, I like the Twisted Sister and Karamel Kozzie; they both taste awesome! It's actually not that keep here; you'll spend like 6-7 bucks on the sandwiches alone and then  a drink so you could spend like 10+ bucks for one meal. But it's worth it. They also have the new Bling feature where you sign up and get 10 bucks for free to spend (as credit) on meals. Essentially it's a glorified sticker on your phone that acts like a credit card wirelessly. They also have a bar here at night; it typically closes at 2 am. Go now!
DeWitt Melt. Do it.

A place to grab coffee, teas, smoothies, sandwiches and drinks. They have an extensive selection of sandwiches to choose from. You can have breakfast anytime of the day. My personal favorites are BLT with avocado and California dreamin. They also have some tasty Sangria and a solid bottle and tap to choose from with some solid daily deals.
Yummy baked goods and great sandwiches!
From morning to midnight, CTB has it all. You can have a bagel sandwich and fancy-coffee-drink-thing for breakfast (or lunch or dinner or midnight snack!) or pretty much anything off of the Ithaca Bakery menu. The CTBLT is my favorite - a BLT plus avacado and ailoi on toasted sourdough. Yes, it is as good as it sounds. They also have a good variety of desserts and whatnot, again from Ithaca Bakery. Plus they serve beer and the outdoor seating is prized real estate when the weather is nice. Basically, if you wrote down everything a college kid's all-day, all-purpose hangout spot should have, you would end up describing CTB. It might seem a bit cliche, but its damn good!
I had high hopes for this place since my daughter is coming here next week but I was definitely disappointed. The bagel was pretty bad and that was after the woman at the counter acted like I was ignorant for not knowing that they cal an "everything" bagel a "Long Island Bagel." Several of the folks working there seemed pretty grumpy. The coffee was just so-so. Perhaps it was an off day, but based on my experience it's a 2 star joint.
I used to think their prices were out of control when I was in school, but since then I've lived in DC, LA and SF.  They were a freakin' steal. Yeah, I could've gone to The Greek House and gotten a cheap, full breakfast,  but then you couldn't commune with the other students studying and this was the best meeting spot in Collegetown.   Favorite sandwich was The Sweet Rachel: pumpernickel, turkey, muenster, red onion and that spicy sweet mustard.  Breakfast bagels were always a must with a small, round jar of Martinelli's apple juice.
An all-purpose sandwich/coffee/bake shop with a dizzying selection of sandwiches, drinks, pastries, and snacks, both hot and cold. Pretty much all the sandwiches are tasty and well-crafted, and more filling than they look. Service is quick and friendly. It's not what I would call cheap cheap, but prices are decent for Collegetown.
I've been here a few times. I really love their cheesecake brownies. Probably a little calorie intensive, but wow are they worth it.... at least every once in awhile. If you're in the mood for a snack with some coffee this is a good place to go.
Overpriced. The staff is generally pretty rude and the bagels are not as good as Brueggers. The desserts are pretty good and they have a great selection of sandwiches and drinks. The outdoor seating is nice but the beer should be cheaper.
It's interesting that in a town full of college students the most happening place appears to be a bagel shop.  Granted, it's no ordinary bagel shop as I discovered.  First sign of that was the outside patio full of young people drinking beer...at a bagel shop.  The second sign was the giant screen inside broadcasting a World Cup game, making it a little crowded for those of us who were actually trying to order. I ate here a few times during my brief stay in Ithaca and though I thought my lox bagel sandwich was good (not great b/c it was a little salty and came with WAY too much cream cheese -- I scraped off a good inch of that stuff!), I really liked the smoothies. Service was very friendly.  Prices were pretty reasonable.  I liked that they compost their waste.  Nice selection of pastries, beverages, and snacks. Nice location to campus.   I can see why this place is happenin'!
The go-to place for Cornell students.  Some favorites: sweet rachel or the ctblt.  DONT drink the coffee though.  It tastes like gasoline.  Stick with the bagel combos or a sandwich and get your coffee at the starbucks around the corner.  Also a good place to grab a beer with friends after classes and sit outside.
The food was better than I expected, but there were a couple things that were just a little "off" about the place. It's cheap, but amount of food for your buck was a little disappointing. Yes, it costs less than $10/person, but this isn't "cheap restaurant." It's "moderately-priced restaurant with small-ish amounts of food to keep their costs down." I had the medusa wrap -- an unexpected combination of Indian curry with eggs and spinach that was extremely good. I also had a chocolate-filled pastry for $2.25, but noticed that the girl rang it up for $2.75 (they entered all the numbers by hand, from memory, for every menu item) -- I asked for a receipt (yes, I had to ask!) in order to confirm the error, but it was an unitemized receipt, and I decided to drop it because the place was uncomfortably crowded and the girl had moved on to the next one in line. The dessert wasn't mind-blowing, but it was decent. If I'm in the area, I might eat there again, or, heck, I might go down to the new Five Guys Burgers that just opened!
great sandwich place, with surprisingly good pastries/cookies. i am a fan of the california dreamin (turkey, coleslaw, avocado on wheat) and potter's pick.
If you're at Cornell, you will have to eat here. It's not an option haha. I would recommend foodwise the TUSCAN VERDER HOT! Best sandwich ever! I ordered this so much the guy recognizes me as the Tuscan verde guy haha.   autumn sky (with chipotle sauce) and the west side melt are also pretty good . Coffeewise, I like the Twisted Sister and Karamel Kozzie; they both taste awesome! It's actually not that keep here; you'll spend like 6-7 bucks on the sandwiches alone and then  a drink so you could spend like 10+ bucks for one meal. But it's worth it. They also have the new Bling feature where you sign up and get 10 bucks for free to spend (as credit) on meals. Essentially it's a glorified sticker on your phone that acts like a credit card wirelessly. They also have a bar here at night; it typically closes at 2 am. Go now!
CTB charcterizes Ithaca so well! Authentic crowd, laid back vibe, very eco-friendly, awesome selection of food that accommodates a variety of diets and tastes. Their menu can be overwhelming, so you just have to focus and zone in on what you will and won't have. CTB has the best coffee that I've ever had, and I've had a lot of coffee! CTB is in a great location to the Cornell campus. If you live in Collegetown, it's easy to stop by and grab your grub as you head to class or return afterwards to hang out and study. It is popular, so you just have to be aware that space is limited.
A place to grab coffee, teas, smoothies, sandwiches and drinks. They have an extensive selection of sandwiches to choose from. You can have breakfast anytime of the day. My personal favorites are BLT with avocado and California dreamin. They also have some tasty Sangria and a solid bottle and tap to choose from with some solid daily deals.
Almost everyone loves this place as a late night food option. It opens from early in the morning till late in the night. It really serves pretty much all a college student's needs on food and drinks. My favorite bagel is Bronx or Brooklyn on rosemary salt. There was this one time that I got a banana split smoothie. It was amazingly good! I even told my friend that this is going to be my best drink here in Ithaca. However, I never get the same banana split smoothie again... Last time when I ordered it, it was not even a smoothie but a weird tasted coffee... Also, even at 2 am, CTB can still be a place that too noisy for a chat with friends...

A fine bagel not fine service. Ordering a bagel at CTB is like a moat between the bourgeois and the proletariat. Master you have a customer! Staff: No one disturbs me while I'm working. CTB serves its patrons like a gated community and simultaneously explains their superioity through the depths and difficulty to complete an order for a coffee and bagel. If time =  money, the bagel and coffe should be almost free. Thereby you are paying to much and spending alot time at CTB. The greatest concentrations of hipsters can be found at CTB if thats your thing, Williamsburg North, except in Williamsburg you can purchase and enjoy a tasty bagel on the cheap (with a smile). Don't forget to say hello to the lululemon girls.
CTB is great, it's fast, it's convenient, it tastes pretty good. However, know that sometimes the sandwiches/bagel sandwiches/wraps, whatever, are a little bit bland. It's okay though, CTB, I forgive you because you're... CTB and you have a cult following and everyone's probably going to hate on me if I don't. It's super overpriced, everyone will agree. I could probably go to Wegman's and by a whole package of bagels, cream cheese, lox, and other stuff for probably less than I pay for one measly bagel. I have a big appetite, but I'm not unreasonable. -1 Star for price. I would give it 3.5 stars, but too bad there's no half star option. -.5 Stars for slightly bland sandwiches (you might want to get an everything bagel because those have salt on it to help the taste). I've come here a lot. I'm not a coffee fiend, but the coffee is supposed to be great. The lox bagel, nutella bagel w/ bananas, the pizza bagels, chicken melt, california sunrise, mmmm ALL GOOD. Long Island Wheat is a solid bagel choice for your sandwich or I love Everything bagels too. Just don't be like me at CTB and get lost staring at that humongous menu of their's. Last time I stood there for like ten minutes drooling.

Good food and drinks but a bit on the expensive side. I'll be honest, the bagels here are among the best I have ever had. After trying to make bagels at home, I realize the work that goes in to making consistently good bagels. The sandwiches are really good but tend to be expensive, especially for common ingredients. The flavors and quality of those ingredients rarely disappoint though. The beer selection is OK, but like the bagels and sandwiches, its a bit on the expensive side. The best part of CTB is sitting on the patio drinking a beer in the summer. Simply perfect! When friends come in from out of town, I bring them here for a drink.

My dad owns a couple bagel shops in Manhattan, so I should know a thing or two about bagels. Curious which bagel shop? Here: yelp.com/biz/bagel-expre… Sure the bagels aren't the size of Shaq's palms but it's worth it (it's in your favor, you don't need to run the extra carbs off). I ended up having the California Sunrise sandwich and added ham on a thyme and salt bagel. Great breakfast sandwich at such a cheap price! Things like that won't sell at that price in the city. They unfortunately ran out of the banana nut bagel, but that'll be worth a try next time.

There is a lot going on here...perhaps too much?  I walked in thinking that I would get a simple sandwich on a bagel only to find that there is no such thing as simple at Collegetown Bagels.  So after exploring the menu for a few minutes, I decided on the veganic (tofu scramble, avacado, and veggies).  The wrap was decent.  The tofu could have had a little bit more flavor, but it was enjoyable nonetheless.  I have a feeling if I were in Ithaca for a longer period of time, this place would become a standard once I found the menu items that I really liked.  But as a first time/one time visitor, I was quite overwhelmed and did not know which direction to go.   Just as an additional note, they had lots of dessert, ice cream, coffee creation options as well.

This place represents college delights--both culinary and socially. Their bagels are above any other bagel you'll ever have, and their sandwiches are a class unto themselves. But for whatever reason, I like this place best at night; they have a courtyard lit up with those round-ball lights and outdoor tables, and I just love the warm glow and yummy smells that drift out into the street--summer or winter. A good number of tables, this is the optimal lunch-study place, though it can get crowded very quickly at peak times. The up-side to that, is that you'll always know at least one other person inside since almost everyone goes here. CTB is also handily located across the street from the bus stop; grab a bagel while you're waiting for the No. 11 T-Cat to take you back up to the IC campus.

Biggest =) THE place to go and have a pitcher of whatever with your friends.  They have great outdoor seating to people watch and hang out.  Problem is there are only two months out of the school year that you can do this. Biggest =( It's pricey.  For the price they serve food at, I could walk down the street to Apollo and grab double the food, which I typically do. Even though it's expensive, you should at least try some of their bagel sandwiches.  The sausage, egg, and cheese is scrumptious, as is the traditional lox and cream cheese. Ultimately I just hit this place up in september and april/may to grab a pitcher of sangria with a few friends.

CTB has the best location in Collegetown, and is open from early in the morning till 2am. Those are its primary attractive characteristics. The bagels are decent, but pale in comparison to a good bagel from any real deli in NYC. I've never understood why there are so few places that can make a bagel that has a thin skin on the outside and a fluffy, creamy inside. These bagels taste like a generic bagel you'd find anywhere else in the US. Wegmans fresh bagels are better. Its EXPENSIVE. The sandwiches are small and overpriced. I understand that they have to pay the highest rent per sq/ft outside of NYC in New York State (or so I've been told), but its really just not worth the money. And their sandwiches aren't really that good - they have cute names, but none of them are that inspired or unique. Drinks are expensive, but its worth it so you can sit outside and "see and be seen" by friends passerby. Even though I gripe about it, still end up spending considerable time there, just because its such an institution. If you want really good sandwiches for much less, check out Gorgers right by the Commons - they deliver! Also CTB doesn't accept Amex..

Fantastic! Cornell and Ithaca staple.  You will see everyone you know here, guaranteed. Staff is super friendly and will actually make you any sandwich requested.  The food is fantastic and there are tons of vegetarian and vegan options.  My favorites- the Sandiego Bagel, Medusa Wrap, Viva Chelsea, Last Strand, California Sunrise Bagel, Rosemary Salt + Veggie Lite cream cheese.  Really though, you can't go wrong. Sangria pitchers when the weather is warm are fantastic.  Great smoothies and espresso as well.  Open til 2am in C-town (and I think 3am now on Fri and Sat), so great pit stop post-bars or if you're studying late.  On occasion they have live music, outdoor events, and even trivia (used to do Harry Potter trivia my freshman year, the intensity actually got out of control so they stopped it).  Also $5 dozens Tuesday! Pastries, cheese selection, and grab and go stuff also of high quality.  Most is from the sister Ithaca Bakery which I also recommend.  Get the yogurt parfait if on the run and want something filling and healthy! East Hill and Downtown locations close much earlier and don't have quite the same bustling atmosphere (still good though), but also have a salad bar MUST MUST MUST GO!!!  BEST BAGELS IN TOWN & DEFINITELY A CLASSIC NY BAGEL (made the old fashion and correct way- boiled first).

I visited a friend at Cornell this past weekend, and he told me that CTB is one of the most popular, well known places in Ithaca. First impression while walking in the store--holy crap there're a lot of menu items. Definitely a bit overwhelming for your every day passerbyer. I could see how being a regular would be awesome though. But anyways, there was definitely a large variety of options. On top of all the different combinations of bagels that were offered, they also offered I would guess about 15+ different types of bagels that could be used for your bagel sandwiches. There are also regular sandwiches, salads, etc; definitely a good place to go to if someone needs a quick bite. I got the Novie on Cheese which was essentially an egg salad with smoked salmon and red onions. The bagel itself was super warm and toasty although to be honest, I was more focused on how fresh and delicious the smoked salmon was. Mm! I also got a White Hot Chocolate which is definitely something that I've never heard of before. It's an easy enough spin on a typical Hot Chocolate recipe that tastes much, much better than regular hot chocolates. That being said, giving it a 4 because it's a decent good place. Can't definitely say it's the best in the area since I'm not from Ithaca, but it's definitely pretty good. tldr; want a yummy quick bite? go

I went once around 1:30a.m. They ran out of bagels! But, they recommended vegetarian cream cheese on baguette bread. It was really good to the point that it should not be vegetarian (no offense to vegetarians- i'm just a big meat lover) Great price too!

I really love how this place has quite a few vegetarian and vegan options, as a vegan with a dairy allergy it is important.  Also, this is one of the few restaurants in "progressive" Ithaca that composts, despite a subsidy from Tompkins County Solid Waste that will pay for HALF the cost of Cayuga Compost for the first year. What I have noticed for some time though is that there are many many items that are not priced. No price on individual packages, that's fine. But no price on the shelf/rack or on the box? How much are the Luna bars? the "Primal Strips" jerky? the hummus?CTB both in Ctown and downtown is in effect sort-of tricking people into buying things because they don't know the price. This doesn't seem very fair. It is also a burden to the staff who instead of making the sandwiches or ringing out people had to answer price questions and scan each item--because they didn't know the prices either.  What a hassle for me AND other customers who had to wait unnecessarily.  I would have rated a 4+ if not for this foolish pricing strategy.

You get what you pay for with CTB, and by that I mean you get convenience and competently prepared and overly imaginatively-named sandwich and beverage staples at severe prices. That said, going to CTB is very often worth it. Time is money, and if the extra 30 minutes spent studying rather than preparing a sandwich helps you pass an exam required en route to a career that pays well, or gives you 30 minutes of sleep-time during a hectic time of the semester: CTB is the place to go. Also, Cornellians flock to the CTB patio to celebrate whenever the sun actually comes out and it's above 50 degrees out. Personal favorites: 1. Jonas Jive 2. California Sunrise 3. Sangria 4. Apple crisp 5. Desert-stone cookies
As the name of the restaurant implies, they have great bagels. But it's oh so much more. The sandwich and breakfast menus take up the ENTIRE length of the restaurant and offer something for everybody, from meat lovers to vegetarians. And it's not just the bagels that are homemade, the bread is baked by their parent company, the Ithaca Bakery. Yummy!

Still as delicious as ever. Love the sunrise on croissant and chai tea latte!
I went once around 1:30a.m. They ran out of bagels! But, they recommended vegetarian cream cheese on baguette bread. It was really good to the point that it should not be vegetarian (no offense to vegetarians- i'm just a big meat lover) Great price too!
They have sooooo many sandwiches, bagels, ready-to-go meals, desserts, etc. All of the CTB locations in Ithaca get their ingredients fresh daily from the Ithaca Bakery. Very vegetarian/vegan friendly. As a native Ithacan, sometimes I wish I had chosen to go to Cornell because I miss this place so much. But I can only deal with so many Ithaca winters! CTB makes bombass bagel sandwiches and AWESOME SANDWICHES. They have so many creative varieties. I always get the Viva Chelsea (fresh mozzarella cheese with fresh basil, tomato, extra-virgin olive oil, salt and pepper on rosemary focaccia bread, $6.35). It is simple, yet sooooo delicious. Just perfect. This place is just perfect for college students who want a quick, extremely delicious, inexpensive meal. I wish there were CTBs near all college campuses!

Yum! I love this place!! It's sort of "hippie"-ish in terms of style and decor and the people working there are v. granola, but I love it. The coffee is super fresh and amazing and the bagels are really delicious. I'm used to New York City bagels so I'm always skeptical and was nervous about spending 4 years at college without good bagels. However, they make really good chewy, chubby, fluffy bagels (and bialy). The flavored cream  cheeses are really good too. Their sandwiches are really good too (though, sometimes I feel silly saying the names). There's one sandwich with roast beef, honey mustard (with a real kick), and muenster cheese on pumpernickel which I thought was really really good. I love the California bagel as well (which has avocado, pepperjack cheese, and scrambled egg). It's super vegetarian (and vegan) friendly and they offer ready made salads and wraps and sandwiches as well if you don't have time to wait in line (because sometimes the line is super long). But they're really quick and it moves relatively quickly. They also have beer (in the evenings) and sangria (all the time) so it's a nice place to hang out. You can sit outside too (weather permitting). Love this place :)
You get what you pay for with CTB, and by that I mean you get convenience and competently prepared and overly imaginatively-named sandwich and beverage staples at severe prices. That said, going to CTB is very often worth it. Time is money, and if the extra 30 minutes spent studying rather than preparing a sandwich helps you pass an exam required en route to a career that pays well, or gives you 30 minutes of sleep-time during a hectic time of the semester: CTB is the place to go. Also, Cornellians flock to the CTB patio to celebrate whenever the sun actually comes out and it's above 50 degrees out. Personal favorites: 1. Jonas Jive 2. California Sunrise 3. Sangria 4. Apple crisp 5. Desert-stone cookies
A cute, quirky little place with a lot of personality.  It's definitely one of those shops you have to hit up to complete any Cornell/Ithaca experience.  The colorful, mural of a menu was overwhelming, but promised an endless array of delicious goodies.  They had so many seasonal things that involved pumpkin (my heart was all aflutter at the descriptions of pumpkin milkshakes, lattes, teas, bagels, cream cheese!! aahh!!) and I couldn't decide for the longest time.  I ended up trying their veganic wrap on a honey wheat bagel and a pumpkin bagel smothered in heavenly blissful amazing pumpkin cream cheese.  Did I mention the cream cheese was delicious?  I also tried some of the vegetarian bagel (holy cheesy yum) and a bite of cookie.  Everything was soooo gooooooood. I would need another lifetime to finish trying everything I want to at CTB.  I will be back one day!
As the name of the restaurant implies, they have great bagels. But it's oh so much more. The sandwich and breakfast menus take up the ENTIRE length of the restaurant and offer something for everybody, from meat lovers to vegetarians. And it's not just the bagels that are homemade, the bread is baked by their parent company, the Ithaca Bakery. Yummy!
LOVE this place!! So many options!! What to choose??? They have seats outside and inside. Great to eat here anytime and any day. Try something different when you come! I ordered: Tofutti veggie cream cheese bagel on a long island honey wheat bagel - love the bagel but it needed more cream cheese! Veganic on a California bagel - needed ketchup! Great proportion of filling to bread. Great sizes, good prices, lots of options, what could go wrong? The line goes fast too!
Still as delicious as ever. Love the sunrise on croissant and chai tea latte!
Not a huge fan of the food at this place. I give it 4 stars  for being such a fun place, employees with good attitudes. fast food in the morning near campus and reasonable prices.  I plan to go back there again when I am in college town. I hung out there a few times late at night, and you would have drunks at one table talking loudly and someone studying very intently 3 feet away. Maybe that interesting diversity is a Cornell thing? Anyway, from this parents point of view, this business personifies an ideal college off campus experience, very safe yet lively and entertaining at the same time.
They have sooooo many sandwiches, bagels, ready-to-go meals, desserts, etc. All of the CTB locations in Ithaca get their ingredients fresh daily from the Ithaca Bakery. Very vegetarian/vegan friendly. As a native Ithacan, sometimes I wish I had chosen to go to Cornell because I miss this place so much. But I can only deal with so many Ithaca winters! CTB makes bombass bagel sandwiches and AWESOME SANDWICHES. They have so many creative varieties. I always get the Viva Chelsea (fresh mozzarella cheese with fresh basil, tomato, extra-virgin olive oil, salt and pepper on rosemary focaccia bread, $6.35). It is simple, yet sooooo delicious. Just perfect. This place is just perfect for college students who want a quick, extremely delicious, inexpensive meal. I wish there were CTBs near all college campuses!
Tasty but definitely overpriced bagels and coffee. Make the same thing at home for half the price. Love the ambiance though, very hip and they play good music. It's usually pretty busy in here which is annoying but it's never such a big deal.
Yum! I love this place!! It's sort of "hippie"-ish in terms of style and decor and the people working there are v. granola, but I love it. The coffee is super fresh and amazing and the bagels are really delicious. I'm used to New York City bagels so I'm always skeptical and was nervous about spending 4 years at college without good bagels. However, they make really good chewy, chubby, fluffy bagels (and bialy). The flavored cream  cheeses are really good too. Their sandwiches are really good too (though, sometimes I feel silly saying the names).

I'm pretty sure CTB is one of the first places I went when I came to campus before classes started freshman year. And it was definitely one of the last places I went before leaving campus after graduation.  And I went plenty often in between :) Good for a bagel and coffee, quick snack, or a beer on the outdoor patio.  I especially love the vegetarian bagel (bagel with veggie cream cheese, tomato, melted muenster cheese) and the hot chocolate made with coffee.

As a native New Yorker it is hard not to be a total bagel snob.  What I had here was good. Not great but a solid "B" I liked how many options they had.  Great cream cheese flavors, pestos and cheeses.

Dammnit I live 2000 miles away and I still want a fricking CTB bagel. I'm not going to rate them on their sandwiches or their beer or how totally rad it is to hang out and be seen by other drunk college kids. Their bagels rock and ruin you for life, because every other bagel you buy is like circular wonder bread. They sell some bitching spreads too. Their herbed creamcheeses are awesome. They used to sell a smoked-salmon-salad that blew my mind, but I don't think they have it anymore.

I have been trying to teach bagel shops up and down the west coast how to make one of CTB's bagels with melted cheese for years.  I don't understand how hard it is to understand.  Take a bagel, split it, put cream cheese on it, throw some salsa or a tomato slice up on there, cover each slice with a piece of cheese and bake.  It's not difficult but it is oh so tasty.   My wife loves the Vegetarian Bagel - veggie cream cheese, tomato and melted Muenster - so much that she managed to have three of them in a four day visit.  One for lunch on Friday, one as a post bar snack on Saturday night and one for breakfast on Monday before we left town.
