My husband and I dined there last night.  We've wanted to try this place for some time and were not disappointed.  The atmosphere, service and food were all fantastic.  We started off with a crostini and the meatball appetizer.  Both delicious.  Then my husband had the chicken stew and I had the fusilli.  The chicken stew was the best my husband ever had and my meal was equally delicious.  Looking forward to return for another great meal.
Ate here last night with a dear friend and it is completely charming. We had a table by the french doors which were open and a perfect view of the walkway. It's so peaceful. Had a wonderful meal of tilefish over corn and wilted greens with a yummy creamy sauce. The wine was excellent. Agree with an earlier comment about the bread but the salted carmel chocolate tort was delicious! I will definitely be back! Love the way they do the chalk board specials.
OK let's start in order of importance. The food is excellent.  Maybe 7 of 10 on the price scale, (wine a bit higher than that) but absolutely delicious.  Next is the service - friendly, efficient, courteous.  First-rate.  The place, however, would benefit from a few adjustments, as most new businesses tend to find.  In no particular order: correct the misspellings on the chalk menu - there were several.  "Peprika", etc.  Add some acoustical tile to the ceiling and/or elsewhere. There will be crowds due to the quality of the the food, and the noise from conversation is troubling.  Clean the glass door that opens to the west!  Finally, add some blinds to the windows - the evening sun shines directly into the faces of people facing west.  So ... go enjoy a seriously good meal, and in the meantime face away from the window and sit very close to the person you most want to talk to.
There are much better options in this area for this type of dining, I'd skip this one!           Here's why: It started out nicely, the restaurant does have a lovely atmosphere, a lounge/bar area and a small dining room. The lighting is dimly set and makes for a romantic atmosphere though it was so loud I did have trouble hearing at points, both my date and the waiter. They were running behind "because of the snow" so we were happy to start with a drink in the lounge, to be fair we had just gotten an epic 2' of snow, it was a believable excuse at first.       I ordered a beer, one of my favorites, my fiancé ordered a mixed drink, it was way too sweet, but sometimes that happens. We didn't have to wait too long, they sat us at a small two top along the wall.       The hostess, who we guessed was an owner, said she'd be right back to tell us about the menu. We were obviously forgotten about. Finally, as I was about to go track down a server, she saw me looking around and sent someone over who apologized for the wait and took our wine order, we went with a disappointing bottle of red, but that wasn't their fault.      We first ordered one of their charcuterie boards, it was now past 9, we were hungry. When the server returned to take the rest of the order, we selected the spinach salad and two (way over-priced) pasta dishes, their "farm to table" selection was fairly limited that night thus our decision to go with pasta. Then we waited, and waited, and waited. The charcuterie board took over 45 minutes to come out, it was literally 3 types of cheese and 4 types of meat (that the server struggled to name) with a small bowl of cold roasted vegetables and olives, not hard to make, obviously we were forgotten again. After we finished that and it was cleared, we were waiting for the salad, the server came to tell us they were out of the spinach salad. This was now over an hour after we had ordered it, I know that mistakes happen but they were starting to add up at our table and it was showing us just an overall lack of organization from the kitchen, to the servers to the hostess.     When I went in search of the restroom, I walked into the full bar area and found the hostess (owner?) with her mouth full of food on the floor, not super professional. So she couldn't answer me when I asked where the restroom was.     Ok, last thing and then I'll stop my b*tching! The pasta dishes came out in a timely manner, my fiancé's was actually fairly tasty, though still WAY over priced but mine was disgusting. I ordered the mushroom ravioli, the ravioli itself was good but it came in a lemon, truffle oil broth that was so gross. There was no mention of lemon in the description on the menu but it was completely overpowering, plus, the flavor battle that was going on with the truffle oil was just a terrible experience.      My fiancé doesn't like to make a scene or complain in restaurants and I'm now regretting that I didn't say something. We took home the inedibles and gave them to the dog. She didn't complain! I do have to give them credit for acknowledging their mistake and taking the charcuterie board off our bill but we still spent a lot for a very disappointing evening.
Starting off as a review of the craft beer, it's top notch. Maybe the best selection of 8 taps in the region.  Super focused on local breweries and showcases the best beer that the Hudson Valley has to offer.  I don't know anything about wine but have to assume with the level of detail spent on the beer, equal time if not more was spent on the wine selection. For dinner, I had a pasta entree off the regular menu with an appetizer from the specials.  Both were very tasty and I certainly would go back, especially for the beer. Oh and you have to get dessert... I swear to you, leave room for dessert! For visitors to Poughkeepsie, I would suggest walking the pedestrian only bridge across the river. It was pretty spectacular, especially now during the fall.
Overall this is a fantastic newcomer to the growing culinary scene in the Poughkeepsie area. The building has been beautifully renovated, and the space is charming. The bar area is unique and comfortable with an excellent and fun selection of beer, drinks and of course, wine. We've tried several of their specialties and have not been disappointed. Strangely however, the only area where they seem to take a shortcut is with the bread. It is pedestrian at best and not worth the server's extra effort to deliver. All of the apps we have tried were great and dessert is not to be missed!! Try the milk and cookies and the amazing salted caramel tort. Perfect ending to a near perfect meal. We will return!
Very solid kitchen with focused but well prepared menu is complemented by value priced wine selections focusing more on price than Parker ratings. Fun spot. New "wine themed" dinners a good value ($65 prixe fixe w/ wine)  and gives the kitchen a chance to show off.
Kudos to Chef Brandon! We just left the Nic L Inn and had a DYNAMITE meal! We started off with the duck wings and pork bites....out of this world delicious! Then I had the chicken stew and my boyfriend had the pollock special....can't say enough great things about the food service! We will undoubtedly be back!
I tried. I tried again. It just got worse. Much worse. The Good: Beautiful, well thought out design. Atheistically impressive upon walking in the door. Nicely appointed touches--fresh flowers, candles, beautiful tabletops and linens. Warm and cozy. Friendly service. The Bad: Noisy. Not clean. Unpolished service (though friendly--explanations of dishes could not be articulated.) Curt hostess. No drink menu, confusing wine list that came with a long explanation from the hostess that we did not understand, limited bar drinks and VERY limited menu. The Ugly: INSANELY EXPENSIVE. If you are going to charge $26? for a carbonara, not only should it knock my socks off but it should be more than (literally) one cup of food. Really, just why that price for such a simple dish? It was fine. Just fine. When we got the bill, it was all rather shocking as we tend to not pay attention to the numbers when we decide we deserve a night out. Until the end, when it felt like the biggest gouge we've ever been stupid enough not to notice. Usually, we are only on guard to these types of gouging practices in tourist areas, where we look for the "off the beaten track" locals place. I just did not get it. Poughkeepsie is my hometown...does being 8 blocks up from the Hudson now constitute these prices? I should have been on alert when noticing the $39 steak. I would not recommend this place. I wanted to like it so badly, but the menu kind of reminds me of the things your mom would offer you to eat. Pasta. That's pretty much it. No appetizers, a few salads, and lots of pasta for lots of money. No thank you, I can do that at home. (Can you tell this place has irked me?)
Had our second dining experience tonight and it was better than the first.  I really can't believe this place has 1 star reviews, these reviewers must have extremely high standards.  The restaurant itself is very nice from a decor standpoint.  It's in an old building but they really added a lot of nice touches.  Starting from the beginning, they have a very large wine list with an extensive variety of wines, both by the glass and bottle.  They have about 15 wines that are $25 per bottle along with the others.  They also have 8 wines "on tap" where you can get a tasting portion, a half glass, a glass, or a carafe I believe.  They have about 8 craft beers, mostly local, in fact I believe everything they had was from a brewery within the Northeast.  My only complaint about the beer is that the taps didn't change in between our visits (about 3 weeks apart). I prefer a restaurant that rotates taps a little more frequently, but because its more of a wine bar, perhaps they don't have as much demand for the craft beer.  It is priced similar to other upscale establishments at $7 per glass.  Moving on to appetizers, they have artisan boards available (tuscan and local) along with salads, a soup (sugar pumpkin this season), and vegetables (broccoli rabe or delicata squash).  So far, in our 2 visits, we've had the spinach salad, the chicory salad, pumpkin soup, arancini (specials menu), and delicata squash.  All were fantastic.  The only negative I would have is that the spinach salad comes with a goat cheese croquette that is a little heavy on dill, but that's more of a personal preference.  Moving on to the main dishes, myself or my party has had every pasta dish on the menu with the exception of the bolognese and the red wine risotto.  Again, all the dishes were fantastic.  They offer both a half size and a full size portion.  Several members of our party choose to order 2 of the half sizes as their main dish and were fully satisfied with their servings.  I'm not sure why the complaint from another reviewer about the dishes being small, I don't believe that to be true at all.  Of all the pasta dishes that we sampled, our favorites would be the orechiette and the cavatelli.  Moving on to the desserts, I would have to say that their salted caramel chocolate tart is easily one of the best desserts that I have ever had.  It's served with a bacon infused whipped cream that just puts it over the top.  Words do not do it justice, you have to try it!  The bacon bourbon donuts are also very good, but honestly do not hold a candle to the tart.  I would go there just for the tart.  The only downside about dessert is that they do not have an espresso machine as of yet (the wait staff says they are working on it) and the coffee is a touch weak.  Lastly, the service is very good.  On our first trip there were two of us, so it was perfect then, but I always feel like the test comes with a larger group.  We dined the second time with 6 people and had a similar experience.  All our dishes came out warm.  Our water glasses were never empty.  Our waiter was there the second we took our last sip of beer/wine.  Overall, I would rank this as one of the top dining experiences in Poughkeepsie, right up there with Crew and Crave (among others).

Having dined at their old restaurant many years ago, I suggested to two colleagues that we give the new place a try for dinner. First, the good: The restaurant is in a lovely building and the interior is comfortable, contemporary and inviting. The bad: They were preoccupied and disorganized when we arrived and although we were the first ones there on a night on which they said no one had made reservations, they tried to seat us next to the noisy kitchen. The menu is very limited and rather pricey for what you get. There isn't even a green side salad available. The slice of bread served prior to the meal was cold and somewhat stale. The waiter was nice but couldn't really explain the evening's three specials. One of us had butternut squash tortellini; the other two had mushroom ravioli. The meals were good, but were lukewarm when served - especially the ravioli. We didn't want to disrupt the meal by sending it back, so we ate it. I wound up taking three out of the six or so home, as I wasn't enjoying them. The female owner stopped by when we were done, and we told her nicely that we were disappointed, and why. She said we were only the second table of customers that had complained since they opened. Really? She went on and on and said she hoped we'd give them another try. I suggested that if she gave us a gift certificate, we would do that. She then offered an after-dinner drink - which she should have done at the outset - but we declined. We so wanted to love the place - but for $95 for three small plates of tepid pasta and a bottle of nondescript wine, we'd suggest dining at one of the area's other fine restaurants.
OK let's start in order of importance. The food is excellent.  Maybe 7 of 10 on the price scale, (wine a bit higher than that) but absolutely delicious.  Next is the service - friendly, efficient, courteous.  First-rate.  The place, however, would benefit from a few adjustments, as most new businesses tend to find.  In no particular order: correct the misspellings on the chalk menu - there were several.  "Peprika", etc.  Add some acoustical tile to the ceiling and/or elsewhere.

I wouldn't go back after I heard the woman who I assume was a manager talking down to a waitress on her first nite there! That type of stuff should be handled in the back just very unclassy

Had a great meal here tonight along with four other guests. The staff was extremely helpful and knowledgable and the food was expertly prepared. We will definitely be back again. The bolognese and the halibut were both delicious, as were the tapenade crostini and the polpetti!

My wife and I enjoyed a late dinner (after 9 PM) last night. Having just gotten off the train from Manhattan this place is very convenient. The ambiance from the street and upon walking in is very charming and the overall aesthetic is lovely with the exposed brick walls and chalk boards. As it was late I wasn't expecting a full menu or the best service but we got both. Our waiter James was very personable and attentive the entire time. After deciding what we were going to eat we chose an appropriate bottle, a Borolo for $55 didn't seem crazy.  After James opened and poured our wine we received slices of bread that were still soft and chewy with a crisp crust. James explained that everything ( bread, pasta, deserts etc) is made on site. The bread was delicious, even at 9:30 PM. Our polpette were served delicious and warm. The sauce over the polpette was great. They should use it to make a spaghetti and meatball dish for the main menu. My wife ordered the Bolognese and I had the pappardelle with wild boar ragu. The Bolognese, while delicious, seemed more of a marinara to me. I didn't get any saffron or cream and there was very little meat. The flavor was fresh and clean, but it wasn't bolognese. My pappardelle were perfect. The ragu was perfectly seasoned and the pasta was thin and tender. Unfortunately we didn't have room for desert as I really wanted to try the salted caramel tart with bacon whip cream, but, alas, was too full. I am holding back one star until I return and have a repeat experience as good as this one. As of now I highly recommend giving it a try.

We dined at this lovely establishment last Friday and we shall be back!!!! Our server Kyle (female) whom we immediately recognized from another fine restaurant was just amazing. We started with a dozen oysters and some other apps that I can't remember. My wife had the fish special which she said was delicious and I had the squid ink pasta with seafood. Everything was very good and good portions. I can see where some would complain about the acoustics as those beautiful brick walls can certainly bounce your conversations around. You got 4 thumbs up from us and we'll be back!!!!!!!!!!
What an incredible experience.  While having a pre-dinner drink with our friends we learned our bartender was also co-owner. She was friendly and attentive and welcomed us warmly. The dining experience was even better. The food was INCREDIBLE!  Who knew duck wings could taste so good. I had the special fish which was perfectly done and the portion was big enough to allow me to bring the rest home for lunch the next day. I would have been happy with the evening right there and then but our friends insisted on dessert.  We shared the chocolate caramel sea salt tart (I think it had a slightly different name but that basically describes it.)  my husband who rarely eats dessert fought me over the last piece.  YUM! To top it off the wait staff was friendly and attentive and quite lovely.  We will definitely be back again soon as well as be telling everyone to head down to Poughkeepsie to try it out!
I'm jumping in to comment on a very negative review posted on 9/9/14.  My wife and I were at the table next to this reviewer and we were shocked to see the comments she posted.    Not only are most of her comments out of bounds and insulting to both the servers and owner, they are not at all accurate.  We witnessed the incredible show this woman put on while complaining about the cost of her glass of wine.    The owner was patient and polite while trying to reason with her but it was clear this was a person that could not be reasoned with.  The owner quickly agreed to remove the disputed charge from the bill but this woman kept on ranting and emphasizing she was on the faculty of Vassar - somehow thinking this would merit some special consideration. I urge all Yelpers to thoroughly discount her "review."  My wife and I are local foodies and this is clearly one of the stand out restaurants in the Hudson Valley.  The staff is knowledgeable and friendly, and the food is exceptional. The only remotely negative thing I can say about this local gem is that it is off the beaten path.  You are not likely to stumble on it accidentally but will have to make the effort to search it out - it is well worth it.   This is a fairly new establishment and will need positive word of mouth to gain the   success it deserves.  These owners and their staff do not deserve to be slandered by an unreasonable person.  Please disregard that review and give the Nic L a chance to serve you dinner.  You will not be disappointed.
Stopped in after a Sunday car ride to check it out and were very impressed with the layout, the menu, and the wine and beer selections.  We will definitely be back.
Had a so-so experience at this restaurant. Pros: Neat building and atmosphere, nice open design. The food was VERY good - everyone at the table ordered a different entree and everyone enjoyed their meal. Cons: I felt it was a bit too expensive, for this price there are better local restaurants to choose from. The wait for food was too long. I don't like to be rushed, but there is a point where you start to want your food - we waited over an hour after placing our order. One thing that also turned me off was the lack of bread! We had to wait 30 minutes for bread, and when it finally came the waitress placed one slice of bread on each of our plates and walked off. If I spend $250 on a meal I expect to have a basket of bread on my table at all times. We weren't offered more after our one slice, I had to flag down the waitress and ask her to bring more - and we each got one more slice lol. I would probably give the restaurant more time to straighten out some kinks before recommending a friend to eat there. Not when there are great options like the Mill House Brewery, Brasserie, and the Beech Tree Grill available.
Ate here last night with a dear friend and it is completely charming. We had a table by the french doors which were open and a perfect view of the walkway. It's so peaceful. Had a wonderful meal of tilefish over corn and wilted greens with a yummy creamy sauce. The wine was excellent. Agree with an earlier comment about the bread but the salted carmel chocolate tort was delicious! I will definitely be back! Love the way they do the chalk board specials.
Things started out bad with the rude hostess/owner.  If you can't at least pretend to be friendly, then you need to pay someone else to do it.  Waitress was also rude and appeared aggravated by any questions about the menu.   The food was good, especially the pasta dishes, but I can't get over the rudeness.  With so many other restaurants in the area competing for business, everything has to be on point, especially the service.
There are much better options in this area for this type of dining, I'd skip this one!           Here's why: It started out nicely, the restaurant does have a lovely atmosphere, a lounge/bar area and a small dining room. The lighting is dimly set and makes for a romantic atmosphere though it was so loud I did have trouble hearing at points, both my date and the waiter. They were running behind "because of the snow" so we were happy to start with a drink in the lounge, to be fair we had just gotten an epic 2' of snow, it was a believable excuse at first.       I ordered a beer, one of my favorites, my fiancé ordered a mixed drink, it was way too sweet, but sometimes that happens. We didn't have to wait too long, they sat us at a small two top along the wall.       The hostess, who we guessed was an owner, said she'd be right back to tell us about the menu. We were obviously forgotten about. Finally, as I was about to go track down a server, she saw me looking around and sent someone over who apologized for the wait and took our wine order, we went with a disappointing bottle of red, but that wasn't their fault.      We first ordered one of their charcuterie boards, it was now past 9, we were hungry. When the server returned to take the rest of the order, we selected the spinach salad and two (way over-priced) pasta dishes, their "farm to table" selection was fairly limited that night thus our decision to go with pasta. Then we waited, and waited, and waited. The charcuterie board took over 45 minutes to come out, it was literally 3 types of cheese and 4 types of meat (that the server struggled to name) with a small bowl of cold roasted vegetables and olives, not hard to make, obviously we were forgotten again. After we finished that and it was cleared, we were waiting for the salad, the server came to tell us they were out of the spinach salad. This was now over an hour after we had ordered it, I know that mistakes happen but they were starting to add up at our table and it was showing us just an overall lack of organization from the kitchen, to the servers to the hostess.     When I went in search of the restroom, I walked into the full bar area and found the hostess (owner?) with her mouth full of food on the floor, not super professional. So she couldn't answer me when I asked where the restroom was.     Ok, last thing and then I'll stop my b*tching! The pasta dishes came out in a timely manner, my fiancé's was actually fairly tasty, though still WAY over priced but mine was disgusting. I ordered the mushroom ravioli, the ravioli itself was good but it came in a lemon, truffle oil broth that was so gross. There was no mention of lemon in the description on the menu but it was completely overpowering, plus, the flavor battle that was going on with the truffle oil was just a terrible experience.      My fiancé doesn't like to make a scene or complain in restaurants and I'm now regretting that I didn't say something. We took home the inedibles and gave them to the dog. She didn't complain! I do have to give them credit for acknowledging their mistake and taking the charcuterie board off our bill but we still spent a lot for a very disappointing evening.
I really want to like Nic L Inn. There are things to love, and things that need a lot of work before I can really recommend it. I've been three or four times; once just for drinks/snacks in the lounge, and the other times for dinner. As most of the other reviewers have noted, the ambience and decor are clear wins. It's well thought out, urban chic, and definitely takes advantage of the historic elements of the building. (Exposed brick for the win!) The hostess, who I do believe is the owner, seems perpetually confused and/or distracted. The wait staff are pleasant and friendly, but lack the skill and knowledge I'd expect at this price point. If you're selling a charcuterie platter, you need to be able to pronounce the names of each item and describe it as well. If you're calling yourself a wine bar, every single member of the front-of-house staff needs to be able to pronounce the wines on your list. They also need to be able to flawlessly open a bottle! I'd skip most of the mixed drinks in favor of the wine-the bar is limited. The food is also delicious, if a bit pricey as some have noted. The pasta tastes fresh and is well dressed; the desserts are also delicious. I'll also say that the name is a bit odd; I know it's a tribute to the other restaurants owned by this family, but it's a weird spelling and hard to find online. I will probably give this place another try in a few months to see if the service quality has improved-I hope it will.
Starting off as a review of the craft beer, it's top notch. Maybe the best selection of 8 taps in the region.  Super focused on local breweries and showcases the best beer that the Hudson Valley has to offer.  I don't know anything about wine but have to assume with the level of detail spent on the beer, equal time if not more was spent on the wine selection. For dinner, I had a pasta entree off the regular menu with an appetizer from the specials.  Both were very tasty and I certainly would go back, especially for the beer. Oh and you have to get dessert... I swear to you, leave room for dessert! For visitors to Poughkeepsie, I would suggest walking the pedestrian only bridge across the river. It was pretty spectacular, especially now during the fall.
We dined at this lovely establishment last Friday and we shall be back!!!! Our server Kyle (female) whom we immediately recognized from another fine restaurant was just amazing. We started with a dozen oysters and some other apps that I can't remember. My wife had the fish special which she said was delicious and I had the squid ink pasta with seafood. Everything was very good and good portions. I can see where some would complain about the acoustics as those beautiful brick walls can certainly bounce your conversations around. You got 4 thumbs up from us and we'll be back!!!!!!!!!!
Very solid kitchen with focused but well prepared menu is complemented by value priced wine selections focusing more on price than Parker ratings. Fun spot. New "wine themed" dinners a good value ($65 prixe fixe w/ wine)  and gives the kitchen a chance to show off.
What an incredible experience.  While having a pre-dinner drink with our friends we learned our bartender was also co-owner. She was friendly and attentive and welcomed us warmly. The dining experience was even better. The food was INCREDIBLE!  Who knew duck wings could taste so good. I had the special fish which was perfectly done and the portion was big enough to allow me to bring the rest home for lunch the next day. I would have been happy with the evening right there and then but our friends insisted on dessert.  We shared the chocolate caramel sea salt tart (I think it had a slightly different name but that basically describes it.)  my husband who rarely eats dessert fought me over the last piece.  YUM! To top it off the wait staff was friendly and attentive and quite lovely.  We will definitely be back again soon as well as be telling everyone to head down to Poughkeepsie to try it out!
I tried. I tried again. It just got worse. Much worse. The Good: Beautiful, well thought out design. Atheistically impressive upon walking in the door. Nicely appointed touches--fresh flowers, candles, beautiful tabletops and linens. Warm and cozy. Friendly service. The Bad: Noisy. Not clean. Unpolished service (though friendly--explanations of dishes could not be articulated.) Curt hostess. No drink menu, confusing wine list that came with a long explanation from the hostess that we did not understand, limited bar drinks and VERY limited menu. The Ugly: INSANELY EXPENSIVE. If you are going to charge $26? for a carbonara, not only should it knock my socks off but it should be more than (literally) one cup of food. Really, just why that price for such a simple dish? It was fine. Just fine. When we got the bill, it was all rather shocking as we tend to not pay attention to the numbers when we decide we deserve a night out. Until the end, when it felt like the biggest gouge we've ever been stupid enough not to notice. Usually, we are only on guard to these types of gouging practices in tourist areas, where we look for the "off the beaten track" locals place. I just did not get it. Poughkeepsie is my hometown...does being 8 blocks up from the Hudson now constitute these prices? I should have been on alert when noticing the $39 steak. I would not recommend this place. I wanted to like it so badly, but the menu kind of reminds me of the things your mom would offer you to eat. Pasta. That's pretty much it. No appetizers, a few salads, and lots of pasta for lots of money. No thank you, I can do that at home. (Can you tell this place has irked me?)
Stopped in after a Sunday car ride to check it out and were very impressed with the layout, the menu, and the wine and beer selections.  We will definitely be back.
