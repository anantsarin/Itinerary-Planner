Great local record store. Considering how small this town is, it's amazing that we have a records store of this caliber. Every time I'm in the staff seems friendly and knowledgable. Wonderful place to lose a few hours and find some vinyl.
The Bestest record store I have ever been too, selection is delish...  Prices are extra reasonable, George and company are some of the nicest fellas you'll come accross in the commons too, so go gorge on in and swim in the lush river of sound opportunities :-)             -kb
Angry mom is the premiere location to find anything from The Beatles to Daft Punk to the most obscure indie records, at a reasonable price in decent to excellent condition.
i love this place. i first came here in march of 2009 and would make the trip up at least a few times a year and spend between $75 and $120. at one point they even gave me a free shirt because of how much i spent, and they always have free stickers. i'm mostly into punk, but i like blues and country as well and look through those sections when i'm there. i've found country records there for cheaper than i thought they should be, but the blues records are a fair price and as for the punk, they have a great selection, they have records that i didn't even know existed, awesome bootlegs of old 80's hardcore bands, i have no idea where they get them. so for punk, they can be a little overpriced, BUT they know that people are willing to pay what they want for them. they are also great to work with when you want to sell your own records. a couple years ago i brought in a bunch of records and they gave me $100 for them, which i thought was more than fair. the owner and staff are always pretty laid back and willing to help out if you need something. great place worth visiting, even just to see the old 80's hardcore punk fliers that line the walls!
I moved last summer, and aside from my friends, Angry Mom is what I miss the most about Ithaca. They've ruined me for other record stores--great prices, well-organized inventory, and a knowledgeable, friendly staff. There's a record-sized hole in my heart now that used to be filled by afternoons browsing the stacks. This will be one of my first stops anytime I'm back in town.
Not the easiset place to find but so worth your effort.   Superb selection, reasonably priced, great help.  I came out of there with 11 albums under $50.00.  What a wonderful way to spend a couple of hours flipping through old vinyl.   If you don't see it - ask.  I get to Ithaca a couple of times a year.  It's a' not miss' adventure everytime I go!
BEST REKKID STORE I'VE EVER BEEN TO IN MY LIFE. (I need to say it that strongly, in all caps, because my partner and I dropped $350+ there over the course of a few days! We have both been all over the west visiting the supposed meccas for obscure vinyl in Amoebas and Rasputins across CA, record shops in AZ, and small specialty record shops in Seattle and PDX.... and have never walked out with such a massive haul of amazing gems, and at the fairest prices!) About the shop, Angry Mom is set up in the basement/lower level of the Autumn Leaves bookstore with nice organized shelves of vinyl that spans an impressive amount of genres, with a great new arrivals section too for the frequent buyer! Listening Stations, he has2 of those (!!!) so it is even easier to try some random records out and get into some new music!!! Amazing fliers from early hardcore and punk shows line some of the walls, along with a display case that holds some great books. There's also an awesome display out front of record players for sale too. I hate hate hate digging for records at thrift stores and flea markets because I know there wont be any Black Flag, DRI, or Siouxsie lurking in overpriced dingy stacks- the owner George has done all that work and collected the most amazing assortment of the basic record store rock/jazz/country staples with the best selection of punk, metal, and gothy post punk stuff I've ever seen, all that are priced between $8 -$10 and awesome basics like Abba's Greatest Hits was $2.50, Duran Duran $3, etc Here's a partial list of the amazing rare all Original no represses rekkids I swooped in on for length defying yelp review excess (2) Smiths albums $14/$15 each (1)Gang of Four album $18.50 (2) Cure albums $12/$10 (3) Depeche Mode albums $8/$10 (1) Bauhaus bbc sessions $15 and awesome anarcho punk Conflict, Crass, Flux of Pink Indians for $10/$12 (3) PIL albums $6/$10 and an assortment of great metal mostly $8 each and rarities like King Diamond for $15 YAYYYYYYY!!
This is truly a wonderful record store. The owner has achieved a rare balance of depth and pricing. Most record stores these days are either CD stores that offer some common titles on vinyl at cheap prices or "collector" stores that charge a premium for everything. Angry Mom fits nicely in the middle - it has plenty of obscure and collectible albums for very reasonable prices, thousands of really cheap used records, and some new vinyl as well. Obscure example: "Hudson Rock" compilation - $5 ; collectible example: "Captain Beyond" with 3D cover - $18 (vs. $30-50 online). Great selection, great prices, great location - worth a trip!
Happened to be in town on business and had read reviews about this shop beforehand. My expectations were exceeded in nearly ever possible way. First off, the jazz section is huge, incredibly organized and reasonably priced with plenty of obscure gems to be had particularly in the free jazz genre. Their recent bin was a playground of everything from folk to weirdo stuff, and that is where I had to stop because I simply ran out of time. I could spend a weekend in that place. Like others said they have nice listening stations, really well setup and the staff was super nice and easy to talk with. A rarity, on both counts, in most shops these days. This is worth going out of your way to visit, you will not be sorry.
Being a hardcore vinyl guy that's always willing to spend a huge chunk of change, I feel that the greatest complement I can give a record store is COMING BACK A SECOND TIME.  Some stores just suck (you know what I mean). ANGRY MOM is a pretty decent store.  Great?  The best ever?  No.  But I do find myself coming back here at least once a year.  Selection is always good.  Prices are good on most things.  Yeah, some stuff is a bit on the high end, but no harm done. I always end up finding roughly 30 or 40 pieces during my annual visit.  Average price hovers around 8 bucks.  Some stuff is as cheap as 3 dollars, and I've forked over I think as much as 40 dollars for an album.  But that's the exception, not the rule.   Listening stations always work (which is a plus).  And they don't give you those "hey, don't touch the merchandise" stares.  So a pleasant shopping experience too.
Yes. Angry Mom is that good. Despite looking relatively small, this place has a great selection of used records. I was only in there for less than 30 minutes and found two records that I've been looking for or meaning to buy. They were both decently priced and in great condition. Neil Young's American Stars & Bars for $5? Yes please!
One of the best record stores I've been too, in Ithaca or anywhere. Emphasis on used vinyl, with an awesome selection spanning an array of genres from punk to jazz to comedy/old novelty records (the hip hop selection is slim to nonexistent, though that unfortunately seems to be the case with most vinyl shops that don't have a specific hip hop focus). I've experienced a number of used record epiphanies here, usually at awesome prices. I'll vouch for it over any Manhattan record store I've been to.

This record store is insanely awesome. I only spent about 20 minutes here for my first visit, but that was enough to run around like a kid in a candy store finding all kinds of great records. Most of the ones I wanted were like $2.50. That's just crazy. There are some that are more expensive (plus they have "new" titles), but for the most part you can walk out with a giant stack of records for less than $50. Genres: Jazz, rock, blues, punk, soundtracks, all kinds of stuff. If you're looking for classical records, you will be a bit disappointed. They have some crates of records, but they don't seem to be organized or to be very diverse. It seemed like half the titles were either Shostakovich or Bach. I couldn't find any Chopin, which is what I was after. But, if you're looking for any other genre, you will be amazed and pleased.

I have to say, I was a bit blown away by this little find, located in the lower level of the used bookstore in the Commons. I wandered downstairs after having bought a couple of books and was truly amazed at the quality of records this small record store had.  All four early Peter Gabriel solo records worth a damn - really?  A shit-ton of 45s that I had no time to search through like I wanted - I think I could have been in there for another hour, easily. This little record store has it all for me - quality rather than quantity, except for the wall of 45s I mentioned, which was a truly full collection of soul, r&b, pop and rock from the 60s and 70s.  Nice jazz selection as well - I wanted the Ornette Coleman Free Jazz album but didn't have enough cash on hand. Next time I'm in Ithaca I'm going to visit my Angry Mom and dig through those 45s.

It's incredible that a record store this good exists in Ithaca, NY! Their punk and independent selection is awesomely curated , many niche musical interests can be found here and they always keep in stock the classic hits. The prices are also A+! They also really support local, DIY music and host many touring bands and local shows for free or cheap in the back of the store. The people who work here are incredibly thoughtful about the organization and selection, take great care of their records, are encyclopedias of music knowledge and are awesome folks who you feel good supporting. They're also usually playing really good stuff in the store while you shop. It's a destination for any collector or general music-lover traveling from out of town. You would expect to find a store this good in a bigger city!

The reviews for this place seemed too good to be true. Angry Mom is incredible! Huge, well-curated selection, friendly staff...just wow. A must-stop!
