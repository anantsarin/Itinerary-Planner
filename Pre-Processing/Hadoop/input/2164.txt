Absolute favorite restaurant ever. Ive been going here ever since I can remember. Whenever I come home from DC I always make sure to come here. Food is amazing (especially the prime rib and scallops). I love how far out in the country it is. No cell phone service, so no annoying customers on their phones. I could probably count on one hand the amount of times I've bad "bad" service, but it wasn't even that bad. Make sure to have a reservation. There have been plenty of times my family and I have gone out there thinking there wouldn't be anyone and we couldn't get in. Inside the main dining room, there is a nice fireplace, which is very cozy in the winter. There's a snowmobile trail behind the restaurant, so sometimes in the winter you'll see snowmobiles. The outdoor bar in the summer is also great. It's a very chill vibe. Cute bar, a little fountain with fish (I think?), lots of bird feeders (hummingbird and regular bird feeders), I'm not sure what more you could want from a county restaurant?
f you're a lover of remote out of the way hidden gem restaurants like me, you're going to love Nic-L-Inn. Though the address says Frewsburg, trust me, it's nowhere near Frewsburg. It's way out on Bone Run Road in a lovely setting which is actually located closer to the Seneca Nation's Indian Reservation than it is to Frewsburg; so how much more remote can you get than that? Which, by the way is one of the reasons you won't see any Yelp Check-ins here since it is located way out of cell phone range. The restaurant itself is not only clean but of absolutely outstanding décor finely decorated with all forms of trophy deer, fish squirrel and other area wildlife. The deep wood paneling, stone work and particularly its all cherry wood bar give an ambiance of local flavor and taste unequaled by any other area restaurant. The owners are always present and their staff friendly polite and warm. As for food, they're really very good and always willing to make any custom adjustments to suit the desires of their customers. They not only have an extensive menu but if you look at the board, there are generally four or five daily specials displayed. My favorites are their clams casino, their steaks and their prime rib. Nic-L-Inn also provides a perfect outdoor bar as well as dining area which is open in the summer. I always enjoy being there, eating at the bar or at the inside lounge area looking the fountain, watching the hummingbirds feeding at their feeders, some ducks or whatever other wildlife might happen by. For setting and décor, the place is a five star plus and for food far better than what is otherwise available in the area. Overall, I'd say it is a must visit place.

We had a wonderful meal there last night.  My wife and I enjoyed the Prime Rib which was cooked perfectly.  It is a long drive to get there, but well worth the adventure.

Five years ago I would've given the Nik-L Inn 4 stars.  I would alternate between Chicken Parmesan and Filet Mignon.  The filet was always thick, lean and cooked to perfection (medium rare for me).  But something happened with the quality of their food.  Our last meal was my birthday last August.  My filet was thin and fatty, a poor cut of meat.  My husband ordered a stuffed fish, the stuffing was super salty and mushy, and the fish was dry and tasteless.   This used to be my husband's favorite place to eat, but since our last experience, I won't ever go back.  There are too many other good places that are closer to home.  Very disappointing.

I've been eating here on just about every trip up to visit my relatives in the local area, so that makes about 25 years where I can actually be a sort-of mature food critic.  The Nic-L-Inn is easily the best sit-down restaurant in the area, with an extensive menu of great food. The prime rib is king here -- but come hungry.  Even the queen cut is 14-16 ounces, but always seems to come out a little on the big side.  It's always just perfectly cooked, too -- ask for medium rare, get medium rare.  And for those used to city prices on things, 19 bucks for a gi-normous prime rib with all the fixins is a steal. The ambiance is wonderful, too -- if you can get a window seat, there are swarms of hummingbirds around the restaurant.  There are plenty of tables, but it doesn't feel crowded.  There is outdoor seating, too, which has a great tiki-bar feel to it. Service is always great, especially when your cousin's kids work there.

Can't put my finger on the reason(s), but the food at the Nic-l-Inn seems to flucuate with each visit.  When I first ate there 20 years ago the food was four to five stars.  The prime rib was world-class at a small town price.  My wife praised the lasagna as being as good as any she'd had in Little Italy in Baltimore.   My last visit (last summer) showed the food to be pedestrian and the prices no longer small town.  The expansions and the addition of the clam bar are nice, but I'd rather have the old food back.  Nick and Linda are still salt-of-the-earth folks with a desire to please each and every diner.  That makes the drop in quality even more puzzling.  Maybe it's me that changed and not the Nic-L-Inn.

Amy and I stopped here at the Nic-L-Inn for a nice dinner.  We hadn't made reservations but it seemed like we were expected to, altho we were seated immediately.  Amy ordered the lasagna and I ordered the prime rib.  The prime rib was nice and rare as I ordered it.  It was ok, not bad but not the best I've had.  Amy's lasagna was kind of bland and the garlic toast was dry and stale. The drinks and desert were good and fyi there's no cell service in that area...
