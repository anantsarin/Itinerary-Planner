While ordering over the phone was a bit difficult (there's no menu to be found online so I went by the woman on the phone's suggestions), and getting my food to the correct spot was a challenge (though he's certainly not the first reliever guy to get lost), the food was fabulous. The chimichanga was HUGE, I could barely finish a third of it, and the floutas (sp?) were yummy. As a plus, the salads came with the regular salad toppings (tomatoes, cucumbers, carrots, etc.) but also with nicely ripe avocado on top. The beans (brown) and orange rice was delicious, especially because I am not usually a fan of either. While I am obviously no expert of Mexican cuisine, I know good food when I have it -- and this was certainly one of those times. I will be definitely returning for dinner here again.

I am guardedly optimistic about this place. Having driven by many times, I have remained curious regarding the quality of the food here. While a few places on Main Street are grittily authentic, I find a lot of the Mexican food in Poughkeepsie to be middling in quality. So, I stopped in here and was initially wary...but there was a Mexican-American family, all women of several generations, finishing up their dinner when I walked in. A good sign. The young woman at the counter was helpful, and I ordered Camarones en Ajo--shrimp in garlic sauce. The 'specials' board included some authentic dishes, like Barbacoa d'Chivo (barbecued goat), but I wasn't ready to make the leap--not on my first visit. So, when my food came out from the kitchen, it was a woman bringing it out. She had a motherly look, and when I thanked her, she gave me a warm smile. I headed home, and my car was heady with the aromas of garlic and shrimp. I got home and found a lovely dinner in the containers. The shrimp were cooked perfectly in a not-too-rich garlicky cream sauce, and the yellow rice (with peas) was tasty. There were some homemade flour tortillas and a fresh salad. This is where I have to give them a lot of credit. The salad was mostly Iceberg lettuce, but it was very fresh and chilled. But there were also pieces of radish, carrot, onion and avocado (!), with a piece of lime to squeeze onto the seasoned salad. Am I convinced? No. Am I intrigued? Definitely, and I plan to try this place again soon.

Wow. I don't know where these 5 star reviews are from, but clearly they must've visited a restaurant on a different planet than the one I've been to. Incredibly mediocre Mexican fare. Mole Mole is better by leaps and bounds; for "hole in the wall" Potown Mexican, El Charrito has it beat by miles. Where to begin? Flavorless sopes. Refried beans that have either come out of a can or been refried 14,000 times. Margaritas from a mix. Ugh. Maybe one step up from T Bell, but at least T Bell infuses some flavor into their food! And, to boot: not at all friendly towards the gringos. I have been to Mexico, attempted to "go native," and when pressed into service can use enough Spanish to order a meal. Even though I am 6' white dude with swoopy bangs, I always felt welcome in hole in the wall Mexican joints in the middle of the Yucatan...not so much at La Fonda here in good old Potown!

This restaurant is literally right off the rail trail on the Poughkeepsie side of the bridge. You can park your bikes and lock them to the picnic tables outside. They are clearly visible from every seat in the house. Once inside you will wait a little while for your meal since everything is made from scratch. There is a little old grandma in back who makes the food. What you get is seriously authentic Mexican. Really. It's where the locals eat and, since the rail trail just pushed through, nobody has discovered it yet. Large portions, alcohol and just very very good food.

Took a chance on this place for lunch and man am I glad I did! I got 3 tacos plus rice and beans for just $8. The food quality is excellent, I would especially recommend the chorizo taco which had a perfect sear on really good quality chorizo. They also give you chips and 3 sauces, each of which is delicious with both chips and the tacos. They even have a great tequila bar and are one of the few places in the area to serve a margarita with an inverted beer bottle in it. Definitely looking forward to my next visit!

breath of fresh air on that part of the city, just close to the walk way on Parker avenue lies this authentic Mexican restaurant. The food is refreshing especially the tortillas are homemade and just makes up for the meals....my favorite is the "La Fonda special" which is just amazing. You will not be dissapointed with the place, the owner is amazing too!!
