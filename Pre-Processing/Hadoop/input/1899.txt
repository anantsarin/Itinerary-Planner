Dear Sir/ To who it may concern, My wife Kathy and I had dinner at your facility August 21,2014 and were disappointed in three aspects of the experience:1) the appetizers were bland,she had the tuna appetizer and I had the lobster. The lobster was cold and her tuna could not be tasted. The entrees she had the beef and I had the duck. The duck was good. Her beef tasted mealy and almost moldy. The table next to us also had the truffle soup which nauseated my wife. The dessert i had was so loaded with sugar and artificial flavoring I sent it back (modern lemon bar) and had it replaced with the cheese board which was merely sufficient. Our server also neglected to give us silverware to the eat our desserts for 15 minutes after she dropped them off to us. We went to the apple pie bakery today Friday (8/22/14) morning looking for breakfast... Too bad for me my wife loved her salted caramel coconut donut and stated it was the best thing she had at CIA. I had the pretzel with broccoli and cheese which was delivered cold! I sent it back and was given a new one warmed and then had an upset stomach all day. In all good conscience we really cannot think of going back to the american harvest restaurant tonight. It was also irksome to notice that your comment site is closed and not accepting any messages.  A restaurant lives on its status and knowledge. Yours is giving the wrong message! Especially after a two week vacation the restaurant should've been on top of the world! It was also very noisy! Friday evening-8 p.m.Cancelled American Bounty. That open table responded to after I made a phone call and went through a telephone loop of two Number touches and a #. How prophetic I visited The Bounty yesterday and was told by a man having a better permanent than many women I've met that he was sorry he had no openings for last night. I replied that it was okay because we'd already made reservations there and depending on how the food went at the French restaurant depended on whether we'd show there tomorrow. He replied that they had better be good. They weren't!!! c'est dommage (it's a pity).ours truly Alex glatt.
Wow, what an amazing restaurant. I will start on the location and decor.  This restaurant is located in the CIA and the scenery is beautiful.  It is a large beautiful campus with flowers and trees and a large water fountain. You can spend time at the gift shop and bakery before or after your meal.  The bakery has really pretty desserts.  You can check out my review for the bakery in a future review. All the food was fantastic.  The presentation was beautiful and the flavor was spot on.  My party of 5 all opted for the three course prix fixed menu.  They have many options to choose from: Appetizers: Black Truffle Soup - Very strong truffle taste and very creamy Torchon of Foie Gras - The plating is beautiful, but the bread that came with it for spreading was VERY OILY, so I was not able to enjoy the foie gras Butter-Poached Lobster - ONE OF THE BEST poached lobster I have had and also one of the best dished at this restaurant Entres: Roasted Rack of Lamb - This was a little gamey for me, but the two that order this as their entrees love it.  The flavor was good and it was very tender Beef Strip Loin - Good flavor, and also very tender Scallops - OMG MELT IN YOUR MOUTH BUTTER.  AMAZING!!! Also has this weird pea puree which was funky but cool. Dessert:  I didn't feel that any one of the desserts were extra special.  They were all just okay.  THEY LOOK GREAT THO. Vanilla Bean Pot de Crème - The thing I loved best about this is the caramel sauce which was more like a pudding and the black sesame halva that was amazing, everything else on this plate was blah Modernist Lemon Bar - The cake was okay, normal, the coconut ice cream mixed with the cake was a little better Table-Side Ice Cream & Classic Treats - This was really cool.  They make the ice cream in front of you.  It is lavender ice cream with a fruity, floral flavor. The treats were okay I will come back for the butter poaches lobster and the scallops.  For dessert, just the caramel sauce with the sesame shavings
The food was simply fantastic. All the food was beautifully presented on their plates. Our starters were fresh and tasty, the entrees were delicious and excellently prepared. The prix fixe menu was a perfect choice for us. As good as the food was, I was delighted at the wonderful attention to service. We mentioned only to the hostess seating us that we were getting married in a few days. She passed that on to our waiter who congratulated us, then the instructor on the floor came over to congratulate us, and finally we got "Congratulations" written in chocolate on both of our dessert plates! And we're a same-sex couple too. It made us feel very special. Wonderful food and exceptional service. We look forward to returning one day.
We had the midweek prix fixe for $45 each -- a fantastic value. The flavors in each dish were surprising, mysterious, artfully combined. If you are looking for something absolutely familiar, forget it. Keep an open mind. My duck was recognizably duck and my wife's tenderloin was recognizably steak, but the accompanying flavors were unusual. I had the tuna, which others have not liked, and thought it was excellent. YMMV. I passed on the desserts and had the cheese plate, which was an excellent end to the meal but I thought overpriced for what it was -- six small slices of cheese. You can simplify the immense wine list by going to their recommendation. Some are modestly priced (for a restaurant) and excellent value. The Greystone label (after the Napa CIA) denotes California blends that are delicious -- I went home  and ordered a mixed case of the sauvignon blanc and cabernet sauvignon. The service was friendly and helpful, though not completely ready for prime time. I'm giving a top rating for value and overall experience.
Let me preface this review by saying that I have been to American Bounty twice and they are a 4 star and sometimes 5 star restaurant. I went to Bocuse with high hopes and was sorely disappointed. To start the bread they serve tasted really hard and old.  I know French bread is supposed to be 'crusty' but this was not the case. Our waitress was not knowledgable on any aspect of the menu. Recommendations, questions, she really had no idea. I ended up getting the Tuna appetizer which was a cold soup, which I didn't like, the waitress didn't bother to mention this. My appetizer was served while I was in the restroom. They do not hold the chair out for the lady when seating the table and do not fold the napkin if you leave the table. Every French restaurant does this. The beef tenderloin was well made but the side sauce it was plated on was REALLY salty. It was a soy sauce type glaze that didn't go well at all. The crab appetizer was lackluster as well. We each ordered a glass of wine and though they were poured in a mini decanter they were not the same portion. The wine list is given on an iPad which is a little weird for a French restaurant. We were asked if we wanted to see the dessert menu and decided to give it a try. Once gain the waitress had no clue on what to recommend, we asked about dessert wines and she had no idea. We decided to just cancel it as at that point we were just fed up. To top it off as we were walking out we asked for a comment card. The hostess mumbled something about the iPad being out and how the professor had the cards. I told her i'd wait and she hands me a yellow post-it pad.  You are a university and are expecting people to pay $100+ for lunch, your service and food quality should reflect this. They also add 17% mandatory gratuity which is not a gratuity as the servers are not allowed to accept (due to IRS regulations) this but it goes to the school. Not worth the money. This restaurant has a long way to go to be on par with American Bounty. I left my name and phone number with my comment. Let's see if they have to courtesy to follow up.
Had such an excellent dinner It really was a fun experience. Was lucky enough to sit right next to the kitchen, and we had a great time watching the action. Our meals were perfectly prepared, and the dishes were so well conceived. Our waiters were oh-so-very polite and attentive, and it was great to hear about their approaching graduation date and future plans. Our dessert order got a bit confused and took a while, but everyone was so lovely and enthusiastic, that we couldn't have cared less (in the end we got three desserts, hard to complain!). Thank you for such a wonderful evening!

We are periodic guests at the CIA restaurants, at least twice a year, and I am a Boot Camp participant.  We made our annual wedding anniversary visit to the CIA, this year choosing Bocuse.   I guess the loud din that greeted us upon entering Roth Hall should have been a warning; Bocuse has none of the ambiance or intimacy of Escoffier,  the previous incarnation of the space.  What had been two separate rooms is now one.  The noise level is quite high, which would not have bothered me in my Boot Camp experience, but was out of place for an anniversary or "date night". The service was attentive, but not smothering.  We always enjoy the student experience, one of the reasons we always return. The food was really just OK.  Up front, we requested gluten free options when making the reservation.  We were given a gluten free roll during bread service; it was the stereotype gluten free product, heavy, bland, and blah. My wife's guinea hen dish was very good.  It was hot, seasoned well, and was a good serving size.  I had the rack of lamb; lukewarm, under-seasoned, and a tiny portion size when the upcharge to the price-fix  menu is factored in. Desserts were fine, but an item that was not gluten free made its way to the plates, creating "issues" the next day. We will be back to the CIA, but will make the American Bounty our destination of choice in the future.

Considered to be the flagship restaurant of of the Culinary Institute.of America. Formerly known as Escoffier, Bocuse is the remodeled and and updated tribute to French cuisine, and culinary technique. In addition to being a high end restaurant serving modern French cuisine, and being most talked and hyped restaurant at the CIA, Bocuse holds a special place for students. For those that do not know, at the CIA  classes run on a three week cycle or flight system, So because the restaurant are student run every three weeks its as though the restaurant is hiring a whole new staff. While there is a learning curve at first, because this is typically the last class before graduation for many students is seen as the light at the end of the tunnel and you can truly see the passion, joy and determination in the students. When one first walks into Bocuse it surely holds up to everything that its supposed to. From the opening of the glass doors with the Bocuse insignia, to being greeted by the Maitre'D and seated as one admires the decor and atmosphere.Then as one gets settled in, with a choice of bread and the daily amuse bouche. just peaking into the kitchen as one looks at the menu the atmosphere among everything else sets the rest of the ngh in motion. While most students are very comfortable cooking in the back of the house its not always the case for front of the house. However while the service may not be perfect the food is absolutely outstanding despite an always changing menu,.Whether its the rich and tender poached lobster, the light and delicate crab or the fantastic pork belly any appetizer will surely  start things off right. Yet it doesn't stop there, the succulent braised rabbit. or perfectly cooked poached scallops, even the But of course one can't forget about dessert. While the dessert here isn't as amazing as amazing as the appetizers mates, tor entrees both the warm chocolate cake and lemon bar are delicious. Although Bocuse is definitely more expensive than most restaurants, opting for the prix-fix will definitely save you significantly. Bocuse is many things named after a world renowned chef, a special place for students and one outstanding restaurant. With an always changing menu, gorgeous presentation, despite being a bit pricey, as well as small portions, and often hard to get into it is well worth it A huge thank you and congrats to my fellow classmates, the class of June 13, 2014

Well worth the day trip from Manhattan. Pure culinary mastery without any of the snobbery associated with fine dining, The Bocuse takes French cuisine and makes it modern. The staff (who happen to be students at the Culinary Institute) provide excellent service and are happy to explain how dishes are made. The Bocuse also accommodates gluten allergies very well, providing gluten-free bread (a very rare commodity at restaurants, even in New York). Everything from the chicken fricassee to the homemade lavender ice cream was innovative and artfully created. Simply put, lunch at The Bocuse one of the best meals I've ever had.

I had a very enjoyable and unique experience here. I highly recommend doing the public tour of the Culinary Institute of America (CIA) before coming for lunch or dinner.  (The general public can schedule tours Monday-Friday at 4 p.m. when classes are in session or on Mondays at 10 a.m. The tours are $6 per person and reservations are required - See more at: ciachef.edu/ny-campus-to…) My friend and I did the tour on a Friday at 4pm and then had dinner at Bocuse at 6pm. Our wonderful tour guide explained to us that all of the servers and the chefs are students. They ran a very impressive kitchen. I was amazed at how poised and competent everyone was given their relative youth. For appetizers, we split the Dungeness crab and for entrees we got the venison and the lamb. Everything was really good and the presentation was beautiful. I especially enjoyed the flavors and presentation of the crab. The colors were so intense and it was almost too pretty to eat. I said almost! For dessert, we got the "Table Side Ice Cream & Classic Treats," which came with homemade ice cream, date cake and a braised pineapple and salted butter crumple. Our waitress came and made the ice cream in front of us. All in all, it was a 5-star experience and I highly recommend a visit!
I was here for a special event and did not have the standard menu, so a review of my meal wouldn't be helpful. But there are two things I want to tell you. 1. About the parking. CIA is HUGE and signage is not the greatest. You will enter from Route 9 and will see comforting signs that say "Restaurants" and "Restaurant Parking" but after awhile the parking signs disappear! There remains an arrow that says "Visitor Parking" and that's what you should follow. You want to go around to the opposite side of the huge Gothic building that greets you at the entrance (Roth Hall, which is incidentally a former Jesuit monastery) and park in a multi story semi-underground parking structure. From there it's easy to get to the Roth Hall rear entrance where the restaurants are. 2. Save room for dessert! They do an amazing job both on technique and on presentation. I am not a dessert guy but am glad I did not let this pass me by. Currently they are experimenting with ice cream made table side using a converted Kitchenaid mixer (to avoid trailing a cord, they installed a hand crank) and liquid nitrogen.

My husband and I went to Bocuse because it was featured on 36 hours in the New York Times. We were greeted warmly when we walked in, but after we were seated, we hardly ever saw our server. I got one glass of wine and wanted another, but I was never asked. We had to wait 30 min between the appetizer and main course when others who were seated after us were served. The foie gras was horribly disappointing. The bread it was served with was FRIED. What??? Who needs more fat with foie gras? French people don't fry much outside of pommes dauphines. Moving on to the main course, the steak and fish were good. Also, the cheese selection was yummy!! Warning: the coffee and liquor drinks are spiked to high heaven.

A wonderful restaurant. Staff were courteous pole and precise.  The food was incredible. Such a wonderful experience. We had foie gras, pintard, lamb and for desert, a fantastic cheese plate and chocolate flour less cake. All of it was incredible, and for the calibre of the food, the price is a bargain.

It's always fun to have culinary arts students doing the preparation and serving in a school's restaurant.  At the Culinary Institute of America, in a restaurant named Bocuse, it's even a higher standard.  And they do great. We had awesome food from a full menu.  The menu changes often, so I won't go into details.  I'll just say it was a terrific meal, because of both the food and the décor.  Everything was exceptionally well done.  It's worth the visit, as a unique restaurant offering delicious combinations of traditional foods.
Fantastic everything.  These culinary students gifted us with better service than at most fine dining restaurants. Just as wonderful of a gift was the delicious food. My party of four made sure to share and my favorites from the night are the monkfish, octopus, crab appetizer, and guinea hen (the sauce was outstandingly rich, left me constantly smacking my lips). This is a great place for a night out paired with a walk around the main building. Everything is beautiful especially in the Fall, and make sure to take in the view of the Hudson River.

We came here on a Saturday afternoon with another couple for lunch. It's approximately a 2-hour drive from NYC and we came here just for the food, so our expectations were quite high for this place. The setting is gorgeous, as you enter there is a huge wall of different wines in a glass showcase. The dining room itself is large, bustling and bright. The setting reminded me of Jean-Georges Restaurant in Central Park West. I had called in ahead to let them know that I was vegan and gluten free, so that they could accommodate for my dietary constraints (it is after all a French restaurant). They were quite understanding about it and said they would put together something for me. After we were seated, we asked for the wine / cocktail listed and they handed us a Ipad. They have an extensive wine list - which you can sort by type, region etc on the Ipad. How convenient and cool! Me and my friend ordered a glass of the Riesling, my boyfriend ordered a glass of the Montepulciano and my friend's boyfriend ordered a frostbite. My Riesling was really good - floral, hint of sweetness and so light and fresh. I liked my boyfriend's Montepulciano as well. I am typically not a huge red wine drinker - but I really liked this one, it was full bodied, not too dry and had a distinct oakiness to it. Last but by far not the least, a word about frostbite - its a tequila cocktail which is made with a serrano pepper infused tequila. It was absolutely delicious! It was a perfectly balanced cool drink, with a very muted heat coming from the serrano and the sweetness and citrus coming from the sugar and lime. It was so good! I am quite picky about cocktails - I don't like them too strong and if they are too watered down or sweet then they taste like juice. This was perfectly balanced. For our appetizers, my friend and I are vegetarian, so we ordered the black kale and arugula salad and sides of Ratatouille Niçoise and grilled leeks. Our boyfriends ordered the dungeness crab to share. Prior to our appetizers being served - they served us amouse bouche - the vegetarian version was a bite size of Caesar salad and a seafood one for the boys. Also, they brought out bread - I was really delighted to see that they could accommodate for gluten free bread for me! The appetizers I thought were really good especially the salad, it was light and tangy. The kale was shredded which made for a even better salad (I am going to try this technique at home). It also came with root vegetable chips which added crunchiness to the dish. The sherry vinaigrette really added a brightness to the salad. For the main course, unfortunately there are not a ton of options for vegetarians. For me they said they could make the warm quinoa and farro salad without the farro (and instead I asked for mushrooms to be added the dish). The presentation while lovely, the dish itself fell short in terms of flavor. It lacked seasoning and the dish itself felt a little bland. The dish comes with a carrot - lemongrass puree, which added sweetness. But it definitely needed some citrus flavors. Overall, I liked the appetizer much better than the entree. That being said, I do understand that this is a French restaurant and as such the vegetarian options are limited. My boyfriend ordered the venison for the entree and my friend's boyfriend ordered the lamb duo. My boyfriend found the venison a little overcooked (he ordered medium rare) and dry. The sauce moscovite served with the venison he found quite delicious - it was a french sauce made with venison stock, currants and wine. I was too full to order dessert. The two boys ordered the nutella hot chocolate and my friend ordered french press coffee. I tasted the coffee and it was quite good and smooth. They also served complimentary truffles and nougat at the end. Overall, I had a great experience here. The service here was so good! Really such a good surprise after you have been served in NYC (even at some of the best restaurants). Our initial waiter George wasn't sure about a lot of the questions that we asked him - but he never got frustated. Instead, he went and asked someone else. For next time, I would recommend coming here in the summer or at least when the weather is decent outside, when you can do other activities around the area and make a day trip out of it.

We attended August 22, 2014.  The lunch service was overstaffed on the floor providing the wait staff ample opportunity to basically stalk your table waiting for you to be finished; at that point the plates are wisked out from under you and onto your next course. The staff pushing the ice cream cart (lovely idea) smashed into a pillar while pushing it through the dining area which was loud. Our meals were not all that we would have expected, the chicken leg confit was way too salty, the Barbajuan resembled a taquito more than a pastry.  The drink order which was the 'house special' did not come out as stated on the menu. To sum it up, the excessive watching and removal of items from the table was the worse part and something to be ready for.
A wonderful restaurant. Staff were courteous pole and precise.  The food was incredible. Such a wonderful experience. We had foie gras, pintard, lamb and for desert, a fantastic cheese plate and chocolate flour less cake. All of it was incredible, and for the calibre of the food, the price is a bargain.
I am not exactly sure why every Other review was raving about this restaurant. The food was ok. Not worth the Price even in the least bit. And the service was ok. But off a note. We were never asked if we wanted anything to drink. Never was brought over a wine list. The braised beef was extremely salty. And when I brought this up to the waiter he went and talked to the chef and they explained that's how it's supposed to be. Which made no sense to Me. Salty is salty no way around it. It's a good experience but overall over priced
It's always fun to have culinary arts students doing the preparation and serving in a school's restaurant.  At the Culinary Institute of America, in a restaurant named Bocuse, it's even a higher standard.  And they do great. We had awesome food from a full menu.  The menu changes often, so I won't go into details.  I'll just say it was a terrific meal, because of both the food and the décor.  Everything was exceptionally well done.  It's worth the visit, as a unique restaurant offering delicious combinations of traditional foods.
The restaurant is quite modern and is very lively. Considered that our reservation time for dinner was 8PM which was late on a weekday in Dutchess County, the Bocuse was still lively and the staffs were everywhere. We had thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience at the Bocuse. The staffs were friendly and very informative. The dishes were well prepared and the presentation was gorgeous. It was certainly a treat to dine at The Bocuse.
Fantastic everything.  These culinary students gifted us with better service than at most fine dining restaurants. Just as wonderful of a gift was the delicious food. My party of four made sure to share and my favorites from the night are the monkfish, octopus, crab appetizer, and guinea hen (the sauce was outstandingly rich, left me constantly smacking my lips). This is a great place for a night out paired with a walk around the main building. Everything is beautiful especially in the Fall, and make sure to take in the view of the Hudson River.
We've eaten at a number of the other CIA restaurants, but never at the French one. The Bocuse is a re-boot of the old French restaurant. Since we never went there, I can't really compare. First of all, I have to say this is well worth the experience. You have to remember that this is a cooking school first and a restaurant second, so you are going to see things like servers that drop appetizers, waiters that can't remember menu items, etc. Just relax and enjoy it. Second of all, count yourself lucky if you get a reservation. We've had difficulty, if only because we only happen to be up in the area on rare weekends, so we were limited in our own availability. The place is also really popular. It is also a school, so it does things like close for holidays, when other restaurants would be open. My advice is to plan ahead.  There is an 800 number for reservations. They open at 8 or 8:30, Monday through Friday, and they take reservations a certain number of weeks ahead of time. As soon as you know you will be in the area, make a reservation, or put the date that they start taking reservations into your calendar. Also, be flexible -- we ended up having lunch rather than dinner.  Still an enjoyable experience. Lunch started with a complimentary champagne cocktail. It was prepared at the table, with a nice bit of production. For appetizers, my wife got a salad and my daughter and I each got the salmon tartare. Yum. For dinner, my wife got a lobster stew with winter vegetables, and my daughter and I each got a filet with a red wine reduction with celery root (we are related, after all). Everybody loved their food. For desert, we got the liquid nitrogen ice cream. This starts with a set of small delicacies, served on a wooden platter.  I took a picture and I will see if I can post it.  Then they come and hand-crank the ice cream in front of you, pouring liquid nitrogen into a bowl with a hand mixer (made by the Amish in Pennsylvania we were told). A nice finish to the meal and much recommended by all of us.
We came here on a Saturday afternoon with another couple for lunch. It's approximately a 2-hour drive from NYC and we came here just for the food, so our expectations were quite high for this place. The setting is gorgeous, as you enter there is a huge wall of different wines in a glass showcase. The dining room itself is large, bustling and bright. The setting reminded me of Jean-Georges Restaurant in Central Park West. I had called in ahead to let them know that I was vegan and gluten free, so that they could accommodate for my dietary constraints (it is after all a French restaurant). They were quite understanding about it and said they would put together something for me. After we were seated, we asked for the wine / cocktail listed and they handed us a Ipad. They have an extensive wine list - which you can sort by type, region etc on the Ipad. How convenient and cool! Me and my friend ordered a glass of the Riesling, my boyfriend ordered a glass of the Montepulciano and my friend's boyfriend ordered a frostbite. My Riesling was really good - floral, hint of sweetness and so light and fresh. I liked my boyfriend's Montepulciano as well. I am typically not a huge red wine drinker - but I really liked this one, it was full bodied, not too dry and had a distinct oakiness to it. Last but by far not the least, a word about frostbite - its a tequila cocktail which is made with a serrano pepper infused tequila. It was absolutely delicious! It was a perfectly balanced cool drink, with a very muted heat coming from the serrano and the sweetness and citrus coming from the sugar and lime. It was so good! I am quite picky about cocktails - I don't like them too strong and if they are too watered down or sweet then they taste like juice. This was perfectly balanced. For our appetizers, my friend and I are vegetarian, so we ordered the black kale and arugula salad and sides of Ratatouille Niçoise and grilled leeks. Our boyfriends ordered the dungeness crab to share. Prior to our appetizers being served - they served us amouse bouche - the vegetarian version was a bite size of Caesar salad and a seafood one for the boys. Also, they brought out bread - I was really delighted to see that they could accommodate for gluten free bread for me! The appetizers I thought were really good especially the salad, it was light and tangy. The kale was shredded which made for a even better salad (I am going to try this technique at home). It also came with root vegetable chips which added crunchiness to the dish. The sherry vinaigrette really added a brightness to the salad. For the main course, unfortunately there are not a ton of options for vegetarians. For me they said they could make the warm quinoa and farro salad without the farro (and instead I asked for mushrooms to be added the dish). The presentation while lovely, the dish itself fell short in terms of flavor. It lacked seasoning and the dish itself felt a little bland. The dish comes with a carrot - lemongrass puree, which added sweetness. But it definitely needed some citrus flavors. Overall, I liked the appetizer much better than the entree. That being said, I do understand that this is a French restaurant and as such the vegetarian options are limited. My boyfriend ordered the venison for the entree and my friend's boyfriend ordered the lamb duo. My boyfriend found the venison a little overcooked (he ordered medium rare) and dry. The sauce moscovite served with the venison he found quite delicious - it was a french sauce made with venison stock, currants and wine. I was too full to order dessert. The two boys ordered the nutella hot chocolate and my friend ordered french press coffee. I tasted the coffee and it was quite good and smooth. They also served complimentary truffles and nougat at the end. Overall, I had a great experience here. The service here was so good! Really such a good surprise after you have been served in NYC (even at some of the best restaurants). Our initial waiter George wasn't sure about a lot of the questions that we asked him - but he never got frustated. Instead, he went and asked someone else. For next time, I would recommend coming here in the summer or at least when the weather is decent outside, when you can do other activities around the area and make a day trip out of it.
Dined here for lunch after a tour of the school. We had a great time! The  prix fixe menu was a great deal, appetizer, entree , and dessert for $24.95. For the appetizer I got the gnocchi which was great, so light and airy. My friend got the octopus which was so tender, not chewy at all and perfectly seasoned. For an entree I got the braised short ribs, which were so tender and very flavorful. My brothers monk fish was wasnt as great, didn't really have mich flavor. The dessert was great two of us got the ice cream which they make in front of you, I highly recommend it, neat experience and tasted great! Our server did a great job for being a student, he was able to answer all of our questions. I would definitely come back if I'm ever in the area again!
One of the best meals I have ever had!  Superior presentation married with fantastic food. Braised short ribs to die for. Appe was a wonderful Dungeness crab cake on an avocado spread. Going back tomorrow.
We attended August 22, 2014.  The lunch service was overstaffed on the floor providing the wait staff ample opportunity to basically stalk your table waiting for you to be finished; at that point the plates are wisked out from under you and onto your next course. The staff pushing the ice cream cart (lovely idea) smashed into a pillar while pushing it through the dining area which was loud. Our meals were not all that we would have expected, the chicken leg confit was way too salty, the Barbajuan resembled a taquito more than a pastry.  The drink order which was the 'house special' did not come out as stated on the menu. To sum it up, the excessive watching and removal of items from the table was the worse part and something to be ready for.
My wife & I celebrated our 40th wedding anniversary at Bocuse with friends. Everyone was very happy with the meal and the service. The presentation was perfect and everyone left happily stuffed. If you go, be sure to get the dessert that includes ice cream. It's made at the table and there was so much that none of us was able to finish everything. This was also "Restaurant Week" in our area. Most restaurants have a special menu.  I really liked the way that Bocuse did it. No special menu. Everything was available. Certain items cost a couple of dollars extra. Great idea. If you want a special meal, try it. You will love it as everyone in our party did.

Best value for high-end dining in the state...a three course upscale classic French meal for lunch is $29 for the prix fixe option/ $39 for dinner. This is my first time here since it was formerly Escoffier, and I think everything about it is better now..the setting and the food, not that it was bad before. The dessert sampler with tableside ice cream service was worth the few extra bucks, and the foie gras was outstanding, as was the scallops with pistou foam. The only thing underwhelming was the black truffle soup..I don't feel there was enough truffle essence to it. I highly recommend everyone who is really into food to check out this and other restaurants at the CIA, and other restaurants in the area...it is a nice, affordable change of pace from the expensive restaurants in NYC.

Talk about stepping up their game, the CIA never disappoints and their newest restaurant is just as exceptional as you would expect a place bearing the name of Chef Bocuse (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pa…) Where to start, my wife and I started with the Mushroom Soup and the Lobster Bisque, the Mushroom or Truffle soup was absolutely roll your eyes back in your head good and the Bisque was very well done, only critique was the portion on the bisque was down right miniscule still nice for a taste. Then we went with the crispy frogs legs essentially tempora'd with some herb mayo on the side. Soft, delecate, tender and tasty almost have to have it just due to the stereotype of frogs legs in a French place. After that it was on to the Entrees I had the Lamb Chops and my wife had the Filet, both cooked to perfection and served with some nice seasonal root veggies. Finished with a chocolate dessert and you have a perfect meal.

This is the new French restaurant at the CIA.It's very modern with I PAD wine list and sleek decor .The service is a bit bumbling but pleasant.The food was good and imaginatively presented.I had an escargot appetizer and some type of sea bass.The ecargot could have stood a shot of garlic.The fish was lovely.I finished with a good goat cheesecake. The prices are on the high side but not outlandish.The wine list is solid and by restaurant standards reasonably priced.I tasted my companions lamb- perfect, fogs legs- could have used a shot of garlic but good and their outlandishly entertaining dessert which had  fumes of dry ice with a tea infusion coming off it- it was good but it's the visuals that make it.
Don't mean to cheat anyone by this review but you shouldn't be reading this review you should just experience it !!!!!

I wasn't a fan of Escoffier, the predecessor of this restaurant. I much preferred American Bounty and Katharine d'Medici. But I was willing to give this new place a try, and it didn't disappoint. We had the prix fixe menu. Everything was delicious, as you would expect for a place named after Bocuse. The stuffed quail, a special for the day, was exquisite. The service was very friendly, but they still need to work out the timing. However, when the time between starter and main was getting long, they  brought us an additional appetizer gratis -- before we had a chance to complain. Overall great experience.

Took my wife up to Bocuse to celebrate our wedding anniversary. It was pretty much near perfect, had a slight issue with the wine list, but whatever, the wine was excellent, the food was absolutely phenomenal and the service attentive. My only regret, not ordering the  ice cream made table side with liquid nitrogen! And to top it all of, they gave us some chocolates at the end of the meal which were delectable to say the least! Will definitely return!

Dined here on November 9,2013. The space is beautiful, very french looking. The massive ceiling lights are very deco looking. Make sure you check out the sconces on the walls, they are chefs hats with chefs standing on top of them. We sat very near the kitchen and had a great view of all the hustle and bustle. There was a constant stream of traffic coming out of the kitchen. We were offered bread before dinner, either french rolls or sour dough, we all choose the french rolls. They were excellent,crusty on the outside and chewy on the inside. They were even better with the sweet butter, I could have eaten the butter on its own! Our waiter seemed a bit awkward and nervous and when he gave us the wrong wine glasses he was a but shaken. We didn't realize we were given the wrong glasses but apparently someone told him. I started with the gnocchi Parisienne. The gnocchi were very tiny and light and fluffy,the veal was fork tender and the sauce was very good. I had the braised short ribs for my entree with mushrooms and celeriac, oh my god , I could not stop eating it, it was that good!!!!  Foe dessert I had the vanilla flan over French spice cakes,with casisis spiced pears, peanut brittle and thin pieces of caramelized  sugar. It didn't look like what I expected it to look like, it was very creative and artsy looking. At the end of the meal they brought over a cute wooden box that was a replica of the building we were in and it was filled with homemade jelly candies,chocolate and that Italian nougat candy that begins with a "T" that I can't remember the name. We had a very nice experience and can't wait to come back.

Please note that I am giving them 5 stars for food, but only 3 stars for service.   We were there last night for my birthday dinner (4 people).  The place is beautifully elegant and very open and airy, yet warm and inviting.  Seating was comfortable and tables were spaced nicely. Our first dish was the "amuse bouche" - a tiny but elegant plate with a bite-sized piece of pate, a single potato "chip" (likely from a fingerling potato since it was so small), and a petite spoonful of potato salad.  It was the epitome of an "amuse bouche" and served it's purpose! Three of us ordered their signature dish - the truffle soup.  It was exactly as I had hoped it would be.  Redolent of earthy goodness with a gorgeous puff pasty crown.  Truffles were generously incorporated in the extremely flavorful broth.  It was hot and satisfying - setting the evening for what was to come. We had the frisee salad - and although it was good, it was a little disappointing.  The egg was not quite as runny as it needed to be in order to add to the "dressing" when it was cut open.  The dressing was barely perceptible, considering the ingredients it contained.  Now don't me wrong - I hate overdressed salad, but this was the other end of the spectrum - I couldn't really even tell it was there. Someone else had the escargot (snails), and I was happy to oblige when she offered to let me taste it.  It was incredible.  It was an amazingly flavorful dish without disguising the snails.  I would go so far as to say it was one of the top 10 dishes I have ever tasted.  (I've been to France - and this was exponentially better than the amazing snails I had there!) Let me address the service issues, since it started with our appetizer course. Three of us the truffle soup, and then we ordered a few other appetizers.  Two of us got our soup first, and one of us got our salad first.  We thought they simply made an error and forgot his soup, but that wasn't the case.  When they brought out our next appetizer (salad and snails), that was when they brought his soup.  When we asked why they didn't bring all the soups first, our waiter said that was how he ordered it.  He simply told them which two items he wanted, and they brought them in the order he said it.   It should have been clarified, instead of bringing his salad first, when the rest of the table got their soup first.  When we asked our waiter what would have happened if he ordered his entree, then said he wanted soup, he acknowledged that the soup would have been served first.  It seems like this service glitch wasn't a lack of experience, as much as a lack of simply taking a moment to clarify what the customer actually would like.   During our meal, our waiter was noticeably absent when we needed something.  He was very tentative in his demeanor to the point of being almost painfully shy.  He was very polite, yet he was too soft-spoken.  Now I absolutely understand that this is a teaching facility.  I didn't expect perfection.  I did, however, expect the service to be on par with the prices we paid for our dining experience.  It sadly was not the case.   Even if this was the students first day, or first week in the restaurant, the service should have been better.   Our waiter completely lacked confidence, and it was reflected in the service for our entire meal. Our entrees did not disappoint.  Skate was perfectly prepared, and the accompanying vegetables were as tasty as they were beautiful  I tasted my partners lamb chops, and they were incredibly tender and perfectly medium rare.  The sauce was intensely flavored, complex, and complemented the lamb without overpowering it. Desserts were beautiful works of art and tasted as good as they looked.  The ice cream made tableside was creamy and smooth - pillowy softness of vanilla heaven in a delicate and crispy mini waffle cone. Wine by the bottle was properly priced, and did not disappoint.  We shared two bottles of wine for dinner.  Sparkling water and coffee rounded out our meal. I would definitely come back again for the amazing food, and hope that the service issues have been corrected.
