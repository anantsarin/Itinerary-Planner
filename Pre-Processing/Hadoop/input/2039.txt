I have been frequenting Tea Leaf Cafe since beginning at UB a few years ago. Of the dozen plus times I've been to Tea Leaf, I don't really have many complaints except for the occasional fluke in someone making the bubble tea with not enough flavor and too much ice. (This is rare though) The thing I like about Tea Leaf is that you can ask for less sugar or ice in your drink. As if the amount that's already in bubble tea didn't freak me out enough, I ask for less sugar and skim milk, a great option! Their Thai iced tea is also quite tasty even with skim milk. The only slight complaint I have is the food. I've ordered the scallion pancake and dumplings in the past. Nothing earth shattering. Of course, the focus for Tea Leaf is...well...the bubble tea, so I can't really complain much here, I just wouldn't snack on the food here because it is not worth the price. Definitely your best option for bubble tea in the Buffalo area.
This place was named as such because they don't like you sticking around to drink their goods. They prefer if you order the Tea. Then Leaf. Tea. Leaf. No? Nobody? How adorable! Having just discovered how wonderful Bubble Tea is, I found this place that's almost completely geared towards Bubble Tea! I tried the Passion Fruit, and it was good, but I have to say, not only did I not have that many Bubbles in it (which I don't really care about), but it wasn't as heavenly or perfect tasting as the Passion Fruit Bubble Tea at Gin Gin, and so for that reason, it doesn't quite hit the heights. The prices are okay, and the Bubble Tea is great - there are lots of flavours, I'll be back to maybe try the Pineapple and the Apple sometime. But Gin Gin is still my go to place in the B Lo for the B Tea. And for Coconut Bubble Tea it's all about Niagara Seafood on the west side. Awesomeness.
This place is cool, it has a zen feel.  It's my happy place.  With tons of flavors, lots of options, and some pretty good food it's a must go to tea house. When ordering boba, you choose from 20 something flavors, dark or green tea, fruit or milk. The tea is nice and smooth, the flavors just the right amount, and for me I finish the tea and the boba around the same time so they have the amounts correct.  I just had one and I'm thinking about going back for seconds.  It's that good.  Worth a visit for sure.
This place never disappoints. But for me, I don't have the biggest sweet tooth but I still like the drinks here. I had the Thai iced tea the first time and it was good but a little too sweet for me and then I had the hot Japanese green tea. Very on point. Can't wait to go back to have it again. :)

When I started writing this, my rating was leaning towards a 3. However after my most recent bubble tea run, I can say it is a solid 4. Lychee & loganberry bubble tea with no sugar (the flavor syrups already have sugar) is the business. Life-changing, mind altering, game changer of bubble teas. I almost exclusively get milk-based flavors and boy am I glad I dared to deviate from my norm. My favorite milk combo is the Almond Joy (chocolate, almond, coconut). I've been coming here since the demise of Bao and I was getting tired of the same ole boba. There is a board on the left side by the register with flavor combo suggestions and it is awesome. I get to try something different each visit. I'm not the most imaginative person and it takes work to come up with decent flavor combinations (I tend to over think it) so that board is a time saver. They've also started offering banh mi on Friday and Saturday but at $5.95 plus tax, it better be an earth shattering experience. Of the bubble tea cafes in the area, Tea Leaf has the most flavor variety. If you don't like tapioca, you can get other add-ons like jelly for an additional cost. For those who don't like sweetened tea and prefer a different experience, Tea Leaf also has loose leaf tea which can be ordered by the cup/mug or pot. Generally, I'm not too impressed with their loose tea selection. Much of it is tea leaves with added flavoring e.g. birthday cake tea which does not appeal to me at all. I've had pots of the silver needle and tie guan yin which were nice. For small plates, the pan-fried dumplings (veggie, pork, or chicken), edamame, and scallion pancake are on point. If you're in a hurry, boiled dumplings will do. There's free Wi-Fi so it's a nice spot to hang out with friends, study, or just chill on your own. During the school year, it tends to get crowded and really noisy. The last few times I've been there, the tables have been a little grimy and the floor super sticky. It also took them forever and a minute to replace the broken couches.

This place exudes comfort, simplicity and GREAT bubble tea ! They are fast, efficient and knowledgeable about the flavors and taste. The bubble tea smoothies are awesome ! I've tried the popular seller Coconut Taro (excellent), My family members have tried Pineapple Coconut , Kiwi and Honeydew and the flavors are spot on. The Red Velvet cake is also pretty good. Don't leave this place out...give it a try

The staff is super friendly and always attentive. I feel like they have tried a combination of every flavor since they always have some new crazy recommendations haha. Try the Taro and Japanese Green, you will not regret it. The tea is a lot better than the Kung Fu Tea on campus and it is a lot less sugary. Always makes me feel less guilty about drinking it.

Our absolute favorite bubble tea place! So many flavors to choose from, and they are so accommodating!!

I often find myself here meeting friends before going to see a movie at the AMC Theater (those reclining seats have me driving out to Amherst every time). Tea Leaf Cafe is a comfy place to enjoy some bubble tea and light foods. We enjoyed some pan-seared dumplings here with mushrooms and potatoes and they were crispy with fresh ingredients inside served with a nice side of soy sauce (which was a little on the vinegar side). I had "yogurt" bubble tea, served cold over black tea and it was delicious as usual. Every time I've enjoyed bubble tea here, I've been pleased. The coffee and desserts are quite delicious as well. Lots of college kids hang out here to study since it's very close to UB's North Campus, but it's also not a bad place to go for one of those initial coffee dates or just to catch up with friends. Good for groups too as there are a number of couches and large tables. Another ++ for reliable wifi and this ends up being a fine place to hang out, kick back or study.

Renovations going on so no seating inside...big new serving area/kitchen coming up. Good bubble tea as always...ask them for interesting flavor combinations like Crack

I stopped by here for some bubble tea since I was waiting for my hotel room to be serviced. The place is clean and large. There are leather sofas that were comfortable to sit at. The staff is friendly and made my red bean bubble tea quickly. The bubble tea was delicious. The tapioca pearls weren't too soft or hard (some places seriously cannot get this down right!). They had so many amazing flavors! Definitely would go back if I'm in the area!

Everything I've tried here has been delicious! Love their honeydew bubble tea smoothies and their Thai iced tea. The spring rolls are tasty and I love the sauce that goes with them. My son loves the mango bobas and lychee bits in his drink :) I love the flavor suggestions they give on the board as well!

Yes I've had better bubble tea in my life. However, this place tops any other bubble tea I've had in the Buffalo-Rochester area. But what I was most impressed about was their efficiency. I walked in with a group of 17 other people thirsty for bubble tea 20 minutes prior to closing. Within 15 minutes, everyone was sipping their drinks happily. I was rather impressed we had 5 minutes to spare.

If you like bubble tea this is the place for you. They have over 2 dozen different types and you can combine them as well. I had a basic coconut milk bubble tea and it was very good. I wish it was a bit thicker in texture but it wasn't to sweet and the flavor wasn't lacking in the least. Prices aren't bad but I'm new to bubble tea so I haven't yet established much of a baseline for pricing. The location itself is warm and inviting. There are several cozy looking couches as well as tables. I couldn't say for sure if they were cozy because I got my tea and left but it did look promising. If I lived in the area this would be a great hangout spot. With so many drinkable options and lots of places to sit this is a great little place. Also they have lychee and rainbow bubbles if your looking for something a bit different.

Strictly speaking on bubble tea, definitely one of the must-go-places when I visit Buffalo. They have an extremely wide variety of teas ranging from milk and fruit related. My favorite is the red bean smoothie and with pretty decent prices for what you get I high suggest checking it out if you are nearby! Great place for students and the general public alike, it's hard to tell when the rushes are, but grab a seat on the couch and enjoy a moment with your bubble tea. Wish there was one nearby in Rochester! We need one desperately with as much variety and quality!

I have been going in and around buffalo and have stayed here for 2 years.. I must say, I have had better iced tea and better cappuccino for sure.. The iced tea is way too watery and runny.. The cappuccino lacks flavor of coffee.. The only thing good about the place is the interiors and staff.. 3 starts hence.. Come on guys, you can make the drinks better..

I would have given 3 stars but the extra star is due to their flavor variety and options. I've been to several other bubble tea places and none of them had this much variety. And I'm not much of a "I only order my unique Starbucks drink" kind of person, but the mixed-flavored bubble teas come out tasting oddly good and smooth, in addition to their fairly tasty classic drinks on the menu, which I think they deserve credit for. Plus, you can pretty much mix anything together - fruits w coffee flavor, chocolate w fruit flavors, etc. My go-to drink is Taro Coconut Avocado Bubble Tea w/ black tea. I'm a huge Taro fan but sometimes I get sick of its milky aftertaste, so the Coconut & Avocado give it a nice perk. Also, it's a great hang-out spot. Chill yet fun atmosphere, with good music (sometimes a bit obnoxious and too loud). They have the most comfortable sofa, which I'm skeptical to sit on, now that I've went often enough to be able to count on an avg how many people would sit on it per day. And, the bubbles are good. I'm super picky with the texture of tapioca in my bubble teas, but theirs is chewy enough - until you leave it in your iced drink for a few more hours. They become rock hard, pretty quick. Overall, I would go here every so often after eating a meal!

I love this place. The decor is nice and the staff is super friendly. They're always willing to give you recommendations on what to try. I've had a lot of different bubble teas here and haven't found one yet that I didn't like. Their food is really good too, I especially like the scallion pancake. Make sure you ask them for a punch card - every 11th bubble tea is free!

My favorite bubble tea!  There are so many choices. The first time I went here, I told the staff member at the counter that I'd never had bubble tea and wanted to try it.  She happily explained all of the different combinations of bubble teas and made sure my choices made sense together.  I've gone back many times since the first time.   Service is always fast and excellent.  The cafe is very clean, has nice seating options and free internet.

Tea Leaf goes in my pretentious list of "Suburban places I wish were in the city/closer to where I live".  Anyway, trekking into the nondescript plaza for bubble tea is worth it.  It's packed away between a bunch of new suburban bars that I have only heard of in name.  Inside is very cozy and inviting (couches!!). My review is just for bubble tea, which I have had here twice.  Both times were awesome.  It's funny how years ago, I hated bubble tea with a burning passion... and now I find myself craving it!  The first time I went, I had the strawberry fruit tea, which is a nice option if you aren't craving the milk-based ones.  It was refreshing and light.  This time however, I got the coffee bubble tea, and was very impressed.  I was going to get sesame, but my boyfriend ordered it and I have a huge thing about two people getting the same thing, so I ordered something else. I find that the tapioca here is very fresh, if that makes sense.  It's got the perfect amount of chew, and all the teas are expertly prepared and delicious!  This is definitely my favorite place to get bubble tea because of that.  You can also get extra tapioca for $.25 I think.  Who knew!

I've come here several times now and love every bit of it! I just recently learned it's only 25 cents for extra pearls in my tea, so next time I'll have to do that, because I love the pearls. The flavors are always good, I've had milk and fruit based teas, and they're both good. They are decently priced. Service-wise, I've never had a rude or otherwise staff serve me. They've always seemed pretty nice. I would strongly recommend a place like this for your first bubble tea, or even just your next bubble tea.

Good food, good atmosphere. My first time here, I ordered a passion fruit green tea with rainbow jellies and an amaretto cake. It was very good! I was thoroughly surprised that it tasted like real tea that had been flavored with a just a hint of passion fruit syrup. The cake was very moist and the frosting tasted more milky/creamy than sugary, which I like. The atmosphere is very young/hipster/college-y. Lots of UB students hang out here. Sometimes people are here doing work but most of the time, it's a place to connect with friend and chat until they kick you out of the shop. I like it a lot. Will be coming back.

I've been here on more than a few occasions especially to kill time  before or after a movie at the AMC next door.   Overall it's alright.   Staff is friendly enough but not overly friendly.   The drinks taste good enough but if you have ventured to NYC you will likely be more disappointed than satisfied.   However that said it's definitely worth going to occasionally or at least once with a small group of friends over the weekend to over load in gossip and sugar simultaneously.   There are plenty of choices and the desserts and snacks aren't half bad. What gives it only a 3 is that there is simply nothing special bout this place.   Kinda like taking a friend to prom.  Yeah you got a date but you know there will be no magic to the evening.   So is it worth going simply to go?   You decide!

Ahhh... Boba, Tapioca, Bubble Tea, whatever you want to call it, I am a fan. After living so long in California, I was used to finding Boba easily (and cheaply). I was happy to learn of Tea Leaf Cafe. I wish they had more hot options, but hard to complain with the extensive list that they have. I also think the food is pretty yummy. Try the potstickers. Nice big place to hang out or to study.

Saw a sign for a tea shop and pulled into the Plaza.  Wasn't easy to find but glad I did. With no expectations in mind,  I was impressed with the unique selection.  I've never seen thai iced tea on a menu outside a thai restaurant.  I was excited.  There's a $5 credit card minimum so I was forced to get some food too.  Ordered chicken and mushroom dumplings. 15 minute wait was the downside, but they did warn me before finalizing the order.

Tea Leaf Cafe is a trendy bubble tea lounge that offers a wide array of delicious teas and snacks. When you enter through the doors, you're greeted with a super comforting ambience with the decor being a priority; even the logo on the drinks looks great! The menu is extensive and covers all sorts of different boba and tea, which of all I tried, are excellent. They also serve food here including dumplings and ph which are a lot better than you would expect, coming from a boba shop. This place offers an awesome atmosphere to sip your boba and relax with your friends on a rainy day. Also, the place offers free Wi-Fi here which tops off the experience! Whether you want a nice place to chill with your friends, or you're cramming for an exam, try Tea Leaf Cafe. It's truly a gem in Buffalo.

I love Kung Fu Tea at UB but Tea Leaf has better selection of regular and mixed flavors. Their bubble tea is a little on the sweet side but you can adjust to your taste. I got the taro coconut combination with tapioca pearls and rainbow jelly. It was delicious and beyond my expectations. I would definitely come back for more bubble tea, at Tea Leaf. Great location and fair prices.

I ordered bubble black milk tea. Bubble is not so tasty as well as other tea shops, but still acceptable. Tea is good, worthy paying. The store is really cozy and relaxing with couches or tables. After all, it's a good place to chill out with friends.

Tasty boba! There are places where you can taste that the boba had been sitting out for a while and it doesn't keep its chewy texture for very long. But everything, including the tea and boba, tasted very fresh here. The shake was a bit sweet to our taste but they were more than glad to whip up another one with a little less flavoring powder. They have a bunch of cakes available as well which we will be sure to try soon!

My favorite bubble tea spot! and the only bubble tea place that lets you mix flavors
Tasty boba! There are places where you can taste that the boba had been sitting out for a while and it doesn't keep its chewy texture for very long. But everything, including the tea and boba, tasted very fresh here. The shake was a bit sweet to our taste but they were more than glad to whip up another one with a little less flavoring powder. They have a bunch of cakes available as well which we will be sure to try soon!
LOVE THIS PLACE! I go as much as possible! They need to open a tea leaf in Rochester! I absolutely LOVEEE the honeydew milk tea! The food is alright.. I tried the Scallion pancakes from there and in my opinion it tasted just like dough. Not enough scallions, just a bunch of their "pancake mix." It doesn't matter though. Most people go just for the bubble tea! Their staff is amazing! One time my cousin ordered the wrong drink, and the staff didn't mind making her a new one!

My friend and I go here about every other week. We love the atmosphere and the bubble tea is to die for! There are so many flavors and combinations to try. I've tried other bubble tea places and they pale in comparison. The cheesecake and dumplings are also really good!
Came here for bubble tea, and was fairly impressed. It's a cute and cozy little tea shop that my friends and I chill in. The couches are so comfy and its hard not to fall aslerp from how comfortable everything is! The people here are very nice and it's right off the campus of Buffalo university, so it's a perfect hang out spot for students Drinks-wise, theres really nothing to complain about. Its very good and I'm definitely coming back for more and more!

The 1 star comes out due to the ambiance. The leather sofa and dim light was fine. But that's all the pro for this place. OK. Here are the cons: 1. The service is unbelievably slow. I think the man making bubble tea is a green hand. We have waited for over 20 mins for 4 bubble teas. We are killing time before watching movies in AMC(which I suppose is why most people come here) but we almost ran late because of this server. 2. The service manner. They always kept poker face and never squeezed a smile, never providing any suggestion. When I asked if they could punch my Tea Leaf Card(I probably won't use that card any more) for us four cups, the counter said they could only punch for one transaction. Never heard of that before. I have tasted bubble tea in Minneapolis, NYC and China, NO OTHER STORE did like this one. 3. The bubble tea itself. My Japanese Green Tea was just as unsweetened as water! The bubble was really of low quality and too powdery. And a customer even asked to return bubble tea because it tasted like perfume! I guess this store could be open because it's located in Buffalo and near AMC theater. If this store opened in NYC, I guess it could be closed within a week. NEVER NEVER NEVER go there back again!

I am a huge fan of this place.  I come out of this place double fisted because I cannot make up my mid which drinks to get.  Bubble tea or bubble tea smoothie.  All good.  And mango jelly.  I have got to have that too.   It is wonderful to have bubble tea near campus too.  I can't wait to get another flavour.

Used to be a great place until the store has hired a bunch of amateurs who can't make decent bobas. The bobas in my tea have become very soggy and disgusting. Bobas are the most crucial things I look for at a tea cafe like this, and if you can't keep up with the quality you don't deserve my money. I've given this place 3 chances, yet no improvements were seen. Kung Fu Tea has just opened up nearby and I would recommend that place over this.

A girlfriend introduced me to this place. I've had the bubble tea and random appetizers here. The service has always been good. The bubbles are good, the tea is good, the food is very good as well. A very good place to stop by with friends to sit around and chat. So far this is the best bubble tea I've had in WNY.

I had the Mango Rooibos with milk and honey. It was very delicious and perfectly sweetened. I also ordered pan-seared pork & chive dumplings. The mistake was probably that I ordered them to be pan-seared. Since they were busy, and their primary business is drink making and not food, they were burned. Kudos on turning them over where the burned sides were down because presentation counts. :-D The inside of the dumplings were good, but if I try the dumplings again, I will opt for the steamed instead of pan-seared. The desserts looked amazing. Chocolate cakes and Tiramisu and cheesecake!! I am in heaven.  I am a huge fan of bubble tea, so I will try one on the next visit.

Tea Leaf Cafe is definitely one of the better places in the area for a good bubble tea. The boba have always been of good texture and taste and they have such a wide array of flavors you could easily go back again and again and always have something new. The food is pretty good, being freshly made is a big plus and the service has always been great as well. They were even nice enough to warn me about the durian (I already knew the risk and went for it anyway), my recommendation... DON'T GET THE DURIAN! However, the blueberry/lemon combination is a good choice!

Let me start by saying that I am an incoming freshman at UB who has lived in California all her life. Needless to say, I have been utterly spoiled by the broad array of Asian foods in both the Bay and LA (surrounding) areas. I was unsure of what to expect when I got to Buffalo, so I turned to Yelp to find some places I could possibly hit up when those feelings of homesickness kick in and I want a little taste of home/Asia... So I searched up restaurants, blah blah, and then decided to try my luck by typing "boba" in the search bar. To be honest, I was a little nervous y'all, but I took up the courage and clicked that button. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised to find a boba place! Okay, "pleasantly surprised" is an understatement because I was ESSITED *dancing in seat*. Might be a little strange, but it's the truth... I was like "Say whaa?! There's boba in Buffalo?! OMG, 4 stars!!!", fanning myself in the process. Alright, no more of that silly nonsense. Let's get down to business...to defeat the Huns. Went to Tea Leaf Cafe with the fambam the weekend before my orientation. I got the peach green tea, my mom got the forest mango green tea, and my little brother got the Japanese green milk tea. When we got them, the coloring of each drink looked promising, so we were unprepared for the rude awakening that followed... My peach green tea tasted like sugary water with a HINT of tea. Mama's mango green tea: water with slight tea flavoring with maybe, MAYBE a small mango aftertaste Brehski's green milk tea: milky water with just a tad of green tea flavor The boba: some weren't cooked all the way, but meh, 'twas aiite Okay, first off, tea is supposed to taste like tea. Maybe I'm used to "strong" teas from when we go to yum cha or even from drinking HK-style milk tea, but really, no tea should taste so bland...it tasted like water. Even if they don't brew a strong tea for the drink, couldn't they at least add more of the flavoring? I wasn't paying attention when they were making the drinks (nor was I too observant of my drink when I got it, heh) so I can't confirm this, but I read other reviews that say they use POWDER?! Why no TEA LEAVES, TEA LEAF Cafe?! *blank stare*...So disappoint. For some reason I got the large cup too (which I did not ask for, hm...)! Call me picky, spoiled, wasteful, or whatever, but I did not want to finish that drink. I asked my dad if he could finish it because he's usually the "trash can" (for a lack of better words) of the family, but even he didn't want my drink! He made a face like DX and said in Cantonese, "Yo drank taste terrible! At least Mommy and Joshua's are somewhat drinkable." So then my mom took my drink and gave hers to my dad. Yeah... The end. I'm sorry if I was too harsh :S After reading my "review" you're probably thinking that I wouldn't want to come to this place again. However, being a fairly reasonable and open-minded person, I am willing to give Tea Leaf Cafe a second chance. Maybe it was partially our fault. Maybe we chose the wrong drinks. Maybe they haven't mastered the drinks we tried yet. Maybe, just maybe we should have tried the drinks recommended by other Yelpers... In any case, I'll be back with an open mind and heart, Tea Leaf Cafe. I hope that we can become good friends in the future. Don't let me down.

I'm a big fan of bubble tea so I had to stop here whilst visiting some friends in town. We went on a Friday night and it was really packed in there. It got even more busy when we left about 45 minutes later. There are tables and chairs in there as well as comfortable sofas to relax in while enjoying your tea. We ordered something called the "TLC Crack" which comprised of Taro and Coconut. It was really delicious, which explains it's 'crack' nickname. The prices seemed pretty reasonable too. If you're looking for some good bubble tea in a nice setting, then this is the place to be.
This place looked so inviting from the cold parking lot.  The windows were all steamy and light seemed to twinkle in their reflections.  Inside it was warm and cozy. I realize that I'm behind the learning curve if I've yet to taste my first bubble tea.  But I wanted my first time to be well... special. With the help of the smiling staff I chose and, at a quiet table, sipped slowly from the bubble straw and savored the silky flavors of Hot Coconut and Black Tea.  I paused as pearls of tapioca played across my tongue and... Do you remember your first - Bubble Tea? ::wink:: ...Five days later and I'm back, with my son in tow, looking for dessert and more great teas.   Staff are very knowledgeable and offered several suggestions which we loved.   It was kinda late so we didn't try anything savory from their menu but that's the plan for next time.  No matter what happens Tea Leaf Cafe, you'll always be my first... Bubble Tea.
I think I'm leaning a little more towards 2 stars than 3, but there are a few perks about this place that give it a solid a-ok. So...first things first! One of my favorite things about this place is that you can order a whole pot of loose-leaf tea, of which there is a wide variety, and just fill the pot with hot water for hours on end while, and this brings me to my second favorite thing, you sit at a table and study while utilizing their wifi! My third favorite thing is that they have scallion pancakes, which are arguably my favorite food ever. The pancakes themselves are only okay, but it does well in a pinch, and they are few and far between here in Bflo, so no real complaints. Don't forget to ask for black vinegar, soy sauce, and sriracha. Every time I go, they tell me that they don't have black vinegar, but then they look, and they always do. Mix the three together and it makes a bomb sauce. So onto some of my not favorite things: First, not a fan of their boba. AT ALL. Second, no veggie dumplings, despite claiming to have them for a VERY long time. On my most recent trip there, they had finally taken it off the menu completely, which is VERY unfortunate, since outside of the scallion pancake and their veggie spring rolls (which are also only okay), there are no other vegetarian food options. The final downside plays off of one of the pluses; although there is wifi and unlimited tea, making this a seemingly ideal place to study, their loud music combined with the often incredibly rambunctious undergrad crowd makes it very difficult to concentrate. I've been here several times during off hours and have been able to get quite a bit done, but this is definitely more of a social hub than a work-friendly cafe. For me, the not-favorite things sort of trump the good, but I still come here when I'm looking for more variety/craving scallion pancakes. The loose-leaf tea is a really huge draw for me. I love me my Chinese teas.

I decided to take my two teenagers here today as a bit of a fun treat since none of us had ever tried boba before. We all had green tea as a base and they got the chocolate/banana and chocolate/coconut blends and I got myself almond/honeydew. Of course we all passed them around to try the different combinations. Having never had boba  before I cannot attest to what the 'perfect' texture of them should be, but to each of us they seemed to be of a pleasing texture, still having some chew to them so they were not all mushy, but not so much that they didn't feel cooked. We also shared two small plates. The chicken mushroom dumplings and the steamed pork buns. Both came with the same wonderful dipping sauce. Everything was absolutely delicious, and it is definitely a place we will return. The food was well made, flavorful, and  the service was very pleasant. I can see this as a place we will return many times. As refreshing as the boba was in January, I can only imagine how much more so it will be come summer. So glad I read all the reviews here first, or we might not have ever found it. It is tucked way around the back of the shopping center. The prices were reasonable (no more expensive than starbucks, and the food was sure a whole lot higher quality!) With out bill coming to $21 for the three bubble tea's and two side plates (with a coupon from the Entertainment book that gave us one item free.) There is already talk of the next time we go, with requests for friends to come along with us.

This review is way overdue. I haven't really been to Tea Leaf lately, but the last time I went - it was pretty good. I finally got to try the avocado bubble tea that has been evading me for the longest time and it was good. The bubbles were nice and soft - almost too soft actually, but when the cold drink makes them a little harder - they were perfect. I think the thing that really turns me on about this place is that the owners really care about this place and take all the reviews into consideration as one of the owners contacted me to try Tea Leaf again with a bubble tea on the house. Things like that really make my heart smile because it means that they genuinely care. :) And just to make sure that things were not skewed because they knew who I was - I did go there the week after to order the same thing and it was just as good! I do think that they need to work a bit on their flavors because some of them are still ehh.

Terribly disappointed, after reading the other reviews I was having high hopes of good quality bubble tea. I went with the classic milk tea thinking it was the safest one to go with. How could you go wrong? Well it turned out to be way to sweet, not enough tea and too powdery. But at least  the boba was cooked just right. I'm so disappointed I can't even finish my bubble tea!

When I am having a cup of tea with a friend I look for good tea and good atmosphere.  This place does NOT provide the atmosphere - its not very warm and welcoming with only to-go service. I am never asked if I would like to it in a mug, everyone gets the service of "take this and leave my place". The other problem is the service - when I asked the lady behind the counter if she would recommend a particular tea she said she never had it. OK, but someone must have tried it before you started selling it. She never offerred to get someone who knew more of the teas to explain the flavors of this particular tea I have never had. It was certainly not my favorite place event after a second chance. I will not go back there for tea - ever again!!

This place rates somewhere between a "Meh" and a "Yay!", so it gets three stars. The Meh: terrible college radio rock, weak lattes, and difficult-to-find location (it's tucked away near the AMC at the corner of Sweet Home and Maple, and easy to miss). The Yay: a menu with most prices under $5, including handmade dumplings, steamed edamame, and bubble tea (which is otherwise hard to find in B-lo!). And another big yay for the free wi-fi and quiet atmosphere, which makes this place a nice indie coffeeshop outpost in a desert of chain coffeeshops near UB North. Overall, the Yay outweighs the Meh here. This cafe's definitely worth a stop if you're in the Northtowns and looking for a quiet place to chat with a friend, eat a healthy, cheap, light meal, and/or get some work done.
I'd like to think of myself as a bit of a bubble tea connoisseur. I travel far and wide in search of the best Bubble Teas (and by far and wide, I mean from Long Island to Main Street in Flushing, NYC Chinatown...and in this case, Amherst). The Bubble Tea at Teaf Leaf Cafe is second to none. I have sampled the following: Taro, Honeydew and Mango Milk Teas and the Passion Fruit and Lychee Fruit Teas with extra bubbles, please and thank you). I have also dined on the Edamame, Pork and Chive Dumplings and Shanghainese Soup Dumplings. The Soup Dumplings were a little disappointing. *Disclaimer: I did not consume all above-mentioned foods in one trip. I swear. :) The atmosphere invites you to sit around a table and chat with your friends. Free wi-fi is always awesome! And the staff members are friendly. I say, go to Tea Leaf and get some Bubble Tea and snacks. You won't be disappointed!

For me giving out 5 stars is tough.  This place is great and a fun place to meet up with friends.  Great tea and small plates.  I've never had dessert.

THE best Bubble Tea spot in Buffalo! This place is solid, there is plenty of space to sit, hang out, study, and their drinks/desserts/food are amazing! Their Bubble Tea menu is massive and no matter which flavor you are craving, they have it! Their prices are great, the tea and boba are perfectly made, and their staff is friendly, helpful, and knowledge with all things bubble tea! I used to live in Buffalo and every single time I come back and visit (which is frequently) I always make a pit stop here for some! If you're craving some bubble tea or haven't tried it before, this is the place to go in Buffalo! Stop on it! :) PS: If you like milk based tea, try the Taro..and for non-milk, their peach is excellent! Mix a variety of flavors as well!

The Meh: terrible college radio rock, weak lattes, and difficult-to-find location (it's tucked away near the AMC at the corner of Sweet Home and Maple, and easy to miss). The Yay: a menu with most prices under $5, including handmade dumplings, steamed edamame, and bubble tea (which is otherwise hard to find in B-lo!). And another big yay for the free wi-fi and quiet atmosphere, which makes this place a nice indie coffeeshop outpost in a desert of chain coffeeshops near UB North. Overall, the Yay outweighs the Meh here. This cafe's definitely worth a stop if you're in the Northtowns and looking for a quiet place to chat with a friend, eat a healthy, cheap, light meal, and/or get some work done.
I gave the Tea Leaf Café 2 stars merely for its ambiance.  Its cute, relatively quiet and has comfy couches.  The boba tea and boba smoothies are ok but definitely not the best I've ever had. The scallion pancake tasted of pure butter and was made of filo dough.  Seriously, that is NOT a scallion pancake.  My friend and I could not finish one because it was so saturated in butter. The mushroom spring roll was gross.  It just had a really odd taste to it. If you want really really good boba tea and authentic Asian food then go to Gin Gin on Sheridan.  They are awesome.
I'd like to think of myself as a bit of a bubble tea connoisseur. I travel far and wide in search of the best Bubble Teas (and by far and wide, I mean from Long Island to Main Street in Flushing, NYC Chinatown...and in this case, Amherst). The Bubble Tea at Teaf Leaf Cafe is second to none. I have sampled the following: Taro, Honeydew and Mango Milk Teas and the Passion Fruit and Lychee Fruit Teas with extra bubbles, please and thank you). I have also dined on the Edamame, Pork and Chive Dumplings and Shanghainese Soup Dumplings. The Soup Dumplings were a little disappointing. *Disclaimer: I did not consume all above-mentioned foods in one trip. I swear. :) The atmosphere invites you to sit around a table and chat with your friends. Free wi-fi is always awesome! And the staff members are friendly. I say, go to Tea Leaf and get some Bubble Tea and snacks. You won't be disappointed!
The Tea Leaf Cafe is great.  Its a miracle it exists in Western New York. I grew up in Buffalo but spent most of my adult life in New York City.  I frequent visit high end tea locals (San Francisco, NYC, Portland, London) and the Tea Leaf Cafe is as good as it can be in this area. Like the dumplings and the pho, the management is professional and hospitable.  Fast internet!  Willing to make drinks to order (Iced peppermint with fresh lemon yesterday). Good job, guys.
For me giving out 5 stars is tough.  This place is great and a fun place to meet up with friends.  Great tea and small plates.  I've never had dessert.
Tea Leaf Cafe is great for when you are craving boba tea. I tasted cold versions of the taro, original, and papaya- and they were very sweet and flavorful. The boba was soft and chewy, not over or under cooked. The drinks range from $3.50- 4.25; a bit more expensive than your typical boba places in nyc or boston, but I actually like how much more flavorful these are compared to St. Alps, Fay Da, Boston Tea Stop. They have a lot of teas (rooibos, blacks, greens, and a few different twists on chai) and coffee drinks available. They have a few desserts (slices of cake, tiramisu, cupcakes) at the counter and some chinese snacks- I got soup dumplings, but they were on the smaller side and didn't have that much soup. One issue is finding the location, as it's sort of in the back/side of its rundown shopping plaza. The inside contrasts a lot to its eyesore surroundings.  Buffalo restaurants/cafes as a whole don't seem to care about ambiance and decorating- but this place is very bright and cute (think of your typical asian cafe).  It's very quiet inside and a great place to do work or study. Overall, the cafe is great for studying, meeting up with friends, and drinks- I'm hoping it stays afloat.
THE best Bubble Tea spot in Buffalo! This place is solid, there is plenty of space to sit, hang out, study, and their drinks/desserts/food are amazing! Their Bubble Tea menu is massive and no matter which flavor you are craving, they have it! Their prices are great, the tea and boba are perfectly made, and their staff is friendly, helpful, and knowledge with all things bubble tea! I used to live in Buffalo and every single time I come back and visit (which is frequently) I always make a pit stop here for some! If you're craving some bubble tea or haven't tried it before, this is the place to go in Buffalo! Stop on it! :) PS: If you like milk based tea, try the Taro..and for non-milk, their peach is excellent! Mix a variety of flavors as well!
Ever since a friend of mine introduced me to Bubble tea a few years back, I have become a bubble tea junkie. So when I moved to Buffalo, one of the first things I did was I searched for any place with this nectar of the gods (if you're not a fan, then you are missing out!) Not only did I find this place, but so far one of the best places to get Bubble Tea out side of Flushing, Queens NY! SO MANY VARIETIES of not just Bubble tea, but of tea in general. They even have your run of the mill southern sweet tea! This place is always busy, mostly students from the campus near by, but there is a generous amount of seating. And the decor is pretty laid back with a touch of Asian fusion mixed in. Its a decent place to go grab a drink and a snack with friends, or just a refreshing beverage while you finish up some work. It can get very busy and very loud during the weekends and evenings, but for me that's just a sign that this place is doing something right! Also, it is conveniently located next to a movie theater, for pre- or post-movie going hang outs. So if you need a break from your usual skinny latte or overly pretentious coffee house, I recommend checking this place out!

This is going to be the most quality bubble tea around the Buffalo area. They also have a wide selection of premium grade tea leaves and espresso drinks. Prices are similar to Starbucks, and presents a very relaxed atmosphere for small gatherings and chatting amongst colleagues and friends. The owners at extremely chill and friendly. They really care about the quality of the products, and customer feedback.

I'm a west coaster. And a true boba addict! Buffalonians love their wings. I love my boba. So I've had bubble tea (or I like to call it boba) from L.A. to San Fran. Been living here for about 5 years now. It fits the stereotypical commercial boba restaurant. But that makes sense because boba is a trendy pop type of thing. I was very happy to find this place recently. Yes, it's only one of a few places here in Buffalo but I can honestly say it's as good as you can get. I know this is new to Buffalonians but there are chains of boba places from the U.S. to Australia that have the more Chinese feel to it. You'll see that all over San Fran and even the suburbs of greater Los Angeles. I don't like those places because they don't prep their boba correctly. Just like sushi, when you've had plenty you will significantly taste the difference. I was actually impressed with their dumplings that my friend recently ordered. I tend not to order food at a boba place because it's pretty generic and standard. I usually don't recommend food at a boba place, but I recommend their dumplings. Very good!!! Restaurant quality. The decor is nice. Like I said before trendy so I can imagine the owners might not be from around here. I'm guessing NYC. They set the place up with the right demographic in mind. College students and true city dwellers like myself. I don't believe they have wi-fi yet. I think they should. This is a place I know I would chill out and do work. When I really like a place I introduce it to my friends. So far I've taken 3 friends there. And of course I have to do a review on yelp. Buffalonians come try this place. **Be warned. You're either going to love the texture of boba or not.** And it's quite filling in the belly. But they do prepare it the right way. So 5 stars for that alone. But there are so many flavors that I know you'll find something you will like. Smoothies to teas. Great city chillaxing vibe. And it hits the spot during summer. If you do fall in love with the place, be sure you get a frequent flyer miles boba card (that's not what's it called. just my terms. :-) ) Update 2/5/13 Still an awesome place.  And they do have wifi. It's just not posted anywhere. It's pretty much open your laptop and it picks it up. Much better than places like Spot where you have to ask for a password and there's a time limit of 2 hours. That's annoying. Also, try out the most popular flavors from Almond Milk to Taro. And if you can't handle too much boba then you can always ask them to do half the amount. So you don't have to call it a guilty pleasure. Ha! Quality of Boba - 5 stars Ambiance (with wifi for studying and good music for chillaxin') - 4.5 stars Speed of service - 4 stars Customer service - 4.5 stars Noise level - 4 stars Beverage menu (which is gi-normous) - 5 stars Good for your health - 2.7 stars Good for your soul - 5 stars (added bonus) good snack food - 4.8 stars Overall - 5 stars

Love Tea Leaf Cafe!  Excellent staff and delicious bubble tea...   I drive across WNY to get my bubble tea fix at TLC.  Great atmosphere too...

Great place!! Great atmosphere!! Its new, classy and a great place to just chill. The people there are very nice and friendly and service are always fast. You will not be able to find a bubble tea place better than this any where near there. I've tried their taro bubble tea, original bubble tea and their yogurt flavor bubble tea and all of them were delicious. It is a must try.. and while you are there they also have sweets and asian food too. I've tried their spring rolls and they tasted great but the price for 3 spring rolls was alittle extreme.. about $4

Try the mango slushie; it's Buffalos best kept secret. Don't skimp on the tapioca either! I also think it is endearing that the boss/manager (Peter) reads these reviews and upholds a social media presence. With buffalo restaurants especially, I find that rare... but it's a wise thing to do!

Tea Leaf Cafe is probably the best place to get boba drinks, or 'bubble tea' as it's called in the east coast, but it's also generally pretty pricey ($3.50-5). Especially when you see all of their powder canisters behind the counter. I have yet to find a better place, so this will have to do for now. ): There is also an extensive menu for snacks as well as desserts (cheesecake, chocolate cake, etc.). The service varies sometimes. Some days they can be pretty slow at making their drinks and other times they're good. There's plenty of table space and a couple couches, so it's great for catching up with friends and maybe for light studying since there's free wi-fi (sometimes the music is too loud to study). Overall ambiance is good.
Love Tea Leaf Cafe!  Excellent staff and delicious bubble tea...   I drive across WNY to get my bubble tea fix at TLC.  Great atmosphere too...
For Buffalo, this place isn't too bad.  I'm glad someone started a boba place because Buffalo was seriously lacking one that was worthwhile to visit. I like the wide selection and the customer service is top notch but their only problem is that they're a tad bit too expensive (especially their foods).  Otherwise, I'd go here more often as their drinks and foods aren't half bad.  Of course, it doesn't compare to those served in NYC or Los Angeles but it's the best we got and I hope they're in business for a long time!

The Bubble tea is great, most of the time the desserts are fresh but sometimes they taste old. I would say 2-2 tasted fresh. And the location is great but the the couches are beat and tables are dirty a lot of the time. They are making good enough money they need a upgrade! And also to focus on getting staff out on the floor cleaning the tables and chairs. They are really nice and efficient.

I love this place! Great bubble tea place in Buffalo! I thought I would never be able to find a replacement for Ten Ren's in NYC. The bubbles here are cooked to perfection and the tea is so delicious! The snacks you can order here are the best! I love the spring rolls & dumplings! The sauce for the dumpling is sooooooo goooooodddd!! mmmmm yummy You should definitely try this place out if you haven't yet!

This place is awesome for some relaxation. It is spacious and quiet. The bubble teas are great the pork dumpling are very tasty too. Great place to go for homework. Staff are friendly and good looking. Very enjoyable experience.

This place got better from when it first opened.  The boba is passable but they still put way too much sugar/syrup in the tea.  The dumplings are pretty good too (especially the sauce that goes w/ them) but a little pricey (6 dumplings for $5ish).

Haven't tried everything on their menu but most of their drinks are powdered drinks.  Doesn't seem to use real natural tea.  Most fruity flavors have a distinct artificial flavor.

My favorite spot for bubble tea. Get the Japanese Green Tea mixed with Taro as a smoothie, best drink ever :D

I tried this place three times now because of the high reviews and I keep thinking, maybe it's their bad day... First of all, they don't have Jasmine Green Milk tea, which is a classic basic green milk tea that every other bubble tea place across the states carries.... Weird.  First time I tried Thai iced tea with bubbles.  Thai iced tea was quite sweet...but still drinkable....but the bubbles were the worst I've tasted... It was hard inside and mushy outside....which means its been chilled then sat outside for over 6 hrs.  Gross.  Second time, I tried taro tea with no extra sugar requested(since it was too sweet last time) with bubbles.  Bubbles were much better! So I guess first time was a bad day.... Taro tea tasted too watered down though.  It wasn't tasty but drinkable.  Third time, I asked for a recommendation.  The server said taro, coconut.  I asked for a less sweetened version since I don't like it too sweet. The server said no problem!  But when I tasted the tea, it was literally the sweetest thing I've ever tasted.  It was literally drinking taro/coconut flavored liquid fructose syrup.  And to add to my disappointment, the bubble had the same consistency as my first visit.  Hard inside, mushy pasty outside....no soft chewy texture you look for in a good boba.  I'll prob never go back again.  Three times and you're out in my book!

If you've never tried bubble tea before, then check this place out.  The people there are friendly and are more than happy to help start you with something you'll like.   The bubble tea comes with tapioca gummies on the bottom that slip up through your straw which I had to get used to. They also have a nice looseleaf tea selection as well as some good asian fare to munch on.  Also has very nice places to sit and talk.

Best bubble tea cafe in Western NY.  They've had a long tenure in the WNY area and were sorely missed when they left.  Upon returning, they picked out a great spot for everyone to drop in and kick back and filled the demand that was much needed in the area.  Everyone who's anybody in BUF knows Tea Leaf and it makes for a great alternative to the no-campus Starbucks for a quick 2pm pick-me-up for worker bees.  They have a dizzying array of syrups to mix your favorite drink, including slushies, and coffees.  The menu changes up every so often to keep things fresh and interesting.

Tea leaf was my first experience of bubble tea, and it left me with a very pleasant experience.  Tea Leaf has the perfect location, right next to AMC theaters, and literally a minute off of UB campus, I"m sure that this place is constantly busy.  It has a wide flexibility in hours with being open until 11pm during the week and 1am on weekends!  It's a great place to escape the Starbucks, Timmy Hoes, and/or Dunkin' that are littered throughout the Buffalo-side.    The deco is pretty modern looking but it also has given some little nooks to have semi-private conversations with.  They had an expansive menu other than just Bubble tea.  Expresso, Iced caps, teas(hot/cold), hot chocolates, small plates, spring rolls, and desserts.  If you got a late night urge and don't want to make the pilgrimage to Weggies, Tea Leaf won't leave you hanging!   Being the semi-health nut that I think I am, I went with the fruit bubble teas, and didn't like their selections, so I did a mix-my-own (with some of their input.)  I went with kiwi, strawberry and yogurt and it was quite good tasting.  I was again pleasantly surprised, and my sisters' enjoyed their milk based bubble teas.  Definitely a place worth checking out.

Yes, it probably is the best bubble tea place in Buffalo. Unfortunately that's not saying much :(

Best Bubble Tea in Buffalo!!!
Great, great, great, cafe. The bubble tea is fantastic, and the food--wow. It's so refreshing to walk into an establishment and know that the staff cares not only about you, but about the quality of your food. The teas, coffees, and bubble teas are almost endless in variety, as are the dumplings and spring rolls to go with them, if you're hungry. I was, and came away very satisfied. The bubble tea takes just a minute or two to prepare, and the food was well worth the wait. If you're in a hurry though, call ahead--they don't kid around when they say "fresh". Dumplings are not put together until you order them (which makes for some of the best dumplings I've ever had). Otherwise, expect a 10 to 15 minute wait. Again, well worth it, and will probably be shortened as staff is added in the fall (summer around UB is a very slow season to start a new venue). All in all, this is a great place to stop on your way to campus for some bubble tea, or after a movie next door at the AMC on Maple Ridge (did I mention that they're open til 11 pm! A rarity for good eats).
oh well i like it coz its the only place i know around UB that sells bubble tea bubble tea fr the commons doesnt count btw~ too bad altho its close to UB north, u still have to go there by car.. booOoo.
Went back again with a friend last weekend because I had a craving. We had an almond bubble tea smoothie, a coconut bubble tea, and the veggie dumplings between us.  Definitely worth it, even though we had to drive all the way from Hamburg / Colden.  More, more, more!
Great, great, great, cafe. The bubble tea is fantastic, and the food--wow. It's so refreshing to walk into an establishment and know that the staff cares not only about you, but about the quality of your food. The teas, coffees, and bubble teas are almost endless in variety, as are the dumplings and spring rolls to go with them, if you're hungry. I was, and came away very satisfied. The bubble tea takes just a minute or two to prepare, and the food was well worth the wait. If you're in a hurry though, call ahead--they don't kid around when they say "fresh". Dumplings are not put together until you order them (which makes for some of the best dumplings I've ever had). Otherwise, expect a 10 to 15 minute wait. Again, well worth it, and will probably be shortened as staff is added in the fall (summer around UB is a very slow season to start a new venue). All in all, this is a great place to stop on your way to campus for some bubble tea, or after a movie next door at the AMC on Maple Ridge (did I mention that they're open til 11 pm!

Being a newbie to the world of bubble tea, I don't have much to compare to the Tea Leaf Cafe, however my experiences thus far have been highly agreeable. One our first trip into the cafe, we all tried out a different flavor; I tried the milk-based honeydew while my companions opted for a fruit based blueberry and a milk based watermelon, all made with green tea. We found the watermelon to be slightly bland, but the blueberry and honeydew were both delicious. After suffering a week or 2 of bubble tea cravings, I finally made my way back with my boyfriend for a late lunch to try some of their handmade dumplings and springrolls. Never satisfied with one or two selections, we ordered the pork and chive dumplings, the shanghainese soup dumplings, scallion pancake,and pork springrolls. Although there was only one man working; taking orders, making drinks, and I would assume preparing our food, our experience was nonetheless a positive one.

decent bubble tea. kind of dark. better for socializing than as a studying coffee house place.

A great alternative to coffee houses! The atmosphere is nice & casual with intimate tables and two groupings of leather sofas and chairs.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  Dumplings and springrolls were tasty and nicely prepared.  I'd never had bubble tea before - will definitely have it again.
