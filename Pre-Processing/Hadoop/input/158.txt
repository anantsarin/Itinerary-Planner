I've been going here since it was Coolie's. I'm a nostalgic person so perhaps my opinion and view of the establishment may be bias but, I love this place. I can't even count how many great nights I had here. Maxwell's is a stable of Rochester night life. It's one of the most reliable, consistent places to go out at. I've heard complaints about the crowd being the same but, isn't that a hallmark of a great bar?? It's a family owned and operated business, literally. Any night you go to maxwell's you're guaranteed to see Bob, his wife and his beautiful daughter WORKING. Unlike most places where the bouncers are young pumped up assholes, maxwell's is staffed with older, mature guys that don't take shit but, don't give any either unless you ask for it. The drinks are reasonably priced and not watered down. The crowd may look rough but, it's mostly comprised of people just looking to dance and have a good time. If you like hip hop clubs I highly reccomend it. Oh I forgot to mention that they serve food.. all night. Tell me that's not dope.
