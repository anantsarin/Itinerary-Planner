And Buffalo again for the food win. I came down for the weekend, and my parents insisted that I had to try the new vegan dishes at the Steer Restaurant. It was definitely worth it, especially the Garbanzo Fries. All of the dishes we had were 'healthy' vegan, which I didn't expect in the pub setting. So, other than the Garbanzo fries, everything was light and fresh and mostly raw. Definitely good flavors, and you HAVE to try the tofu cheesecake. Seriously good. Next time I come back, I'm going to grab a beer as well! If you are a veg with meat friends, put this restaurant on your list of places to go.
My only visit to the Steer was when I came here right after I turned 21, and back then I didn't really feel the need to come back since it was very much a gross college dive bar. Several years have gone by now and it looks like the owner has made some nice changes since then. It looks clean, is much more open, and there were families with kids eating in the dining room. (Once UB is back in session, I will avoid this place for late nights.) Their new menu caters to vegans and vegetarians now, with more than just one or two options. I went with the Napa Valley burger, with a house-made veggie burger, griddled goat cheese, tomato, and baby basil. It was very good. The fries that came with it were also pretty good - they tasted like potatoes instead of a fryer. My friend had the crabless crab cakes and garbanzo fries. I tasted both and I would definitely come back to order the garbanzo fries with a beer or two. Like a falafel in stick form but not nearly as dense, very good. The draft beer list is decent, but nothing to write home about since most places are jumping on the craft beer bandwagon. Always nice to be able to have the option of local brews on tap - went with the trusty Rusty Chain.

Loved the house salad and taco carne, very fresh

Heard that the Steer had a new vegetarian menu and it did not disappoint! Lots of options, I settled with the black bean burger and the garbanzo fries.  Both were great and full of flavor! The garbanzo fries are not your typical fries, however. They resemble something like a french toast stick instead! Well done, Steer!

I came here because I heard about the new vegan menu. I was not disappointed. In fact, it exceeded expectations. The garbanzo fries were light, crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. The crabless cakes brought back memories of South Florida. Kudos to the owners for being innovative and welcoming to their vegan patrons.

Wow, The Steer has changed. Having not been there since circa my 21st bday, I was super surprised to see The Buffalo News mention them as having a vegan menu. My  best friend and I checked it out today.The vegan options are great. We tried the garbanzo fries which were super crispy. Very impressed. She had the quinoa meatballs dish with zucchini noodles. We both loved it. The sauce was creamy delicious. I had the  marathon bowl which was really different. Kale on the bottom, with lentils, quinoa and pine nuts piled up, topped with miso tofu. I highly recommend. We will def be back to try everything. Our server girl was great too.

Steer is one of those chameleon restaurants that hosts families and groups and by night it is a rowdy college bar.   For those of you interested in food, they have some of the best french onion soup I've had in a while.  Their brunch is very tasty and offers a wide variety of choices, the only issue is sometimes the bar still smells like Fireball from the night before. For you interested in the nighttime side of things, the Steer offers a huge bar in the middle of the building and a great selection of both beer and liquor.  It usually hosts the UB college crowed, but they're a fun bunch. Overall I would say the Steer has something for everyone, whether you're looking for a good meal at a reasonable price or for a place to let off some steam on a Saturday night.

Nice restaurant by day, "out of control college bar by night". Stay away late night when UB is in session, unless you like crazy packed undergrad madness. With that being said, I feel The Steer gets a bad rep. Granted, Friday/Saturday night from 11-4 it's insane. I have been coming here for years and love their dishes, their service, and especially the quality of their ingredients. I believe their chicken is free range, their beef is grass fed, and meats house cured/made(bacon, sausage, corned beef, Ham, Pork belly). They also have a wide variety (~20+) beers on tap and a full bar. The Steer has it all. You can dine in their surprisingly nice dining room, eat at table by the bar, or just simply eat at the bar. You can come here late night and get trashed with the undergrads or happy hour time with the more adult folk. You can also get brunch on Saturdays and Sundays with an option for bottomless Mimosas/ Bloody Mary's for 15$ which is great as well. Give this place a try, you will definitely be surprised at the food

I wasn't exactly sure what to expect when being asked if I wanted to meet up for lunch at the Steer. I had just eaten at lake effect diner and had a great experience so figured the same owner would deliver similar results. When I first walked in, the bar is what caught my eye. It was huge! I'm assuming very accommodating to the college crowd that reside in the area. I really liked the western-y feel and the decorations of bull skulls and bones added to the flair. I felt warm and cozy immediately and was really impressed with the fireplace upon entering the dining room. It definitely had a sort of ski-chalet feel to it. While looking over the menus I was really happy to see so many different choices of burgers, flatbread pizzas and sandwiches. I was especially interested in the "Elvis Bad Ass Burger" which boasts peanut butter, bacon, banana, honey, and american cheese but didn't know if I would be able to actually stomach it (I was on my lunch break with half a days work left!) I would however be willing to give it a shot someday-two thumbs up for the creativity! My lunch consisted of two flatbread pizzas, (split two ways)-one with steak, blue cheese and spinach and the other a southwest with grilled chicken, smoked bacon, cheddar and a BBQ black bean sauce. Both were equally yummy although I liked the steak one more (steak was cooked perfectly!!) Only gripe I had came with the salad I ordered afterwards. It was a griddled goat cheese and roasted beet salad with cranberry vinaigrette. I ordered the salad without carrots and croutons simply because they just didn't seem to fit into the dynamic of the salad. When I got the salad, I immediately noticed there were no beets in it and the dressing tasted way more like balsamic. The waiter explained that they had indeed replaced the cranberry with balsamic. I was pretty bummed but decided to order extra dressing anyways. Upon arrival of the dressing the waiter explained that he was mistaken and what I was eating really was the cranberry vinaigrette (ummm..ok?) The griddled goat cheese, however, was amazing. All in all, I really did enjoy my experience here and would recommend to anyone seeking food a little different and funky.

In my previous review, I highly recommended the nachos. They are different every time I go, but they're usually delicious. This time, though, I got the nachos as a take-out item. I opened them up five minutes later to eat them and share with a friend. Instead of real cheese, it was cheese sauce -- the kind you see when you go to a sports game and get nachos in little plastic tubs. I don't remember, honestly, if this was always the case. I really don't think it was -- I'm pretty sure they had real cheese at one point or another, as I find cheese sauce really disgusting. The whole order seemed cheaply made and unfulfilling. For $10, really not worth it --

SMALLEST WINGS IN BUFFALO!  The blue cheese dressing was great , the goat cheese salad was also good and the waitstaff very capable, but 10 tiny wings for a premium price was an embarrassment to me and I disappointment to the out-of-town people I brought with me. The restaurant owner is a provision wholesaler who provides the wings. Can you do any better?

I'm a regular at the bar in the afternoon... I stop in for 2 or 3 drinks and hang out with a few other regulars. I don't normally order the food. Why? The price. $8-$11 for a burger with no sides!!! Not even chips or fries to go with it. Just a burger with a few pickle chips on the side. Way over priced! But, let me say this... When I do order food it is always good.... just stay away from the things like House made Lobster Mac & Cheese and the Ribs... Precooked and reheated. The owners are not idiots, they know it is a college neighborhood and most of their customers are kids from NYC with mom and dad's credit card and these kids just don't care. The cost of living is so much lower here in Buffalo but these parents don't really realize this and they just pay the bill. Great food, nice people, way over-priced! PS. They also own the Lake Effect Diner next door... Same story.. Overpriced but delicious. They own Dug's Dive, too, by the lake. Same thing. 10/19/14... I haven't been there for some time now but I hear that they serve fries with the burgers now. Smart move! (They also added a buck to the price.)

Supposedly this place is owned by the same people who own the Lake Effect Diner, which we love as it is a quality & homemade diner - certainly the best/only of its caliber in Buff. We went in for game 2 of the World Series - they (somewhat reluctantly) turned one of the TVs to the game (apparently hockey took higher precedent...not even Sabres, but ugh, that's Buffalo for you) and they didn't have sound on for the game, which was disappointing, but we made do. Beer was a little pricey with somewhat limited selection (I tend to compare more upscale pubs to MacGregors, which has some of the widest and best selection in Buffalo) - a point of issue more for my BF than for me, since I don't like beer - but unfortunately they're also a Coke establishment, and I'm a Pepsi girl. All that aside, I ordered the Restaurant Week salmon, which came with a delicious ginger/cran chutney, jasmine wild rice pilaf and a great medley of seasonal veggies. And peanut butter pie for dessert, which was incredibly rich but definitely good. It might be the same they serve at Lake Effect. BF got the southern style burger, which he greatly enjoyed (though a la carte sides are always a bit of a let down... A burger ought to come with a side...) and a friend got the fish & chips. Fish batter was maybe a little too browned, not what we expect of fish & chips - but we're biased, having sampled fish & chips all over Ireland & Scotland this summer.   The overall feel of the place is far from divey - love the torches outside, and the kind of weird bathrooms. So it was a little pricey, as Buffalo pubs go, but the food was fresh and homemade and yummy. Our friends live close by, and they are regulars, so I'm sure we'll be back eventually.

The good ole steer.... The best college bar in Buffalo. During the day it's a peaceful atmosphere with great food. They have a chef who cooks up his own recipes and are always mixing up the  menu. The burgers a great, but the clam... Omg the clams are to die for.  Desserts are a little too sweet for my taste. Price is upper middle range... At night. Thursday Friday Saturday ... College students getting hammered. Jammed packed, can barely walk... Great bar tenders. Tuesday night they do flip night ( buy a beer flip a coin... Pick correctly and it's free!) Sundays suck. They play the games but for whatever reason they don't allow the games to have the sound on. Watch the games elsewhere.

My Girlfriend and I showed up before the rest of the party. The place was empty save for a party seated already, and it took the waitress about a minute or so of standing there looking in our direction before she actually acknowledged us. She said "Hi" and my Girlfriend asked if they ate reservations, so as to see if anyone from the party we were waiting for had called ahead (we were there for a birthday thing). The waitress looked at my Girlfriend like she had three heads and then said "I don't think so." You don't think so? You work here! Anyway, we informed her we were waiting on five more. So as is customary, she offered to seat us and take our drink orders while we waited right? No, she grunted and walked off. Great first impression. To make a long story short, the service remained as stellar through out the dinner as it was when we were greeted. It took over an hour and a half to serve us our food and we were one of three parties there. One, as I mentioned earlier, was already there and being served as we were (finally) being seated, and one that came in an hour after us. So why it took over an hour and a half to get out food is beyond me. My Girlfriend and I were not too hungry, so we decided to share some of their pizzas. If you want pizza, this is not the place! The pizzas looked like tiny, slightly burnt flat breads; and they were bland. Completely flavourless. Look, I know this is a bar and all, but come on, at least a dash or oregano. I ordered the Blanco, sounded good. Supposedly it is a ricotta pizza with garlic, spinach and tomatoes. When a pizza is described as having garlic as an actual ingredient, I expect to taste it. My Girlfriend got the special, it was a chicken and avocado pizza. Instead of chicken, it had some bits of chicken that were clearly left next to open fish, and then a bunch of pork. We were going to split the pizzas, but that didn't happen because I can't eat pork. When we asked the waitress to verify what meat was used, she said she'd ask and then we never heard back. For whatever reason our party decided to order coffee after the "meal". So we ended up waiting for the check for another hour because of it. Two and a half hours for bland, overpriced "pizzas", I would have had a better meal at Deny's.

Not impressed. Smells atrocious when you first walk in. Ok if your a college kid, not if your dropping $60 on dinner.   Salad- asked for 2 dressings, assumed they would be on the side when we showed our curiosity. Nope. Both on top. Nasty. App- bacon wrapped shrimp. Over cooked. Dinner- pasta with chicken and prosciutto covered with suspect white sauce. Tasted straight out of a Campbell's can. Overlooked. Chicken was unnoticeable and over processed. Go to the Steer and drink, not eat. Biggest waste of $60 I ever spent.

Yes I'm young, yes I'm in dental school, and I've only been to the Steer twice and only to eat. The burgers are pretty solid - there's nothing wrong with them and there's nothing great about them and certain ones are hall off on Thursdays, which is an awesome deal. The bartender was nice and attentive while keeping all the customers happy. The wings are really good and I don't even like wings. The red chili lime is the way to go  - it was SO frickin good. The wings were crisp and not too saucy. The hot BBQ was ok and didn't taste like either or. Served with a good serving of carrots and celery, which was surprisingly fresh and delicious. The only thing is that a double order of wings was not really that many in it for $17 (maybe 15 or 17?) and I think you have to pay $1 extra for splitting the order to two sauces. So I was splitting the pulled pork sandwich...jeez...please if you ever listen to anything I have to say - PLEASE DO NOT get that sandwich. It looked like baked beans. There was no strings of pork - no pork even showing. It was just brown blob of something on the sandwich. I took a bite and I couldn't get past the texture of baked beans and it didn't taste quite right. Usually, I'd be able to eat something I don't like, but this was bad and we told the bartender and switched out for a burger. That was nice :) but I felt like a butthole. The food was fine - nothing special. Wings were a little expensive. It's a nice place to go hang out after school with some friends.

Love the place. Friendly staff, great beer selection, a warm and welcoming environment, and amazing food!

So there is no way the Steer is getting any less than 5 stars from me. If I could give it 100, I would. As a college student living in Buffalo for four and a half years, the Steer became my second home, so I'm pretty much an expert on the place. The food is nothing less than spectacular. (The burgers and wings have always been my favorite.) Fitting into the category of the "broke college student" for quite some time, I've managed to spend almost 5 years eating and drinking at this place several times a week without going completely bankrupt. The bartenders are very generous with the amount of liquor they pour into mixed drinks, and the prices definitely don't show it. I do have one small complaint.......... BRING BACK THE OLD STEER! They recently built a little lounge in this place which COMPLETELY ruined it. They no longer have space for the pool table that so many of my college memories revolve around...... So sad :( One final note- If you're over 25, don't show up here after 9pm.

I ordered a salad here. The salad contained: - Steak - Sweet potato fries - Crispy onions a la Ted's Hot Dogs - Mayo There were also some salad greens tucked in there. Is this healthy? No. Is this Buffalo? Yes. Will I order it again? Probably not. Will I go back to the Steer for beer? Yep! Also notable: this is the only restaurant I've ever been to where the waitress actually offered to split the check for us before we asked, versus giving us the pained split-check stare (yeah, you know the one). A solid three stars.
I ordered a salad here. The salad contained: - Steak - Sweet potato fries - Crispy onions a la Ted's Hot Dogs - Mayo There were also some salad greens tucked in there. Is this healthy? No. Is this Buffalo? Yes. Will I order it again? Probably not. Will I go back to the Steer for beer? Yep!

I'm a fan of Steer. It's a great place for me and fellow med students to hang out, eat dinner, grab a drink after a grueling day of being pounded with knowledge. The fireplaces are nice and warm. Very cozy. The food comes in rather generous sizes. I've had both the pulled pork sandwich and the burger. I would have to say the burger is one of the better patties I've had in a while. However, the bottom bun was a little soggy when I got it. The chili is great and the pulled pork sandwich is average. The beer selection is pretty good, not extremely extensive, but enough to probably have a decent drink. The waiters are very attentive and very friendly. All in all, its the cozy and friendly atmosphere atmosphere, as well as the solid food that will keep me coming back for more. The place can be a little spendy if you are a student, so expect to splurge a little when you are here.

I actually liked the place and I don't usually like bars. Went there with a friend. The drinks were reasonable of course. The crowd was good the bartenders were nice and patient until other places. The only negative is the mirror!! Damn! People can see everything on the other side of the mirror. I mean why would you want to see a guy/girl playing with their mouth when you're trying to have a good time?!

I used to like the steer.  That was before they remodeled and got all snobby ..... Yeah, it looks and smells much better in here (they must have read my previous review that commented on the wet mop smell) ... but that doesn't entitle them to charge $4-5 for a bottle of domestic beer ($5 for a Bud Light Lime??????).  Their taps were out due to construction ... I can only hope they keep the same selection with reasonable prices. The older gentleman who previously bartended on the nights we went was replaced by a young 20-something blonde.  While friendly, she was not attentive and was more interested in chatting with the guys than serving our group of friends.   The ridiculous prices for crappy beer combined with the bad service caused The Steer to lose out on a group of 10+ girls who were ready to drink for hours.  It's a shame, I will miss this place.

I've always been a somewhat reluctant fan of The Steer. I hate what it turns into on Thursdays and Saturdays (...but I would never ask them to change, because it is the best college bar on Main street in University Heights).  That being said, in the last decade since I left college, I have occasionally been to The Steer for food and a beer. Before the crowd or on the more relaxed nights it is quite a fine bar with a good menu. If you like Coles or Fat Bobs, there is no reason you can't have as much fun at The Steer. I went yesterday evening for dinner at the bar and was very happy with the new menu. It was recently changed, and as is boldly stated, they have pledged to "no longer use preservatives". I'm not sure what that suggests of the prior menu. Furthermore as often as possible the meat and veggies come from local farms. I had two "Steerwiches" - new smaller, cheaper a la carte burger-style sandwiches. (Just for size comparison, they are a little bigger than a standard fast food burger.) I had a grilled chicken sandwich, the Budha burger - a new hand pressed veggie burger, and locally cut fries. All were great. I'd call it mighty fine pub fare. And with the new Sam Adams Spring Ale and a Spaten, the beer selection matched the food.

As the king of the UB/University Heights college bar scene...the stars above say it all.  "Meh.  I've experienced better."  It's where a lot of the fraternities and sororities hang out and have their functions, and that never was my scene, so I suppose that's why I'm soooo unimpressed by it.     Went there for a bar party when I was at the end of my college career at UB and I thought "OK.  It's a bar.  Where's my plastic cup of overpriced crap-ass beer?"   Note:  When I first walked in the place, the downstairs bar stunk of spilled beer, maybe some vomit(?); I was envisioning the swarms of fruit flies buzzing around their patrons heads, divebombing into their pints of draft Blue Light in the warmer months.  Ick. Ick, Ick.

Gotta love the Steer - used to be more of hole in the wall bar frequented by UB students but they remodeled about a year or so ago and now it looks great.  Bartenders there are always nice and chatty and the food is nothing elaborate but pretty good.  For good entertainment, sit by the bathrooms and watch people primp and check for spinach in their teeth in the two-way mirror that they don't realize is a two-way mirror.  Great place to grab a beer and a burger near UB South.

You were my main supplier of alcohol during grad school and if it weren't for you, I wouldn't have made it through. The food is actually not bad here - the burgers are solid and the wings were my favorite in Buffalo.   The bartendars are awesome. It does kind of turn into a fraternity/sorority crowd late night on the weekends but I was also usually sloppy drunk by that time so I did not mind.

Great bar if you are still in college and with a fraternity or sorority, otherwise stay out. Out of the university heights bars it is one of the more "upscale" bars but the others in the area are so bad it is not hard to make this place look good. If you are from out of town and find yourself in this area you should do one of two things. 1. Get out fast 2. Find a hiding place, which can be the Steer.

I remember when I was still underage and had to use my cousins Id to get into this place only to find myself among abunch of frat guys drinking themselves stupid!!! Great place if you're 19 and under or if your maturity level is that of a 16 year old...

This place is a college bar through and through at night and a decent eating establishment during the day and early evening. If you're in college or have some weird thing for college girls/guys and are over 25 then I guess this is music to your ears as well during those late evenings! I haven't been here in years but some nights were good, other nights were horrible. It's the way of the college bar. A lot think it is just a college bar though, and I hope you believe the others as well as mine when we say that it has more to offer with good food, service, and prices. They serve a purpose to the community on a few different levels :)

This is my fav place in Buffalo.  First off they have Sam Adams Cherry wheat ale which is become my fav beer (they introduced me to it) and secondly they have the best burgers in Buffalo.  Prices are right and  atmosphere is cool.  Definitely a college hangout (latenight on weekends) but the seperate dining area is great for a date or family dinner.  Did I mention the outdoor area? they have flaming torches!  Awesome. Try it out next time you're in Buffalo.

They remodeled and it looks and smells nice. Always full of dental school students from nearby UB.  Good place to hang out and grab a "beer at the Steer."
I was pleasantly surprised when I went here for dinner and drinks for a Sabres game.  I live closeby but never thought to go here because I assumed it was a divey college place.  While that may be somewaht true, the vibe and food was nothing what I expected. The food was so reasonable and really good!  I split a ghost pepper sauce flatbread as an appetizer (it was hot but not as hot as they made it out to be).  I got the chicken tacos for dinner and they were delicious!  Everyone at the table was pleased with the food.  Very laid back place and reasonable. $2.00 rolling rocks all the time.

Used to tend bar here in the 80's and was happy to see it still here on a recent run through Buffalo.  Worked w/Bill Nixon for the Turgeon Bros...great crowd...then and now.  Had the wings which were still outstanding...steaks were good as well.  Just a great place to enjoy an ice cold beer, some terrific finger foods...and bs w/the barkeep.  Best to all...JD

Was a nice place with a relaxed atmosphere. Only thing I didn't like was it seemed like the bathrooms (by the bar) were very run down. And maybe I was the only one who noticed, but there is an odd smell to the place. Kind of musty... It wouldn't stop me From going again, but both those negatives cost a star.

Good place for a burger/beer and to just kick back in any of their outdoor patios.  Also good for a sloppy time on weekends when the college kids come out.
Excellent restaurant bar.  Nice atmosphere, good music and great food.  Highly recommended.  Don't confuse the current state of the restaurant with the college dive it used to be from other reviewers reminiscing about they're college years.  This is a nice place.

Lobster Risotto was fab!!!

Blown away like a tumble weed in the desert! I have been to the steer all my life mainly on the weekends to indulge in some drinking however coming here for lunch made me think. This place isn't half bad. The food was good and my feet didn't stick to the ground since it was a mere 1pm. I had the Memphis burger which was delicious! BBQ, cheddar cheese, and coleslaw all on a huge bun!! Very filling. Also a blue moon which my only complaint would be is if it was colder but that just means drinking it down faster ? Will totally come back for lunch again. And would love to come for a Sunday brunch and possible stay for a Sunday funday bills game, with bottomless mimosa win or lose you can't go wrong right?

I will admit, on the weekends it can get pretty rowdy at night! But, Sunday morning brunch is the BEST on Main! I've brought my  family here and they loved it. This is my "hangover fixer-upper go-to-spot!" Jah feel Bomb food for dinner also.

And Buffalo again for the food win. I came down for the weekend, and my parents insisted that I had to try the new vegan dishes at the Steer Restaurant. It was definitely worth it, especially the Garbanzo Fries. All of the dishes we had were 'healthy' vegan, which I didn't expect in the pub setting. So, other than the Garbanzo fries, everything was light and fresh and mostly raw. Definitely good flavors, and you HAVE to try the tofu cheesecake. Seriously good. Next time I come back, I'm going to grab a beer as well! If you are a veg with meat friends, put this restaurant on your list of places to go.
