Prospect Park is truly a gem. The park itself is quite huge, with space and sights for everybody. Enough room for large picnics, group get-togethers or just a day at the park. There's also plenty to do. Lots of places to walk around, beautiful vistas of downtown Troy (and, if you have good eyesight, Albany), playground equipment, and tennis courts. There's also a pool but every time I've seen it it has looked decrepit and unused.
It is my own fault for the removal of a star.  I love Prospect Park itself (drug dealers, day drinkers, mackers, and all).  However, I made the rookie mistake of using the bathroom.  I can deal with gross bathrooms; I was a frequent traveler on the NYS Thruway in the 1980s when they were redoing the rest-stops....its was horrible and using the water to wash your hands wasn't recommended.  BUT when you flush a toilet and the water shoots out of the toilet I have to draw a hard line....THAT WAS FRIGGIN NASTY!  Eww. Eww. Eww.  (and it is all the toilets, not just one...yes i tested them all)
I'm lucky enough to live mere blocks from this beautiful park. Open green space, tennis courts, a spectacular over look view of both the city of Troy and south along the Hudson. Definitely worth checking out at least once.
