This is one of the most romantic spots in Ithaca. Excellent for a first date (I am living proof...I am marrying the man who took me here for our first date while I was an undergrad). The wine flights are enjoyable, and each "taste" is of adequate size and quality. Their flavor sensibility is quite good. I always try to stop here on visits back to Ithaca. They also have a cute outdoor seating area, which is wonderful on the (rare) occasion that the weather is nice in Ithaca.
Just a Taste is my favorite restaurant in Ithaca.  There's just enough variety for me to feel comfortable eating there as a vegetarian, and my meat-eating friends enjoy it too.  The wine selection is fantastic and ever-changing.  The service is excellent.
A friend introduced me to this restaurant and I loved every bit of it.  The selection of tapas was good, and made you want to try every single one of them.  We had the focaccia with roast garlic (yummy), and some other dishes that I can't remember the names of--only that they were amazingly good, and quick to arrive at our table!  The service was very friendly and prompt, without being annoyingly so.
This is the best restaurant in Ithaca. Either get there early or put your name down and stroll the Commons while you wait for a table. Just A Taste is best enjoyed with a group of 3-4 as you will want to try as many things as you can. (they all look good!) The homemade focaccia is mad good, dawg. Warm brie with crostini and melon is sinfully delicious, especially with some nice wine. If you like wings, like I do, they normally have these delicious thai wings that have a little kick although the menu changes everyday. I go here a handful of times a year, and money should not be an issue if you plan on eating here. Go big or go to Moe's.
Stopped for a wine flight with desert. This resturant is unique in that they have several wine flights to choose from. You can literly taste every wine region from Napa Valley to Tuscany,  and don't forget the Finger Lakes. The desert was quite nice.
I'm really having a hard time understanding why everyone is raving about just a taste. I found the menu to be boring and uninspired. Just a taste is a substandard tapas place. Albeit the interior was nice, but that was completely overshadowed by uncreative dishes and slow service. I would NOT recommend just a taste. In my humble opinion it's not the fantastic tapas restaurant everyone claims it to be.
I heard this was supposed to be one of the best places in Ithaca. I found the food to be only slightly above average in quality overall but not exactly anything to rave about. The small portions and disproportionate prices don't help. We ordered seven plates. A good thing about this place is that it has a lot of variety. Many of the items aren't really ideal for sharing though. Some items, like the duck leg or the salmon, are single pieces which you have to cut up, when the original single piece is already too small for one person. Out of the items we had, I would recommend the roast potatoes and the chicken wings because those are actually easy to share and because they tasted better than the others. For the duck leg, I only found the skin to be good, and the meat itself just tasted like the soup it was in and was the most difficult to share because, well, it's a duck leg. The other items (pork loin, spicy shrimp, salmon, sausage) were not memorable at all. Service here could be a lot better. It takes forever to get the attention of any of the wait staff, and when you finally do, they tell you to wait five minutes for them to tell someone else to help you. And they're not very friendly with you when you first walk in to get a table either. I wouldn't recommend this place for groups bigger than four people, not just because you'll have to wait forever for a table, but because this place is tiny and you'll always feel cramped. And even if you have a small group, prepare to spend a lot of money just to feel full. The setting and the lighting of the restaurant is nice but since every table is talking loudly in close proximity, it gets pretty noisy. We had trouble talking to each other at our table because we couldn't hear each other through all the other discussions in the room.
Everything I ate here was excellent. In particular, the focaccia, lamb skewers and homemade Italian sausage are well worth your time. For a tapas place, the portions were quite generous. There is also a nice selection of wine available in taste sizes and by the glass.
SO tasty! I love it when I am in a restaurant and I'm already planning 3 more visits so I can justice to the menu! We went as two people and ordered 4 tapas. The selection of wine flights is wide and really good. Go with the local flight if you're a first timer, you can't go wrong with local in Ithaca! If you're a vegetarian, definitely get the brussel sprouts and the roast new potatoes, they're both cooked to perfection! All in all, delicious food, delicious wine and excellent service! It's on it's way to become my favorite restaurant in Ithaca!
I think it's the best restaurant in Ithaca.  It is a lovely place to eat with friends, family or go on a date.  JAT has a very warm, friendly atmosphere.  They don't take reservations which is something of a double edged sword.  If you time it right (early in the night) I'd say you can always get in, otherwise it will be a long wait. The food and wine changes seasonally, mostly - they always have some items like the famous Deep Fried Potato wedges, which are a must have.  My favorite item is in the winter - "Brussel Sprouts Sauted in Brown Butter with Garlic, Pecans and Romano Cheese".  I didn't realize how great brussel sprouts can be until I had this. They have outdoor dining in the back in the summer.  It's a nice shaded patio with a fence around it, really nice in the summer except maybe when it is cool. They used to have a brunch, long ago.  I've seen it come and go twice.  If it reappears, go!  It will make any weekend morning wonderful.
Had a great meal for four here that did not break the bank. I can understand why this is such a hit for locals: the food is tasty and inexpensive, and the ambience is bustling and fun. I loved the chipotle aioli fries (do yourself a favor and get an order per 2 people), and the ceviche.  The service was quick and just the right amount of attentive: we appreciated not getting interrupted a lot as we caught up.  And the desserts were phenomenal, which was a nice surprise - especially the banana bread cake with burnt caramel.  I definitely look forward to coming here again on future trips to Ithaca!
best overall restaurant in Ithaca not fancy or pretentious at all, just really tasty and well prepared food great place for foodies since you get to try all sorts of dishes if you wish the wait can be a little long, but they will call you once your table is ready the tapas philosophy is properly executed, although not really Spanish in flavor and menu must try: - braised duck - cod fish fritters - braised pork - focaccia bread i am sure there are other extremely delicious menu items, maybe next time if you are visiting Ithaca, this place is a must. relatively moderate prices and WINE FLIGHTS! seriously, if you appreciate culinary diversity .. this is the place for you!
Arrived at 7:00 on a Saturday night and was told that the wait (for a group of three) would be 45 minutes, which I thought was reasonable considering that the restaurant is located "down town" and that it was a Saturday night. However, we ended up waiting 1 hour and 20  minutes!! Absurd. Another con is that the inside of the restaurant is VERY small. My seat was actually touching the seat at another table. The food was pretty good and arrived very promptly, but was not worth the wait.
This place is wonderful and has some of the best food I've ever had in any restaurant. I was extremely surprised to find a restaurant with such good food in a small city like Ithaca. Make sure you order their foccacia bread with their roasted garlic, which is out of this world. The pricing is definitely fair and the service is pretty good. The only negative about this place is that it is very very small so getting a table is usually very hard. I would suggest you call ahead or go there and plan on walking around the commons for at least 45 minutes.
This place is the best. It's a good deal, delicious, and lots of great food in season. Also, that one waiter guy is my favorite waiter of all time. He is amazing.
Great little spot!
Maybe I'm comparing this to Spanish tapa places I have been to before or maybe it was the fact that there was SUCH a hype to try this place, but I was less than satisfied. I came here with a group of about 6. I was a bit disappointed to see that the tapas weren't portioned. You had to physically tear apart a piece of chicken off the bone in order to share it. Most places I have been to portion out the tapas for easier sharing. I also wish the waitress would have recommended for us to get 2 of the smaller dishes for easier sharing. At the end of ordering about 10 different things, we were all still hungry. Waitress suggested potatoes (which we had already eaten) so we got another order. It's sad to me when in order to fill up on a $20 meal, you have to eat potatoes I feel bad giving a lower review since most people seem to like it so much but it just wasn't for me..
The only reason I did not give this place 5 stars was because it is pretty cramped seating. Other than that, the food was phenomenal. I took my fiance here for his birthday celebration. The only thing we really didn't care for was the pork. Everything else-the asparagus, cauliflower, strip steak, and a few others, were so delicious. We ordered 5 tapas and that was a perfect amount. I wish we would have tried this place earlier in my trip, I would have come back! Maybe next time.
We were a group of 7 and it is perfect for tapas.  We ordered half of the menu and all came out good.  Out of all I love the simple roasted new potatoes, believe it or not.  The spicy black bean soup was also excellent.  My favorite ones also include the duck leg, lamb belly and wine tasting "flight".
I love that whole idea of getting a bunch of small portions of different foods and sharing them with friends at the table. The selection included your typical tapas dishes with a good number of original ones as well. It's an ever changing menu as any good restaurant will do. If you're adventurous or just love good and different foods don't pass this place by.
Great place to sit outside and have a small plate or two or three. The menu changes daily and the food is fresh and tasty. Reasonably priced and attentive friendly service in Ithaca. I had the spaghetti Squash, the English cheese, and the Potato pie. Nice presentations and well flavored.
Just a Taste is my favorite restaurant in Ithaca.  There's just enough variety for me to feel comfortable eating there as a vegetarian, and my meat-eating friends enjoy it too.  The wine selection is fantastic and ever-changing.  The service is excellent.
I only come here with best friends and special reasons - roommate reunions, farewell parties, birthday parties. Because this is a so pleasant place and food is so delicate and delicious.
They may not serve authentic Spanish tapas, but the food sure is tastey. Go early or make a reservation (do they take them?), they tend to be quite crowded.
I absolutely loved Just a Taste. The brussels sprouts and the lemon chicken with Thai barbecue were the shining stars of the meal, but even our least favorite dishes were nowhere close to bad. Add to that a flight of wine, and you're in for a great experience. The only problem was the small size of the dining room, which I'm finding is a trend in a lot of Ithaca restaurants. We ended up sitting at the bar, which wasn't a problem with just two of us. Highly recommended.

The food is good, but the service is terrible. I am never going back. There is a server who is extremely sassy and rude. For example, he spilled water on a customer next to me on one occasion, and never bothered to apologize. He also ignores customers when they are requesting for something, and does not acknowledge their presence at all. The wait is always atrociously long, and the atmosphere too crowded. Although it is "tapas," I have been to Spain and this stuff does NOT compare. Don't go, because the food, the wait, and the rudeness are not worth it.
Pretty average... serving size is a little large for tapas, but the prices are good. Great selection of vegetarian offerings. Seating arrangement is very awkward at some spots in the restaurant. Service is fast, but two of the three things I ordered appear to have been microwaved.
Just A Taste is one of the best dinner spots in Ithaca. I've tried everything from focaccia to duck at this tapas-style restaurant, and every meal has been creatively prepared and delicious. The wine flights are excellent, too. Be sure to take advantage of the restaurant's outdoor seating during the summer months. Bring a few friends and try a variety of items - you really can't miss! FYI: Expect to wait for a table; this place gets very crowded.
Everything I ate here was excellent. In particular, the focaccia, lamb skewers and homemade Italian sausage are well worth your time. For a tapas place, the portions were quite generous. There is also a nice selection of wine available in taste sizes and by the glass.
Amazing, classy place. Great vibes and even better food. One of the best restaurants in Ithaca.
So much better than I was expecting!
Tapas for one! I flew into Ithaca for business and the yelp reviews for this spot piqued me interest. This place is small, quaint, and delicious. The service is certainly good, but nothing to rave about. If you are solo dining let me help you out cause this menu is vast. The braised duck leg is delicious and perfect for one. I really would hate the logistics of sharing it. It's braised in wine, Chinese vinegar, pumpkin, and other spices. I also got the summer squash with pecans. That was also a winner. My only annoyance was the squash came out 10-15 mins before the duck. Last I had the apple-plum crisp with whipped cream. Let me whip my southern out with a big, long "Y'all". As in "Y'all need to go!  It was my favorite dish and the perfect balance of sweet and tart. It just gave me all the emotions. If you are solo dining I'd avoid the soups and salads. Those servings are large enough for 2 or 3 and will totally prevent sampling.

This is an Ithaca hotspot, apparently. Tapas and wine. Yeah that's what it's all about. Everything from flatbread to roasted potatoes to Brussels sprouts. Nice room with friendly, helpful service and an extensive wine selection, including multiple flights. I chose one that included a German Riesling that was so unusual I'll have to talk more about that later. I thought the price for four including the wine was a great value. Highly recommended.
Recent visits have just not lived up to expectations.  The prices are not justified based on food quality. "roasted garlic" arrived congealed as if it was slightly warmed up, but had been cooked on a previous day.  Barely edible, really, and just not something I'd want to pay for anywhere. Gazpacho is more like watery cheap salsa without any herbs or other expected flavors.  This was like "Pace" salsa watered down -- and I would never even eat that "Pace" as a salsa!  That is really well below par for gazpacho. Other items were just 'meh' -- even the wine that I ordered was just so mediocre, but the price was $11.25 (for a barely 5 ounce pour -- it looked smaller than most standard glasses of wine, but it may be within standard)
We got a seat on a Saturday night without any reservations. Outdoor seating in the back is very nice. Me and my partner shared the foccacia, chicken wings, sauteed shrimp, and the mushrooms. The portions are large for tapas. I felt like the execution of the dishes fell flat for me. The preparation was almost too simple?  I've been to several tapas places before in other cities, and I think I've experienced better so that is why I gave it two stars. Needless to say, we did leave satisfied and the bill came out to around 24 dollars (without drinks). Good place for a cheap date.
Great little spot!
A very crowded spot, so get there early. We read all the good reviews & decided to give it a try. It was good, but I don't think it was worth the hour wait. We ordered a lot and initially our waitress thought she could remember off the top of her head. However, half way through the order, she decided a pen and paper would work best. A few dishes we liked were the foccacia, the brie, mussels, clams, pork and chicken wings. A few not worth the try were the tortilla espanola, the rice and shrimp with garlic. Food comes out quick & parking isn't bad, but less of a wait for mediocre food would've been nice.
They don't take reservations and are frequently busy, so you may end up having to wait around 45 minutes.  Generally good for a date, but show up early to put your name in. Sometimes the food is great other times it is ordinary. I generally get the foccacia, a shell fish and some sort of fowl.  Generally dishes are a combination of about 4 ingredients.  The wine flights are lots of fun. The staff can be snooty and the prices are kinda high. Come here to break up the monotony about once a season.
Just moved to Ithaca from Washington, D.C. and I think this is hands down the best restaurant in town. Whereas some other places are "good for Ithaca", Just A Taste could hold up against good restaurants in DC. The small plates make it easy to try lots if throngs, which you will want to do because the menu is so great it's hard to decide what to get! I had white beans with tomatoes and peaches that was delicious and perfect summer fare. I followed with a plate of sausage and eggplant that was also delicious. One drawback: the place is small and popular so you sometimes feel like a sardine. Also while the food and wine are excellent, this is not a fine dining experience. Sometimes you'll have wild kids running around underfoot. On the upside if you eat alone at the bar you'll appreciate the lively vibe. Excellent place!
I love that whole idea of getting a bunch of small portions of different foods and sharing them with friends at the table. The selection included your typical tapas dishes with a good number of original ones as well. It's an ever changing menu as any good restaurant will do. If you're adventurous or just love good and different foods don't pass this place by.
4.5 Stars. 4 for food. 5 for value, service, and experience. Value cannot be beat. Most dishes are quite satisfying, some wonderful, a few just decent but by no means poor (I'm looking at you, sauteed mushrooms). Lines can be long but the wait is worth it. Service and value bring a 4 star review up to 5.
Just a taste is my favorite place to go in Ithaca if I'm dining with 2-3 people. The tapas are amazing so the portions are really big. I would suggest ordering no more than 4-5 tapas for 3 people, around 3 for 2 people. The wine flights are great but can add up in $$, since you're probably going to purchase a flight and then get individual glasses. My favorites are: Warm Brie with Melon and Crostini Russet Potato Wedges with Chipotle Aioli Brussel Sprouts Chicken Wings Pork Loin Skate Wing Shrimp Sauteed with Garlic and Sherry Amazing!
Food is good. Not much to choose from. Loud considering its a small dining area and everyone is so close. Smells like dirty mop water and bleach. Gray-haired male waiter didn't talk much and would just toss plates on our table. It felt like he was angry with us or something. How strange. Enjoy your tiny tip, dude.
They may not serve authentic Spanish tapas, but the food sure is tastey. Go early or make a reservation (do they take them?), they tend to be quite crowded.
Always busy when I walk by so my girlfriend and I decided to give it a try. This was a few months back so I don't remember all the details, but overall I know I enjoyed it. The place has small portions like a tapas bar, though some portions are a bit big. Even so its easy to share and quite satisfying at the end of it all. Wine selection is good, with a large variety of wines offered by the glass. Similarly they have a good selection of beer, many from the finger lakes of course lol. If you are in Ithaca and want to have a semi casual meal with friends or a significant other, this is definitely a place you want to consider.
Very good food. Fun to try different things, great for a date. Would definitely recommend you try it
This place has been built up as being great for 4 years.  Was it great?  Sort of.  I was expecting a more high end atmosphere when I walked in.  They do exist in Ithaca and this is a tapas bar.  I expected some sort of European flair in the decorations and I got white walls with some local art and your basic dining rooms tables and chairs.  Ok.  I can deal with that.  The service was friendly, hovered to take away finished plates (you go through them fast and you don't want them piling up), and worked to make it have a European feel.  And 4-tops that were occupied by 2 people were turned so that you faced the street and could people watch.  Too bad it was raining...  The food.  While I hope it was just the chef, the two meat dishes were over-cooked.  The veggies were perfection.  The veggies on the meat dishes were perfection.  The veggie dishes were perfection.  The take away: avoid meat dishes and don't even consider the fish because if they overcook pork loin and rabbit, there is no way that they are going to cook fish to a 'just done' point.  Or maybe is was the chef. Going back?  Sure, but only with vegetarians.  I don't mind veggie meals but it is something to keep in mind.
Pretty average... serving size is a little large for tapas, but the prices are good. Great selection of vegetarian offerings. Seating arrangement is very awkward at some spots in the restaurant. Service is fast, but two of the three things I ordered appear to have been microwaved.
Every day, beginning at 5pm, a sizable crowd can be found milling just outside this place, waiting for its doors to open at 5:30. There's a reason - Just a Taste is far and away the best restaurant I've been to in Ithaca and maybe the best value tapas place I've been to anywhere, and failing to meet or beat this crowd means an hour(s) long wait. Unless you're dying of hunger, in which case there are half a dozen other restaurants on the same block, it's worth it. In fact, Just a Taste's employees could gratuitously insult me throughout the course of an entire meal and I'd be okay with it, as long as they maintained their excellent standards for food, extensive wine list and surprisingly affordable prices. In summer, there's the added benefit of a nicely-lit outdoor patio out back. Tempted as I am to subtract a star for the inevitable wait, that's not Just a Taste's fault for being so wonderful. That said, it wouldn't hurt to have one or two other wine bars in downtown Ithaca, at least to take the pressure off this place for those who would prefer Finger Lakes viticulture at the center of their culinary experience; the fact that Just a Taste is also the downtown establishment that comes closest to a traditional wine bar probably makes the crowding worse than it would otherwise be.
We went here on a Saturday night, despite the reviews citing waits of over an hour. It was mobbed, with people spilling out the door. The woman took our name and phone number and we were free to wander, shop, or have a drink nearby, and in 45 minutes we were called, and our table was waiting. Service was prompt and pleasant.  I know there were a lot of complaints about the service, but quite honestly, the place was so busy and loud, it was not conducive to small talk.  I thought the staff were pleasant and efficient, and our water glasses were always filled. The food was amazing, and I thought reasonably priced.   We had the Brussels sprouts  ( probably our most favorite of the night), greens, baked Brie, spicy shrimp, flank steak, and pork tenderloin. We were stuffed, and the bill was just over $50, and that was with one beer. We opted out of the wine flight, as we had gotten "wined out" on the wine trail earlier in the day, but the choices looked great and also fairly priced. The reason for 4 not 5 stars was the noise level, which was ridiculously overwhelming, to the point that we finally stopped trying to converse during dinner.  There happened to be a group at a table in the center of the room who were especially loud, and once they left, it was slightly more tolerable.  But it is a very small space, with a very happy vibe! And the food was worth the wait!
This is my favorite restaurant in Ithaca. Great quality food at reasonable prices. The dishes are both interesting and delicious!
So much better than I was expecting!
We ate too many dishes to talk about but the bottom line is that they all come to the table in a timely fashion and they are either appropriately hot or cold depending. Every dish is fantastic. I've been here twice. Once 2 years ago and again tonight and I can honestly say that this restaurant has not changed. Every dish is presented well and is flavorful and as described on the menu. Service is swift and attentive. Flights of wine are always good too. Dessert is equally well done. There is absolutely nothing to complain about.
Wow, food was amazing.  This is a tapas-style restaurant with small but delicious portions of a variety of dishes.  Keep in mind, a full meal for a single person can be made of 2 to 4 dishes so prices can get pretty expensive.  With that said, if you begin with some of the more filling dishes like bread or potatoes, there is no reason you should spend too much.  There was a wide variety of wines and a smaller selection of beer.  Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Ithaca.  A great place for a date or to bring your parents.
This is a restaurant with a discerning difference in its format. Like the name, it implies a minute taste of something-hopefully-spectacular. So yes,  this was a bit like a tapas joint in which 'apps' and 'entrees' were thrown out the window. Set on a round table, my sister, brother, his gf, and I perused the menu in earnest for a fulfilling dinner. We ordered sangrias and when they arrived, we were really quite pleased. They were amazing! Fruity with a hint of alcohol, it was almost like a juice box to me. Note to self: Dangerous! bit.ly/1cRR3AT My brother kept trying to take large sips but my wary glares of 'Mine!' eventually backed him off. 5/5 As a replacement app, we ordered melty brie and crostini. Hmm, a pretty sloppy presentation but the brie was gooey and rich, complementing the sweet, ripened slices of melon. Using the crostini as crunchy vehicles were a delight! :D bit.ly/14ReW6t 5/5 For entrees, my sister and I shared a pan of spicy shrimp sautéed with tomato, onions, lime, and cilantro. This was one of the better ceviches I've had. Perfectly cooked shrimp swimming in a flavorful soup with a kick. This was light and refreshing albeit a tiny portion. bit.ly/13pN7nN 4/5 As for my brother and his gf, they shared a piping hot lamb and rice dish. They enjoyed it but I had 'just a taste' (harhar) and it was a tad salty for my liking. This too was an ill and meager replacement as an entree. bit.ly/1dcEr5P 2/5 Still ravenous, we ordered a side of white and portabella mushrooms sauteed in butter with garlic and thyme. I demolished this tiny bowl by myself. I loved it! Mushrooms were tender and that buttery, rich sauce was like crack. bit.ly/144l1wQ 5/5 Yummy!! I wish there was more!! bit.ly/1aaWOZd Overall, the prices were quite fair. If we split the tab, we would have equally paid approximately twelve dollars but my older sister paid for everything. A really lovely meal but we still left wanting more food. And that was when we spotted Jimmy John's next door...
Recent visits have just not lived up to expectations.  The prices are not justified based on food quality. "roasted garlic" arrived congealed as if it was slightly warmed up, but had been cooked on a previous day.  Barely edible, really, and just not something I'd want to pay for anywhere.

Other items were just 'meh' -- even the wine that I ordered was just so mediocre, but the price was $11.25 (for a barely 5 ounce pour -- it looked smaller than most standard glasses of wine, but it may be within standard)
I've been to this place for multiple birthdays, dates, etc over the years, and it's a perfect place for everything and all age ranges. The back patio is lovely. Service is consistently attentive and efficient. Not a 5 star, because sometimes dishes are not as warm/hot as they should be. Great variety of wines. On a weekend night, there's often a long wait.
Although this place is small it's worth it.  The tapas are delicious especially the Brussels sprouts.  I didn't get to try it but I liked how they offered wine tastings and a local wine flight.
We moved to Ithaca in the fall of 2013 and heard that this was the hot spot downtown! We live in Fall Creek, only a short 5 blocks away so we certainly had to give this place a try. I think in hindsight we had pretty high expectations for some NYC quality tapas, but the place is very nice. When the weather is nice they have an absolutely beautiful patio in the back, so it opens up quite a bit of space. However, in the late rainy fall when we went in it was quite packed and took us over 35 minutes to get a table. Although it seems on the weekends that is pretty standard for this block of downtown pizzaz. We decided to wait for our table at the bar, and I got a wine flight which was amazing and really reasonably priced. The wine was delicious and we got a little appetizer to pass the time. When we did get our table we ordered a few dishes to share and they were fairly reasonably priced but some of them seemed either too small for what they cost or too simple. I had expected something more up to the slow food/farm-to-table standards for their prices. I think this would be a great place for two couples or a group to share a lot of things, although some of the plates are quite small. As far as vegetarian fare, it can be a little limited, and even more so with vegan. When we went the service was pretty good and the menu is quite long with several very inexpensive items and several very expensive items for everyone's price range.
They don't take reservations and are frequently busy, so you may end up having to wait around 45 minutes.  Generally good for a date, but show up early to put your name in. Sometimes the food is great other times it is ordinary.

The staff can be snooty and the prices are kinda high. Come here to break up the monotony about once a season.
Came here for our first meal in Ithaca and we were not disappointed! Food was quite delicious and their wings were my favorite item on the menu. They had a nice sweet and spicy coconut flavor to them and I really need to learn how to recreate that dish at home. The stuffed squash blossoms were also fried to perfection and still retained the delicateness of the dish. The spicy shrimp saute was also nice, but were not as good as the other two items. After those tapas, we shared an entree of the tenderloin, which my husband loved, but I found quite plain. Overall though, it was a lovely experience and the service was decent. I would definitely recommend.
We could not get in. Not because the line was so long- we anticipated that from all the reviews- but because their annual Beaujolais festival precluded any regular dining. Check to make sure the restaurant is open for regular business before planning on arriving early to celebrate your brother's 50th birthday! OY!
Big tapas, if you're into it. Hint: I'm into it. Went here with my lady companion and got 5 or 6 dishes. Russet wedges, scallops, ceviche, spring mix salad, and gazpacho and maybe something else that I'm forgetting. Everything was delicious. Seriously, couldn't go wrong with any of those choices. Also, they're a little more generous than most tapas places I've been, in that each plates takes more than a couple bites to finish. Perhaps my big city livin' has shaded my expectations. Outdoor seating here is wonderful. The indoor has a nice atmosphere as well. If you're in Ithaca and you'd like a nice dinner, definitely come here.
Just a taste is my favorite place to go in Ithaca if I'm dining with 2-3 people. The tapas are amazing so the portions are really big. I would suggest ordering no more than 4-5 tapas for 3 people, around 3 for 2 people. The wine flights are great but can add up in $$, since you're probably going to purchase a flight and then get individual glasses. My favorites are: Warm Brie with Melon and Crostini Russet Potato Wedges with Chipotle Aioli Brussel Sprouts Chicken Wings Pork Loin Skate Wing Shrimp Sauteed with Garlic and Sherry Amazing!
Stopped for a wine flight with desert. This resturant is unique in that they have several wine flights to choose from. You can literly taste every wine region from Napa Valley to Tuscany,  and don't forget the Finger Lakes. The desert was quite nice.
I liked this place even if it was a bit grimy. The food was dependable, which was good and bad. Good because I knew it would taste good. But I wish they would have changed the menu more so I could taste other things. Also, service can be a miss sometimes. It's probably due to the busyness during peak hours.
The food ranges from great to just ok, depending on what you order. I can't help but feel like they would benefit from reducing the quantity and increasing the quality of options on the menu. The service, unfortunately, is even less consistent. The first time I went here our waitress was super friendly. This most recent visit, not so much. Both times, empty serving plates were not cleared until they had already begun to pile up, and the staff never replace the plates you eat off, which is a shame because by the third or fourth menu item, you run into some serious flavor contamination. All in all, this is a fine restaurant that could be great if they tightened up their game.
Very good food. Fun to try different things, great for a date. Would definitely recommend you try it
I heard this was supposed to be one of the best places in Ithaca. I found the food to be only slightly above average in quality overall but not exactly anything to rave about. The small portions and disproportionate prices don't help. We ordered seven plates. A good thing about this place is that it has a lot of variety. Many of the items aren't really ideal for sharing though. Some items, like the duck leg or the salmon, are single pieces which you have to cut up, when the original single piece is already too small for one person. Out of the items we had, I would recommend the roast potatoes and the chicken wings because those are actually easy to share and because they tasted better than the others. For the duck leg, I only found the skin to be good, and the meat itself just tasted like the soup it was in and was the most difficult to share because, well, it's a duck leg. The other items (pork loin, spicy shrimp, salmon, sausage) were not memorable at all. Service here could be a lot better. It takes forever to get the attention of any of the wait staff, and when you finally do, they tell you to wait five minutes for them to tell someone else to help you. And they're not very friendly with you when you first walk in to get a table either. I wouldn't recommend this place for groups bigger than four people, not just because you'll have to wait forever for a table, but because this place is tiny and you'll always feel cramped. And even if you have a small group, prepare to spend a lot of money just to feel full. The setting and the lighting of the restaurant is nice but since every table is talking loudly in close proximity, it gets pretty noisy. We had trouble talking to each other at our table because we couldn't hear each other through all the other discussions in the room.
Food was pretty damn good !!! Me and the wife went for dinner and since it was are first time at a tapas place we tried a lot of different things. The wings are definitely the best in new York state if not the USA !!!!!! Try them !
Dec 11, 13 Thanks for my Dutch friend Kenny who recommending this tapa eatery to me. Warm Brie with Apple and Crostini          Heartily I wonder why somebody recommended this in his yelp review. Melted cheese, sliced apple, sliced dry bread and THAT IS ALL. Piled on a tatty plate. Can't I make this at home within 1 minute and $2? You can get everything in Wegmans. But except that one dish above, Just a Taste is excellent, for a date, a gathering with friends, or a happily enjoyable solitary repast. Amiable servant, nostalgic ambiance (look at those vintage radios above the bar!). I'm glad that they have a coat rack. Spicy Shrimp Saute with Garlic, Jalapeño, Onions, Lime and Cilantro         Shrimps were really enriched by the collocation of spice. Grilled Pork Loin         Tender inside and served with Roast Butternut Squash Mash and Mushroom. Spinach Salad with Pears, Walnuts, Feta, Red Onion Deep Fried Salt Cod Fritters with Garlic Aioli and Mixed Greens
We went here on a Saturday night, despite the reviews citing waits of over an hour. It was mobbed, with people spilling out the door. The woman took our name and phone number and we were free to wander, shop, or have a drink nearby, and in 45 minutes we were called, and our table was waiting. Service was prompt and pleasant.  I know there were a lot of complaints about the service, but quite honestly, the place was so busy and loud, it was not conducive to small talk.  I thought the staff were pleasant and efficient, and our water glasses were always filled. The food was amazing, and I thought reasonably priced.   We had the Brussels sprouts  ( probably our most favorite of the night), greens, baked Brie, spicy shrimp, flank steak, and pork tenderloin. We were stuffed, and the bill was just over $50, and that was with one beer. We opted out of the wine flight, as we had gotten "wined out" on the wine trail earlier in the day, but the choices looked great and also fairly priced. The reason for 4 not 5 stars was the noise level, which was ridiculously overwhelming, to the point that we finally stopped trying to converse during dinner.  There happened to be a group at a table in the center of the room who were especially loud, and once they left, it was slightly more tolerable.  But it is a very small space, with a very happy vibe! And the food was worth the wait!
Had a great meal for four here that did not break the bank. I can understand why this is such a hit for locals: the food is tasty and inexpensive, and the ambience is bustling and fun. I loved the chipotle aioli fries (do yourself a favor and get an order per 2 people), and the ceviche.  The service was quick and just the right amount of attentive: we appreciated not getting interrupted a lot as we caught up.  And the desserts were phenomenal, which was a nice surprise - especially the banana bread cake with burnt caramel.  I definitely look forward to coming here again on future trips to Ithaca!
Our meal was decidedly mediocre.  Probably because it was a Monday night, since to all appearances it looks like they have everything necessary to make each dish we had a delight.  Tapas are a wonderful balancing act, and they kept blowing it; resulting in surprisingly flavorless bland results.   Every one fell short, except the clams.  They forgot one, denied they forgot it, rushed it, and delivered it undercooked.  The patio is delightful.  The wine flights are a hoot; and certainly a sufficient reason to drop in.
It took me two years to finally get here. Two friends I respect told me it's their favorite restaurant. I can see why. Incredibly versatile, all delicious, all fresh. We had a tomato caprese salad. Amazing. A Spanish tortolla egg n potato, just right, not too heavy. Gazpacho we would come back for. Only problem: only open evenings and no reservations. But worth the wait.
Wow, food was amazing.  This is a tapas-style restaurant with small but delicious portions of a variety of dishes.  Keep in mind, a full meal for a single person can be made of 2 to 4 dishes so prices can get pretty expensive.  With that said, if you begin with some of the more filling dishes like bread or potatoes, there is no reason you should spend too much.  There was a wide variety of wines and a smaller selection of beer.  Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Ithaca.  A great place for a date or to bring your parents.
This place is the best. It's a good deal, delicious, and lots of great food in season. Also, that one waiter guy is my favorite waiter of all time. He is amazing.
I love this place. I've had 3 wonderful dinners here and it seems each time is better than the previous. The tapas are delicious, varied,  and executed well, though not overly complex or pretentious. The Sangria is great and the best part about this place is the wine flights! For a small price, you can get a themed flight of wine (i.e. 5 types of local wines, or 5 types of chardonnays, etc.). The food is always good here and many dishes are excellent. Definitely try the cod fritters, lamb and shortribs. I've always had good service as well, though you have to keep in mind that this is a tapas place and, like most tapas restaurants, they serve the plates as they are ready, so you don't get all your food at once. Everytime I eat at a tapas restaurant I always think that I'm not going to be full and satisfied with the amount that I have ordered, however I always overestimate the amount of food I need to feel satisfied. The only bad thing about this place is that it;s soooooooooo freakin small. They don't take reservations so on busy weekend nights you'll most likely have to go grab a few drinks at some bars in the area while you wait for  a table, rather than trying to wait in the tiny restaurant.
This is a perfect location for dates. The atmosphere is romantic and the service was wonderful. Choosing which tapas you want to order creates a fun dining experience. The food has always been amazing as well.
Although this place is small it's worth it.  The tapas are delicious especially the Brussels sprouts.  I didn't get to try it but I liked how they offered wine tastings and a local wine flight.
We were a group of 7 and it is perfect for tapas.  We ordered half of the menu and all came out good.  Out of all I love the simple roasted new potatoes, believe it or not.  The spicy black bean soup was also excellent.  My favorite ones also include the duck leg, lamb belly and wine tasting "flight".
What a great spot.  My husband and I had never been however we were given a gift certificate to Just a Taste so we decided to try it out.  We were very impressed!  We each ordered a salad to start, I the Mixed Greens and he the Caesar.  Both were very different but delicious: the Caesar was a creamy dressing with large cuts of romaine topped with cheese and the Mixed Greens was tossed with a balsamic vinegar.  We then ordered 4 tapas dishes, the Warm Brie with Melon and Crostini, Deep Fried Chicken Wings tossed in Sweet and Spicy Chili Sauce and Fresh Basil, Rare Grilled Flank Steak with Housemade Spicy Kim Chee, Flatbread with Manchego Cheese and Roasted Vegetables.  We were so impressed by how attentive the service was in the sense that the dishes literally came out of the kitchen steaming. Our least favorite was the Warm Brie with Melon and Crostini, mainly because compared to the others it just was not that unique or flavorful and there was a very small portion of melon.  The chicken wings were extremely spicy so if that is not your forte I would steer away however as spicy food lovers both my husband and I thought they were delicious.  The steak was also very nice and tender with just the right amount of seasoning.  The flatbread was another "win".  The crust was perfectly crispy and the blend of flavors from the cheeses, vegetables, and spices was delicious.  We will be returning!
First off if you don't get there when they open, your not getting a seat! But don't let that deter you because the wait is well worth it! The food here is not just extraordinary but in my opinion may be the best in Ithaca. The prices are decent as well which one wouldn't expect for a place like this. Personally the Salt Cod Fritters were my wife's favorite as well as myself. They are just amazing and every time we go we have to order 2! The Russet potatoes with the Chipotle Aioli is my second favorite, for something so simple they are fantastic. The wings I ordered were the biggest and meatiest wings I've ever had. Their bread is always baked fresh and is just amazing. I don't think there has ever been something I tried that I did not like. This is consistently my wife's and I date night restaurant and we will continue to go there many more times in the future!
We could not get in. Not because the line was so long- we anticipated that from all the reviews- but because their annual Beaujolais festival precluded any regular dining. Check to make sure the restaurant is open for regular business before planning on arriving early to celebrate your brother's 50th birthday! OY!
I only come here with best friends and special reasons - roommate reunions, farewell parties, birthday parties. Because this is a so pleasant place and food is so delicate and delicious.
Best steak fries and garlic focacia bread!! Will definitely go again whenever around ithaca. Very interesting menu, lots of choices for appetizers and drinks. Recommend this 100%.
Always wonderful food.  Lovely staff.  Great wine list including flights.  Desserts worth a special mention as they are far better than others in town.  As long as you don't mind shared plates this is the place to dine in Ithaca.  Just look out for the wait - no reservations.  Ouch! Favorites include focaccia, braised greens, brussels sprouts, baked brie, russet wedges...stop me before I list the entire menu...
I liked this place even if it was a bit grimy. The food was dependable, which was good and bad. Good because I knew it would taste good. But I wish they would have changed the menu more so I could taste other things. Also, service can be a miss sometimes. It's probably due to the busyness during peak hours.
I've been going to JAT for years.  My husband proposed to me there.  We can always get out of there around $50.00 having eaten at least five tapas dishes, two glasses of wine AND dessert.  Honestly we've never had to wait that long, it does help to get there early.  But even in the dead of winter I've never had to wait longer than the time it takes me to have a glass of wine at the bar.  As for the service, it's never bothered me but I do believe they are their own special,  snarky bunch.  My favorite is the tall guy.  He's been there forever, he's totally a sarcastic bastard but damn if he can't recommend the best glass of wine to go with your meal.  None of them have ever been rude to us and our service has never been lacking.  They just don't have a killer bedside manner which is fine with me.  I don't feel like chatting up the waitstaff when I just want to eat anyway. Our favorites: Foccacia w/ Roasted Garlic and Oli Deep Fried Potato Wedges with Chipotle Aioli Brussels Sprouts Any of their shrimp dishes Any of their pork dishes Chicken Wings If you can sit outside on the patio out back in the summer it's great.  Sure the tables wobble like crazy but it's the perfect amount of shade and you totally forget that you're surrounded by car fumes, noise, drug dealers and annoying college students.
Delicious tapas! Each tapa is out of this world.  It is a bit noisy in the restaurant and its a bit pricey for big eaters, but it is definitely worth the money!
The food is good, but the service is terrible. I am never going back. There is a server who is extremely sassy and rude. For example, he spilled water on a customer next to me on one occasion, and never bothered to apologize. He also ignores customers when they are requesting for something, and does not acknowledge their presence at all. The wait is always atrociously long, and the atmosphere too crowded. Although it is "tapas," I have been to Spain and this stuff does NOT compare. Don't go, because the food, the wait, and the rudeness are not worth it.
Food was pretty damn good !!! Me and the wife went for dinner and since it was are first time at a tapas place we tried a lot of different things. The wings are definitely the best in new York state if not the USA !!!!!! Try them !
Very disappointing service, probably one of the top 10 worst service experiences I have ever had.  Why is it necessary to make someone feel completely unwelcome in your restaurant?  From the moment we walked in and received a serious glare from the hostess, it was an uncomfortable and disappointing experience from start to finish.   The food is OK, standard run of the mill tapas place, nothing of the traditional sort but a good effort none the less.  However I am a firm believer that having good service is part of the experience of dining out.  Our cranky waiter did not want anything to do with us, and did not converse a single word with us the entire meal, except when we received the bill without anyone asking us for desert and we asked for the menu, to which he replied, "well she (the woman who cleared our plates) said you were done."  REALLY?  I'm so sorry we inconvenienced you by asking for desert.  No thank you, no nothing.  Honestly, is the restaurant experience becoming the new airline experience?  I certainly hope not.
Our meal was decidedly mediocre.  Probably because it was a Monday night, since to all appearances it looks like they have everything necessary to make each dish we had a delight.  Tapas are a wonderful balancing act, and they kept blowing it; resulting in surprisingly flavorless bland results.   Every one fell short, except the clams.  They forgot one, denied they forgot it, rushed it, and delivered it undercooked.  The patio is delightful.  The wine flights are a hoot; and certainly a sufficient reason to drop in.
Amazing, classy place. Great vibes and even better food. One of the best restaurants in Ithaca.
I love this place. I've had 3 wonderful dinners here and it seems each time is better than the previous. The tapas are delicious, varied,  and executed well, though not overly complex or pretentious. The Sangria is great and the best part about this place is the wine flights! For a small price, you can get a themed flight of wine (i.e. 5 types of local wines, or 5 types of chardonnays, etc.).

Was visiting the area with my fiancé and stopped in for dinner. Having such high reviews and recommendations by other locals, we had high expectations for this restaurant but were somewhat disappointed. I give it 3 stars because the dishes are decently priced and for the amount that we ordered, were expecting the check to be much more expensive. We ordered 6 dishes in total: -Mixed olives -Homemade focaccia -Cheese plate -Brussel sprouts -Spicy Shrimp -Buffalo meatballs I thought that the homemade foaccia and the brussel sprouts were the winners. The bread came in a huge portion, was warm, soft, and topped with a bit of sea salt which is always awesome. The brussel sprouts were soft, cheesy and flavorful. The spicy shrimp was not spicy and the buffalo meatballs were pretty bland. My fiancé ordered a wine flight which he was very happy with. We were stuffed by the end of dinner and for dessert we split the warm chocolate soufflé cake which I enjoyed. Looking back, I guess we ordered somewhat 'eh' choices but nothing really jumped out at me as I was perusing the menu at the time. The staff seemed somewhat flustered as we visited on a Saturday night during primetime dinner hours--understandable since they are very busy, I guess. They would come by the tables to drop off plates without ever really trying to organize the rest of the food on the table so at times it was somewhat awkward trying to re-position things as this man with 4 different plates was standing over us waiting for things to be re-arranged. A tip by some locals that we did not end up taking was to either arrive as soon as they opened or toward the end of the night as things started to slow down. Anyway, I think this restaurant is worth a second visit to-- I would just get different things.
What a great spot.  My husband and I had never been however we were given a gift certificate to Just a Taste so we decided to try it out.  We were very impressed!  We each ordered a salad to start, I the Mixed Greens and he the Caesar.  Both were very different but delicious: the Caesar was a creamy dressing with large cuts of romaine topped with cheese and the Mixed Greens was tossed with a balsamic vinegar.  We then ordered 4 tapas dishes, the Warm Brie with Melon and Crostini, Deep Fried Chicken Wings tossed in Sweet and Spicy Chili Sauce and Fresh Basil, Rare Grilled Flank Steak with Housemade Spicy Kim Chee, Flatbread with Manchego Cheese and Roasted Vegetables.  We were so impressed by how attentive the service was in the sense that the dishes literally came out of the kitchen steaming.

This is an Ithaca hotspot, apparently. Tapas and wine. Yeah that's what it's all about. Everything from flatbread to roasted potatoes to Brussels sprouts. Nice room with friendly, helpful service and an extensive wine selection, including multiple flights. I chose one that included a German Riesling that was so unusual I'll have to talk more about that later. I thought the price for four including the wine was a great value. Highly recommended.
Best steak fries and garlic focacia bread!! Will definitely go again whenever around ithaca. Very interesting menu, lots of choices for appetizers and drinks. Recommend this 100%.
We got a seat on a Saturday night without any reservations. Outdoor seating in the back is very nice. Me and my partner shared the foccacia, chicken wings, sauteed shrimp, and the mushrooms. The portions are large for tapas. I felt like the execution of the dishes fell flat for me. The preparation was almost too simple?  I've been to several tapas places before in other cities, and I think I've experienced better so that is why I gave it two stars. Needless to say, we did leave satisfied and the bill came out to around 24 dollars (without drinks). Good place for a cheap date.
Delicious tapas! Each tapa is out of this world.  It is a bit noisy in the restaurant and its a bit pricey for big eaters, but it is definitely worth the money!
Just moved to Ithaca from Washington, D.C. and I think this is hands down the best restaurant in town. Whereas some other places are "good for Ithaca", Just A Taste could hold up against good restaurants in DC. The small plates make it easy to try lots if throngs, which you will want to do because the menu is so great it's hard to decide what to get! I had white beans with tomatoes and peaches that was delicious and perfect summer fare. I followed with a plate of sausage and eggplant that was also delicious. One drawback: the place is small and popular so you sometimes feel like a sardine. Also while the food and wine are excellent, this is not a fine dining experience. Sometimes you'll have wild kids running around underfoot. On the upside if you eat alone at the bar you'll appreciate the lively vibe. Excellent place!
As the previous reviewers alluded to, this is a great place to go with a whole bunch of people, at least on paper. By bringing a big group, you can get in on a sort of gastronomic network effect, with the number of different flavors and preparations you can sample growing with the size of your party. Strangely, however, they have designed their business model to be in complete juxtaposition to this best utilization of their service in that they do not accept reservations. So if you are coming with a lot of friends it's best to go early, or come by, put your name in, and enjoy a few of the nearby bars for some drinks and possibly appetizers while waiting for your table to come up (they are used to this, so they will take your cell phone number, which makes the process of waiting not so bad, and certainly makes the other local restauranteurs happy).   But on to the dining itself. The place itself is small and somewhat cramped, but this contributes to rather than detracts from the experience. This type of food is about socializing, sharing, talking, and having fun, and the anbience is such that it is rather conducive to this sort of behavior. You certainly won't feel like you are out of place if you are laughing out loud or talking in an animated fashion here. And the food is exceptional. The menu is constantly in a state of flux, owing partly to the nature of the cuisine itself and also greatly due to the fact that the chef places great emphasis on utilizing locally grown, in-season ingredients. Thus there is likely to be something new to try between each visit to the place. It's best for each person to get a few starters or salad, an entree (meat) dish, and dessert. Personally, when I went I enjoyed the tortilla espanola, a traditional Spanish "tortilla" (which in Spain is more analogous to what we would call a quiche or frittata), the stuffed pork loin, potato wedges with chipotle aioli on the side, and a chocolate souffle to finish off the meal. Everything was perfectly prepared and the focus on quality and presentation, essential when serving such small portions, was excellent. And one cannot go to Just a Taste without trying some of their large selection of wines (over 40 available by the glass) or the homemade sangria, which is absolutely delicious. Overall, a very good experience, definitely worthy of repeat visits.
Food is good. Not much to choose from. Loud considering its a small dining area and everyone is so close. Smells like dirty mop water and bleach. Gray-haired male waiter didn't talk much and would just toss plates on our table. It felt like he was angry with us or something. How strange. Enjoy your tiny tip, dude.
I've been to this restaurant three times so far -- it is a great place to go out with friends and to bring out of town guests.  It can get expensive, especially if you order the meat dishes, and the portions are generally very small.  Dishes I've especially enjoyed are the potatoes with chipotle aioli (the aioli is amazing), braised greens with stilton, and focaccia.
This place has been built up as being great for 4 years.  Was it great?  Sort of.  I was expecting a more high end atmosphere when I walked in.  They do exist in Ithaca and this is a tapas bar.  I expected some sort of European flair in the decorations and I got white walls with some local art and your basic dining rooms tables and chairs.  Ok.  I can deal with that.  The service was friendly, hovered to take away finished plates (you go through them fast and you don't want them piling up), and worked to make it have a European feel.  And 4-tops that were occupied by 2 people were turned so that you faced the street and could people watch.  Too bad it was raining...  The food.  While I hope it was just the chef, the two meat dishes were over-cooked.  The veggies were perfection.  The veggies on the meat dishes were perfection.  The veggie dishes were perfection.  The take away: avoid meat dishes and don't even consider the fish because if they overcook pork loin and rabbit, there is no way that they are going to cook fish to a 'just done' point.  Or maybe is was the chef. Going back?  Sure, but only with vegetarians.  I don't mind veggie meals but it is something to keep in mind.
I just spent three years in Ithaca, and Just a Taste was by far my favorite restaurant there. It's a perfect date night place, and also good for small groups. They don't take reservations so get there early if you don't want to wait--Thursday, Fridays, and Saturdays are crazy. The staff is helpful and will take your phone number and call you when your table is ready, so you can go around the corner and grab a drink while you wait. The wine menu changes montly, and I strongly recommend going for one of their wine flights. My favorite was always the BIg Red flight. The sangria is also pretty good. The tapas menu also changes frequently, but they do seem to have a few things consistently, like the thai wings and potato wedges with spicy aoli. The focaccia with garlic is also really good. They used to have an excellent brunch (best in Ithaca), but I've heard that they don't serve brunch anymore. This is very sad--those donuts were amazing.
This is my favorite restaurant in Ithaca. Great quality food at reasonable prices. The dishes are both interesting and delicious!
if i had to choose a final meal, it would be tapas from just a taste. loved every single item i have ever tried here. i miss this restaurant so much. sometimes i have dreams about it. that's love.
This is a restaurant with a discerning difference in its format. Like the name, it implies a minute taste of something-hopefully-spectacular. So yes,  this was a bit like a tapas joint in which 'apps' and 'entrees' were thrown out the window. Set on a round table, my sister, brother, his gf, and I perused the menu in earnest for a fulfilling dinner. We ordered sangrias and when they arrived, we were really quite pleased. They were amazing! Fruity with a hint of alcohol, it was almost like a juice box to me. Note to self: Dangerous! bit.ly/1cRR3AT My brother kept trying to take large sips but my wary glares of 'Mine!' eventually backed him off. 5/5 As a replacement app, we ordered melty brie and crostini. Hmm, a pretty sloppy presentation but the brie was gooey and rich, complementing the sweet, ripened slices of melon. Using the crostini as crunchy vehicles were a delight! :D bit.ly/14ReW6t 5/5 For entrees, my sister and I shared a pan of spicy shrimp sautéed with tomato, onions, lime, and cilantro. This was one of the better ceviches I've had. Perfectly cooked shrimp swimming in a flavorful soup with a kick. This was light and refreshing albeit a tiny portion. bit.ly/13pN7nN 4/5 As for my brother and his gf, they shared a piping hot lamb and rice dish. They enjoyed it but I had 'just a taste' (harhar) and it was a tad salty for my liking. This too was an ill and meager replacement as an entree. bit.ly/1dcEr5P 2/5 Still ravenous, we ordered a side of white and portabella mushrooms sauteed in butter with garlic and thyme. I demolished this tiny bowl by myself. I loved it! Mushrooms were tender and that buttery, rich sauce was like crack. bit.ly/144l1wQ 5/5 Yummy!! I wish there was more!! bit.ly/1aaWOZd Overall, the prices were quite fair. If we split the tab, we would have equally paid approximately twelve dollars but my older sister paid for everything. A really lovely meal but we still left wanting more food. And that was when we spotted Jimmy John's next door...
I was actually underwhelmed by this restaurant after all of the hype. We ended up waiting over an hour, which is to be expected on a weekend night there, but it was actually longer than they said it would be, which restaurants usually try to avoid. The wait staff were downright rude at some points. They didn't seem very interested in helping us, in fact the gentleman who was supposed to be taking care of us seemed downright annoyed most of the night. It was packed, and loud, and we were seated right in the middle of the room so every time the door opened we were blasted with cold air and people were knocking into our chairs. The food was good, but nothing I couldn't have made at home. It didn't strike me as particularly special.
We moved to Ithaca in the fall of 2013 and heard that this was the hot spot downtown! We live in Fall Creek, only a short 5 blocks away so we certainly had to give this place a try. I think in hindsight we had pretty high expectations for some NYC quality tapas, but the place is very nice. When the weather is nice they have an absolutely beautiful patio in the back, so it opens up quite a bit of space. However, in the late rainy fall when we went in it was quite packed and took us over 35 minutes to get a table. Although it seems on the weekends that is pretty standard for this block of downtown pizzaz. We decided to wait for our table at the bar, and I got a wine flight which was amazing and really reasonably priced. The wine was delicious and we got a little appetizer to pass the time. When we did get our table we ordered a few dishes to share and they were fairly reasonably priced but some of them seemed either too small for what they cost or too simple. I had expected something more up to the slow food/farm-to-table standards for their prices. I think this would be a great place for two couples or a group to share a lot of things, although some of the plates are quite small. As far as vegetarian fare, it can be a little limited, and even more so with vegan. When we went the service was pretty good and the menu is quite long with several very inexpensive items and several very expensive items for everyone's price range.
This was one of the worst meals I have ever had.  The wine had obviously been in the fridge for a long time and was losing its flavor.  Of the five dishes we had, 4 were awful.  The tuna poached in oil was so overcooked I could barely chew it.  Same for the lamb and the duck.  I'm not sure how you can remove all the taste and fat from a duck leg, but this restaurant managed to do it.  Finally, all of the flavors were either off, or simply missing.  For example, the lamb was served in an Indian inspired sauce, which tasted as if the chef had added the spices right at the last minute - they were raw and gritty in the sauce.  Other items simply lacked any taste at all, or were mismatched with the other items on the plate.  The only good thing I can say about this restaurant is that the patio is very nice - if you can ignore the table that was so sticky I didn't want to touch it.
Big tapas, if you're into it. Hint: I'm into it. Went here with my lady companion and got 5 or 6 dishes. Russet wedges, scallops, ceviche, spring mix salad, and gazpacho and maybe something else that I'm forgetting. Everything was delicious. Seriously, couldn't go wrong with any of those choices. Also, they're a little more generous than most tapas places I've been, in that each plates takes more than a couple bites to finish. Perhaps my big city livin' has shaded my expectations. Outdoor seating here is wonderful. The indoor has a nice atmosphere as well. If you're in Ithaca and you'd like a nice dinner, definitely come here.
As the previous reviewers alluded to, this is a great place to go with a whole bunch of people, at least on paper. By bringing a big group, you can get in on a sort of gastronomic network effect, with the number of different flavors and preparations you can sample growing with the size of your party. Strangely, however, they have designed their business model to be in complete juxtaposition to this best utilization of their service in that they do not accept reservations. So if you are coming with a lot of friends it's best to go early, or come by, put your name in, and enjoy a few of the nearby bars for some drinks and possibly appetizers while waiting for your table to come up (they are used to this, so they will take your cell phone number, which makes the process of waiting not so bad, and certainly makes the other local restauranteurs happy).   But on to the dining itself. The place itself is small and somewhat cramped, but this contributes to rather than detracts from the experience. This type of food is about socializing, sharing, talking, and having fun, and the anbience is such that it is rather conducive to this sort of behavior. You certainly won't feel like you are out of place if you are laughing out loud or talking in an animated fashion here. And the food is exceptional. The menu is constantly in a state of flux, owing partly to the nature of the cuisine itself and also greatly due to the fact that the chef places great emphasis on utilizing locally grown, in-season ingredients. Thus there is likely to be something new to try between each visit to the place. It's best for each person to get a few starters or salad, an entree (meat) dish, and dessert. Personally, when I went I enjoyed the tortilla espanola, a traditional Spanish "tortilla" (which in Spain is more analogous to what we would call a quiche or frittata), the stuffed pork loin, potato wedges with chipotle aioli on the side, and a chocolate souffle to finish off the meal. Everything was perfectly prepared and the focus on quality and presentation, essential when serving such small portions, was excellent. And one cannot go to Just a Taste without trying some of their large selection of wines (over 40 available by the glass) or the homemade sangria, which is absolutely delicious. Overall, a very good experience, definitely worthy of repeat visits.
The food ranges from great to just ok, depending on what you order. I can't help but feel like they would benefit from reducing the quantity and increasing the quality of options on the menu. The service, unfortunately, is even less consistent. The first time I went here our waitress was super friendly. This most recent visit, not so much. Both times, empty serving plates were not cleared until they had already begun to pile up, and the staff never replace the plates you eat off, which is a shame because by the third or fourth menu item, you run into some serious flavor contamination. All in all, this is a fine restaurant that could be great if they tightened up their game.
The chef is masterful with seafood.  Seared snapper with poached pears was heavenly.  We thought it couldn't be topped. But the skate was magnificent!  WIne was excellent, service excellent, prices more reasonable than we pay in the Washington, DC area.
Dec 11, 13 Thanks for my Dutch friend Kenny who recommending this tapa eatery to me. Warm Brie with Apple and Crostini          Heartily I wonder why somebody recommended this in his yelp review. Melted cheese, sliced apple, sliced dry bread and THAT IS ALL. Piled on a tatty plate. Can't I make this at home within 1 minute and $2? You can get everything in Wegmans. But except that one dish above, Just a Taste is excellent, for a date, a gathering with friends, or a happily enjoyable solitary repast. Amiable servant, nostalgic ambiance (look at those vintage radios above the bar!). I'm glad that they have a coat rack. Spicy Shrimp Saute with Garlic, Jalapeño, Onions, Lime and Cilantro         Shrimps were really enriched by the collocation of spice. Grilled Pork Loin         Tender inside and served with Roast Butternut Squash Mash and Mushroom. Spinach Salad with Pears, Walnuts, Feta, Red Onion Deep Fried Salt Cod Fritters with Garlic Aioli and Mixed Greens
I've been to this restaurant three times so far -- it is a great place to go out with friends and to bring out of town guests.  It can get expensive, especially if you order the meat dishes, and the portions are generally very small.  Dishes I've especially enjoyed are the potatoes with chipotle aioli (the aioli is amazing), braised greens with stilton, and focaccia.
It took me two years to finally get here. Two friends I respect told me it's their favorite restaurant. I can see why. Incredibly versatile, all delicious, all fresh. We had a tomato caprese salad. Amazing. A Spanish tortolla egg n potato, just right, not too heavy. Gazpacho we would come back for. Only problem: only open evenings and no reservations. But worth the wait.
Oh yum. So we went here during our "camping trip" (that's how I roll) and thought it was excellent. We ordered: racion (full portion) of focaccia with a whole head of roasted garlic (which turned brown unfort.); hummus with beets and feta; bowties with steak and mushrooms (one of their two entrees on that menu); and zucchini with cheese and pecans (or walnuts? I forget) in a brown butter sauce. The focaccia was good, less airy than I am used to, and just salted (no herbs) but it was yummy and warm. The hummus must have been house made or local or something- it was thicker and chunkier than reg. hummus and it had a lemony taste. With the beets and cheese? Holy crap! I could eat that EVERY DAY for lunch. Warm triangle of pita were served with it. It was a pretty large portion (larger than I would expect a tapas portion to be). The pasta was freaking phenomenal. For real, the beef was tender, the sauce was creamy and buttery and heart-attack inducing and the mushrooms and carrots were nice touches. The zucchini was cooked perfectly in a baking dish with browned butter, nuts, and cheese. Holy crap. Also a pretty large portion. I had the "local" wine flight for $11, which had a lovely sparkling wine, a chardonnay (not my fave to begin with), two Reislings (both yummy) and a nice ummmmm pinot? I dunno. It was red. Go here. It was awesome.
This is a perfect location for dates. The atmosphere is romantic and the service was wonderful. Choosing which tapas you want to order creates a fun dining experience. The food has always been amazing as well.
I just spent three years in Ithaca, and Just a Taste was by far my favorite restaurant there. It's a perfect date night place, and also good for small groups. They don't take reservations so get there early if you don't want to wait--Thursday, Fridays, and Saturdays are crazy. The staff is helpful and will take your phone number and call you when your table is ready, so you can go around the corner and grab a drink while you wait. The wine menu changes montly, and I strongly recommend going for one of their wine flights. My favorite was always the BIg Red flight. The sangria is also pretty good. The tapas menu also changes frequently, but they do seem to have a few things consistently, like the thai wings and potato wedges with spicy aoli. The focaccia with garlic is also really good. They used to have an excellent brunch (best in Ithaca), but I've heard that they don't serve brunch anymore. This is very sad--those donuts were amazing.
First off if you don't get there when they open, your not getting a seat! But don't let that deter you because the wait is well worth it! The food here is not just extraordinary but in my opinion may be the best in Ithaca. The prices are decent as well which one wouldn't expect for a place like this. Personally the Salt Cod Fritters were my wife's favorite as well as myself. They are just amazing and every time we go we have to order 2! The Russet potatoes with the Chipotle Aioli is my second favorite, for something so simple they are fantastic. The wings I ordered were the biggest and meatiest wings I've ever had. Their bread is always baked fresh and is just amazing. I don't think there has ever been something I tried that I did not like. This is consistently my wife's and I date night restaurant and we will continue to go there many more times in the future!
Food is great.  Menu is constantly rotating.  You can't go wrong with pretty much anything on the menu.  The only drawbacks to this place is the limited seating capacity in the winter and the fact that its easy to order too much food for a group.
Always wonderful food.  Lovely staff.  Great wine list including flights.  Desserts worth a special mention as they are far better than others in town.  As long as you don't mind shared plates this is the place to dine in Ithaca.  Just look out for the wait - no reservations.  Ouch! Favorites include focaccia, braised greens, brussels sprouts, baked brie, russet wedges...stop me before I list the entire menu...
if i had to choose a final meal, it would be tapas from just a taste. loved every single item i have ever tried here. i miss this restaurant so much. sometimes i have dreams about it. that's love.
I've been going to JAT for years.  My husband proposed to me there.  We can always get out of there around $50.00 having eaten at least five tapas dishes, two glasses of wine AND dessert.  Honestly we've never had to wait that long, it does help to get there early.  But even in the dead of winter I've never had to wait longer than the time it takes me to have a glass of wine at the bar.  As for the service, it's never bothered me but I do believe they are their own special,  snarky bunch.  My favorite is the tall guy.  He's been there forever, he's totally a sarcastic bastard but damn if he can't recommend the best glass of wine to go with your meal.  None of them have ever been rude to us and our service has never been lacking.  They just don't have a killer bedside manner which is fine with me.  I don't feel like chatting up the waitstaff when I just want to eat anyway. Our favorites: Foccacia w/ Roasted Garlic and Oli Deep Fried Potato Wedges with Chipotle Aioli Brussels Sprouts Any of their shrimp dishes Any of their pork dishes Chicken Wings If you can sit outside on the patio out back in the summer it's great.  Sure the tables wobble like crazy but it's the perfect amount of shade and you totally forget that you're surrounded by car fumes, noise, drug dealers and annoying college students.
This is a pretty great place to hang out on a summer day and enjoy a few small plates with a friend.  The service can be a little forgetful at times, though.
Very disappointing service, probably one of the top 10 worst service experiences I have ever had.  Why is it necessary to make someone feel completely unwelcome in your restaurant?  From the moment we walked in and received a serious glare from the hostess, it was an uncomfortable and disappointing experience from start to finish.   The food is OK, standard run of the mill tapas place, nothing of the traditional sort but a good effort none the less.  However I am a firm believer that having good service is part of the experience of dining out.  Our cranky waiter did not want anything to do with us, and did not converse a single word with us the entire meal, except when we received the bill without anyone asking us for desert and we asked for the menu, to which he replied, "well she (the woman who cleared our plates) said you were done."  REALLY?  I'm so sorry we inconvenienced you by asking for desert.  No thank you, no nothing.  Honestly, is the restaurant experience becoming the new airline experience?  I certainly hope not.
I was actually underwhelmed by this restaurant after all of the hype. We ended up waiting over an hour, which is to be expected on a weekend night there, but it was actually longer than they said it would be, which restaurants usually try to avoid. The wait staff were downright rude at some points. They didn't seem very interested in helping us, in fact the gentleman who was supposed to be taking care of us seemed downright annoyed most of the night. It was packed, and loud, and we were seated right in the middle of the room so every time the door opened we were blasted with cold air and people were knocking into our chairs. The food was good, but nothing I couldn't have made at home. It didn't strike me as particularly special.
Was visiting the area with my fiancé and stopped in for dinner. Having such high reviews and recommendations by other locals, we had high expectations for this restaurant but were somewhat disappointed. I give it 3 stars because the dishes are decently priced and for the amount that we ordered, were expecting the check to be much more expensive. We ordered 6 dishes in total: -Mixed olives -Homemade focaccia -Cheese plate -Brussel sprouts -Spicy Shrimp -Buffalo meatballs I thought that the homemade foaccia and the brussel sprouts were the winners. The bread came in a huge portion, was warm, soft, and topped with a bit of sea salt which is always awesome. The brussel sprouts were soft, cheesy and flavorful. The spicy shrimp was not spicy and the buffalo meatballs were pretty bland. My fiancé ordered a wine flight which he was very happy with. We were stuffed by the end of dinner and for dessert we split the warm chocolate soufflé cake which I enjoyed. Looking back, I guess we ordered somewhat 'eh' choices but nothing really jumped out at me as I was perusing the menu at the time. The staff seemed somewhat flustered as we visited on a Saturday night during primetime dinner hours--understandable since they are very busy, I guess. They would come by the tables to drop off plates without ever really trying to organize the rest of the food on the table so at times it was somewhat awkward trying to re-position things as this man with 4 different plates was standing over us waiting for things to be re-arranged. A tip by some locals that we did not end up taking was to either arrive as soon as they opened or toward the end of the night as things started to slow down. Anyway, I think this restaurant is worth a second visit to-- I would just get different things.
Mmmmmmmm. So what if there is a wait. It's worth the wait. Every time. The braised greens are perfect. Brussel sprouts, spectacular. Savory, flavorful food that is well cooked. While I no longer live in Ithaca or anywhere nearby, Just a Taste is a must!
I love tapas, because I love variety.  Just A Taste does variety extremely well. Their menu is always changing depending on what's in season, but it's all very good.  I've been several times, and the following menu items stand out: - flatbread of the day - Brussels sprouts - sautéed garlic greens - sautéed mushrooms (sometimes over salted) - shrimp (however it's prepared, it's always sweet and succulent) I always get a wine flight (again, variety) since there's a nice healthy tasting of each wine.  More bang for your buck!  Tapas can be on the pricey side, especially here, so it's important to make your green stretch when you can.  I definitely recommend sharing a few plates between friends!  Oh, and be prepared to wait.
This was one of the worst meals I have ever had.  The wine had obviously been in the fridge for a long time and was losing its flavor.  Of the five dishes we had, 4 were awful.  The tuna poached in oil was so overcooked I could barely chew it.  Same for the lamb and the duck.  I'm not sure how you can remove all the taste and fat from a duck leg, but this restaurant managed to do it.  Finally, all of the flavors were either off, or simply missing.  For example, the lamb was served in an Indian inspired sauce, which tasted as if the chef had added the spices right at the last minute - they were raw and gritty in the sauce.  Other items simply lacked any taste at all, or were mismatched with the other items on the plate.  The only good thing I can say about this restaurant is that the patio is very nice - if you can ignore the table that was so sticky I didn't want to touch it.
This place was recommended to us, and we recommend it to you. We ordered at least a dozen dishes to share, not one was sub-par. The Shepard's Pie was exquisite, and authentic. You can get wine flights too. Lovely dinner overall.
Not just my favorite restaurant in Ithaca, but one of my favorite restaurants ever.  And I'm kinda obsessed with food and have been to many highly rated restaurants in NYC and the Bay Area.   Highly recommend: 1) Chicken wings - has a spicy red curry sauce (pretty spicy) with lots of aromatic basil.  It is absolutely delicious and I'm salivating just thinking about it.  I don't know why most wing joints don't have thai curry as a flavor in addition to say teriyaki and garlic parmesan. 2) Garlic braised greens - collard greens, sherry vinegar, lots of garlic and walnuts topped with Point Reyes blue cheese.  Doesn't sound like it would be amazing, but it is.  The combination of the acidity, the nutty flavor from the walnuts and the saltiness of the cheese really blends well together. 3) Foccacia bread - warm and crusty, not over oily, served with an entire head of roasted garlic.  enough said. 4) Souffle - served warn.  perfect amount of sweetness and just a tad liquidity in the center to make it rich.  the ganache that's on top is to die for.   The wait there is usually pretty long, up to an hour during dinner time on weekends so be advised.  The service ranges from great to mediocre depends on how busy they get.  The price is very reasonable (with a flight of wine shared between 2 people about 50-60 dollars or so) at least in my consideration, but maybe I'm just being used to being ripped off all the time in San Francisco
Went here last night for a girls night with several co-workers. We ordered a HUGE array of items from the menu and not a single one was a disappointment! The Warm brie and melon was melty, delectable, yumminess!! We had chicken braised in coconut milk hot wings with a coconut basil sweet and spicy sauce, brown sugar cured goat belly, brown butter squash with pecans, and a ton of other dishes! We were stuffed and satisfied!! Then we started contemplating dessert... we were absolutely too full for another bite... yet we ended up ordering one of every dessert on the menu and they were even better than the meal!! This place is a definite gem!!! The only downside was that to get to the outdoor seating, you are taken on a walk through the "guts" of the building, passing bathrooms, kitchen, cleaning buckets, etc... before coming back out into the sunshine. But the food whisked that memory from my mind in no time at all!
The chef is masterful with seafood.  Seared snapper with poached pears was heavenly.  We thought it couldn't be topped. But the skate was magnificent!  WIne was excellent, service excellent, prices more reasonable than we pay in the Washington, DC area.
BEST DINNER IN TOWN. Every time. Every food item is just so great. The potato wedges with chipotle aioli - SO AWESOME, the flank steak - OF COURSE, don't even get us started on the ROASTED GARLIC with foccacia, and man oh man the brussel sprouts with romano and pecans!! We never thought we'd be raving about brussel sprouts! AND THE CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE we almost died. Especially because we tried to eat everything on the menu because it's all so good which led to three hour long food comas. And that's not even getting into the wine selection, which is awesome (even though we do not know much about wines, we do know that all the wines we've had at Just A Taste have been so so good). The service is great, they bring the first item out so fast, and then just keep bringing them, until you are swimming in tapas heaven. Nothing bad to say about Just A Taste, except for the fact that it is TOO good.
Great service.  Always very good and sometimes stellar food.  Long waits on weekend, but worth it.  Love their commitment to showing art, too.
Stopped through Ithaca while helping our daughter move -- we were hot, sweaty, hungry, and maybe just a little giddy with fatigue.  It was a good meal and we had fun, but there is definitely room for improvement in what other reviewers claim is the best restaurant in town... This is one of those times i wish I could give separate ratings, and use half stars, for the food (4), the atmosphere (3.5), and the service (3).  Overall, I'd give it a 3.5 if I could. We were seated right away in the nice little patio in back of the restaurant, where we waited a seemingly unreasonable amount of time before anyone offered us drinks and took our order.  I swear that the three servers purposefully looked away when passing our table, which was quite close to the door... (unsolicited advice: If you want to sit back there -- and it is *nice* on a warm summer night -- I recommend squinting your eyes as tightly as possible as your waiter leads you through the less-than-clean hallway to the back so you don't loose your appetite...but not so tightly that you risk brushing up against the nasty ole' walls...) (note to management: if you clean up that scary hallway and the bathroom walls, I would give you 4 stars.  It was that bad.  I rarely give that much weight to atmosphere, especially in non-essential parts of the facility, but c'mon, people!) But once the orders were taken (oh, about 2 days later.  it may have been less.  hard to tell. we were really hungry), the dishes came out quickly and the server was much more attentive. Here is my summary: Vegetables, good!  Meat...not so much, really. Of the 7 or so little dishes we ordered, I have to say that I loved the Caesar salad and the summer squash the best.  One of the best I've had anywhere, the Caesar has a nice balance of the tart lemon and bright garlic, a touch of the salty anchovy (but not too much!), and just the right level of creaminess without being too heavy -- and the whole romaine leaves were oh-so- fresh.  I asked for anchovies and was quickly delivered 4 tasty little fishies. The summer squash in brown butter sauce with pecans sounds so deceptively simple and plain, but was so gosh-darn good I could have eaten a potful and then licked the pot.  The sauce had a depth I cannot explain.  Something more than brown butter is going on in there.  It makes me want to subscribe to an overpriced foodie magazine from whom I can request and get the restaurant's recipe... We landed up ordering seconds of both of those dishes. My friend's salad with baby greens and goat cheese was lovely.  Excellent goat cheese -- I mean, better than usual.  They do seem to go for really fresh and quality produce here. The brie with melon, of course, was so good, but really, how can one screw up melted brie?  The melon was nice and sweet and fresh, but I could have used 2 more of those very thin, almost transparent slices.  Again, evidence of picking really fine products and produce for their dishes. Meatballs with couscous and mint yoghurt was extremely underwhelming.  Too dry. The Madeira sauce that came with the sauteed chicken breast and potatoes was quite good...but some of the chicken pieces, like the meatballs, were a bit overcooked.  Why, oh why will I never remember to *not* order the chicken!?!?! The scallop half of our mussels-and-scallop dish was excellent.  A few of the mussels, sadly, were a bit skunky, and my husband claimed the smoked paprika and tomato broth that it came in smelled like a barn.  (But he says this about a lot of things, actually.)  I thought it smelled faintly like could-be-fresher sea food, but it tasted okay. My husband ordered the bread pudding, but I can't tell you about it because he ate it so quickly I never got a bite -- I was finishing up my second Caesar salad... There were lots of other dishes I would love to try, and despite rating it 3 stars, I will go back because it is, rumor has it, the best place in town.
Oh yum. So we went here during our "camping trip" (that's how I roll) and thought it was excellent. We ordered: racion (full portion) of focaccia with a whole head of roasted garlic (which turned brown unfort.); hummus with beets and feta; bowties with steak and mushrooms (one of their two entrees on that menu); and zucchini with cheese and pecans (or walnuts? I forget) in a brown butter sauce. The focaccia was good, less airy than I am used to, and just salted (no herbs) but it was yummy and warm. The hummus must have been house made or local or something- it was thicker and chunkier than reg. hummus and it had a lemony taste. With the beets and cheese? Holy crap! I could eat that EVERY DAY for lunch. Warm triangle of pita were served with it. It was a pretty large portion (larger than I would expect a tapas portion to be). The pasta was freaking phenomenal. For real, the beef was tender, the sauce was creamy and buttery and heart-attack inducing and the mushrooms and carrots were nice touches. The zucchini was cooked perfectly in a baking dish with browned butter, nuts, and cheese. Holy crap. Also a pretty large portion. I had the "local" wine flight for $11, which had a lovely sparkling wine, a chardonnay (not my fave to begin with), two Reislings (both yummy) and a nice ummmmm pinot? I dunno. It was red. Go here. It was awesome.
If you're obsessed with removing crumbs from your dinner table then be prepared for an evening of anxiety and frustration.  For some reason, Just A Taste fails to use tablecloths.  The tabletops are formica-ed and patterned with motes (is that a crumb?) and over the years have become gouged (is that a crumb?) by the frantic stabs of customers searching for more food.  Okay, I realize that tapas are appetizer portions and the whole point is to order a bunch and sit back and sample and talk and impress everybody with your spot-on pronunciations of "gruyere" and "charmoula" and "achiote".  But still, my date and I had to order 7 tapas and dessert before we even felt remotely full.  Did somebody say gluttony?  I know, I know, it's a deadly sin but so is lust and l can assure you that lust was not practiced that night. Because here is my point.  The food at Just A Taste is fantastic.  The space inspires claustrophobia, the service is indifferent at best, and the flatware follows the lead of the tabletops.  But the food, the food glorious food, is worth it.  Before you know it you'll have eaten like a starving orphan and be too sluggish to consummate the event that made you ask her out in the first place. My advice - save Just A Taste for one of those group dinners with all your friends.
Recently, they seem to have had a change in the kitchen staff and the "interestingness" and quality of dishes has dropped noticeably. They lost their mojo. Otherwise, it is generally a decent place to have a casual meal. Normally, I would give it 4 stars for its cutting edge originality and very attentive wait staff. If they fix the back room issue, it will be outstanding again. For those of you who are not familiar with the place, its rather unconventional. It's usually fully packed and highly informal atmosphere. You MUST arrive at 5:20 to wait outside and get a table. They're strangely fanatical about NOT opening their doors until 5:30 on the nose. Dishes arrive when completed rather that all at once. The wait staff is VERY attentive and provide excellent service given their scheme. If you're coming from "downstate" you will probably find the J-A-T scheme to be irritating and unsavory. My advice, relax and enjoy interesting combinations of food cooked with FRESH ingredients in a casual atmosphere. No downstate cologne/perfume-wearing uptight wait staff. You can wear sweatpans, ski clothes or a suit. The wine selection is merely average, and as such typically results in some bad ones and some OK ones. Never really exceptional, but mostly passable and fun to try in their various tasting "flights". If you truly like food and an honest food experience, try it and you will not be displeased. Depending in who is in the back, you may even be "wowed".
There's a back story to this exemplary review: Just a Taste is where my now long-time girlfriend and I went on our first date. That first visit, we were both so excited, nervous, and talkative that we forgot to eat, which is a shame because in my opinion JaT has the best food Ithaca has to offer. Since then, we've come here about once every month to celebrate small life victories and special occasions ("The sun came out in Ithaca today! Let's go to JaT!"). We've come to know the menu up and down, though items do change occasionally or an old favorite gets re-invented. Everything on the menu is excellent. The flank steak is one of our favorites, as is the sauteed spicy shrimp dish. But we don't kid ourselves: it's really the deep fried russet potato wedges with chipotle aioli that keep us coming back. We're relatively poor students and I'm a long-distance runner, so we think nothing of ordering more carbs like the mouth-watering focaccia (which is also great to dip in the leftover aioli) or the tortilla espanola. So tasty. Beverages? Dessert? The wine flights and the occasional dessert do the trick and are reasonably priced: we order these "add-ons" only for very special occasions, but we've always been pleased when we do. Service is adequate and the staff are always friendly, though food is often airdropped in like it's Operation Market Garden. The decor is fun: we have several games/activities to play at Just a Taste. The first one is "Which plate am I am going to get?". This one requires my gf and I to pick which of the two kitchy and non-matching plates we'd like to use. Another one is to see if the artwork has changed since we came last. Unfortunately, there's also the game of "how long do you think we'll have to wait to get in tonight?" that we play every time we want to head here, but any wait is worth it in the long run. I can't recommend Just a Taste enough, especially for college aged guys looking to actually be classy and take their significant other or romantic interest on a date to this fun, delicious, and (depending on what you order) reasonably priced tapas restaurant. Bravo!
Food is great.  Menu is constantly rotating.  You can't go wrong with pretty much anything on the menu.  The only drawbacks to this place is the limited seating capacity in the winter and the fact that its easy to order too much food for a group.
Based on the positive reviews, my wife and I stopped in for a Saturday lunch. Fantastic. So many delicious items on the menu, it was difficult to choose. We started with the Housemade Focaccia with Roast Garlic. Bread lovers beware - their Focaccia is crazy good.  I got the Quail stuffed with bacon and mushrooms on a bed of chedder grits. My wife got a sandwich on Focaccia that was a potato/cheese thing - i forget the name. Also delicious. We weren't ready for midday wine, so we'll definitely have to go back for that. Their wine selection was great.  Many people were ordering flights, and they looked really tasty. They also have a wide variety of beers (4 draft, 12+ in bottles). The decor is what robbed Just A Taste of 5 stars. When the food is this good, I like to see a little effort go into the design of the restaurant. The art on the wall was mildly interesting, but the space was very bland. The tables/floor combo made me feel like it was in a cafeteria. So much could be done with this place. It's a shame to see wasted potential. Also, our waitress was really really slow. Sometimes slow is a good thing, and we didn't mind terribly, but had we been in a rush, it would have not been pretty. But the food cannot be beat. For that alone, everyone should try this place. SO YUMMY!
I love Just A Taste!!  But they need to be bigger.  It's a small cozy restaurant with great atmosphere. However, definitely call ahead to make reservations. Variety of great tapas and wonderful wines by the flight (5 samples in a variety of themes, or you can mix and match!) glass, and bottle.  They also have a full bar too.  The menu and wine list are ever changing, and always spectacular.  Great emphasis on local and fresh ingredients too!  They also have outdoor seating at their back patio in the warm months. Must go, great for dates and small groups, but call ahead first!
I went to Just A Taste after reading such informative reviews from the lovely Yelpers below. Thankfully, I knew what to expect: great food, spotty service, an unremarkable interior, and a long wait. We arrived around 7, were told it would take about an hour for a table, gave our cell phone number, and went for a walk. About 45 minutes later, we got a call that our table was ready, and headed over to find an old, rickety, bare table with glasses of water and menus already laid out for us. After looking over the menu of tapas-style New American food, we decided on: 1. Warm brie with melon and crostini 2. Tortilla Española of eggs, onion, and potato with garlic aioli and mixed greens 3. Pork with bacon-ragout and soft polenta 4. Pan-fried mackerel with spinach in a garlic and butter sauce Everything exceeded our expectations. The brie, melon, and crostini was the simplest dish and absolutely delicious. The Tortilla Española was like a dense crustless quiche and went incredibly well with the aioli and the salad. The pork was a thin cutlet with polenta and ragout layered on top. The textures and flavors were so interesting and delightful. The mackerel wasn't what we were expecting, but it was really good, too. Since mackerel is such an oily fish, it doesn't need butter or sauce. The flavor of the sauce was delicious, but masked the mackerel flavor maybe a little too much. The portions were small, but not too small. We probably could have had another portion or two, but decided to leave some space for dessert. We had: 5. Almond-poppyseed turnovers with vanilla creme anglese and orange slices 6. Chocolate lava cake with chocolate sauce Oh, boy! The turnovers were my favorite. When all the elements were combined, it was like eating an orange-poppyseed scone, which I love. Yum! All in all, this place is worth going to, as long as you know in advance that the wait will take forever and the service and atmosphere leave much to be desired. The food is outstanding!
This is a pretty great place to hang out on a summer day and enjoy a few small plates with a friend.  The service can be a little forgetful at times, though.
One of my favorite restaurants in Ithaca. The small plates are perfect for sharing and trying a bunch of dishes.  The dishes change frequently enough that you can try new things, but some staples are always on the menu.  Good date spot  - sit at a small table and share food :) My favorites are: - hot brie with melon and bread - potato wedges - baked garlic - sauteed mushrooms - sauteed shrimp
I've only been here once but I loved it.  Definitely try a wine flight.  My favorite tapas were the brussel sprouts (I know, I was skeptical too) and the salt cod fritters.
One of the best meals of my life. The half hour wait was worth it. Everything was good and some plates exceptional. Favorites included the warm brie with melon, fried salt cod (surprising, delicious texture) and the local lamb with mushrooms, onions and peppers.  Spanish wine flight for $13.50 includes 5 healthy half (2/3ish) glasses of delightful varied cheap wines.   Summer squash with brown butter, garlic and walnuts was great but didn't have enough walnuts so the balance was off. Dessert:  omg I'm a happy fatty. Good coffee. Peach rhubarb Betty was like a good hug. homie, warm, flavourful and not too sweet, topped with deelish whipped cream. Cheese pie was friggin amazing. I've never had something that tasted like sweet cheese. Sounds kind of gross actually, but the cheese pie was dynomite.  Think:  fluffy cheesecake that tastes subtley like bonbelle original. In short:  go here. Go here and gorge on a delicious varied selection of epicurean delights. Don't look at any more reviews,  just go here.
Mmmmmmmm. So what if there is a wait. It's worth the wait. Every time. The braised greens are perfect. Brussel sprouts, spectacular. Savory, flavorful food that is well cooked. While I no longer live in Ithaca or anywhere nearby, Just a Taste is a must!
Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Ithaca. There are a few reasons for this: 1 - the food itself is really excellent...the combinations of flavors are out of this world and most of the dishes I've tried reflect this 2 - about half of the menu changes daily but there are still the same proportions of each type of food (i.e. chicken, seafood, vegetarian, etc) - basically it's just the preparation that changes some way 3 - it's a good place to go with people with varying tastes and who are into different types of food. Just a Taste will satisfy vegans and meat lovers alike. Some of my favorite dishes: Focaccia with roast garlic - one of my favorite things to share with the table (although secretly i wish i could eat the whole thing). Definitely a crowd pleaser Deep fried russett potato wedges - again a dish that everybody loves. I haven't had any complaints yet! Chocolate souffle for dessert - to die for! So rich and decadent, if you go you need to have this Those are just a few of my favorites, but even though I like meat, their vegetarian dishes are also very good and different. I also enjoy the wine flights. They average between 8 and 12 dollars for a flight of 5 different wines. They have the flights divided up into different categories and the selection seems to change often.
Just a Taste is by far my favorite restaurant in Ithaca. I have never had a bad meal there. The potato wedges are always great, and the cod fritters are to die for! Always the place to go for a fabulous meal and great wine!!
One of our all time favorites in Ithaca. First, it is hard to get a table because there is a long wait list, because its so popular. But one you sit down, you are drenched with the sounds of conversation, delicious smells and a large selection of wine. We have gotten a number of wine flights, and they have papers to explain it all to you. We could literally spend hours in there eating and drinking. All of the food is incredible and the wait staff couldn't be nicer.
Not just my favorite restaurant in Ithaca, but one of my favorite restaurants ever.  And I'm kinda obsessed with food and have been to many highly rated restaurants in NYC and the Bay Area.   Highly recommend: 1) Chicken wings - has a spicy red curry sauce (pretty spicy) with lots of aromatic basil.  It is absolutely delicious and I'm salivating just thinking about it.  I don't know why most wing joints don't have thai curry as a flavor in addition to say teriyaki and garlic parmesan. 2) Garlic braised greens - collard greens, sherry vinegar, lots of garlic and walnuts topped with Point Reyes blue cheese.  Doesn't sound like it would be amazing, but it is.  The combination of the acidity, the nutty flavor from the walnuts and the saltiness of the cheese really blends well together. 3) Foccacia bread - warm and crusty, not over oily, served with an entire head of roasted garlic.  enough said. 4) Souffle - served warn.  perfect amount of sweetness and just a tad liquidity in the center to make it rich.  the ganache that's on top is to die for.   The wait there is usually pretty long, up to an hour during dinner time on weekends so be advised.  The service ranges from great to mediocre depends on how busy they get.  The price is very reasonable (with a flight of wine shared between 2 people about 50-60 dollars or so) at least in my consideration, but maybe I'm just being used to being ripped off all the time in San Francisco
Even though I've not had the privelege of eating at Just a Taste for some months (during which I've been at the other end of the United States), I can recall the excellence of the food and the helpfulness of the staff. I try to engage the waitstaff as much as possible (given the crowd that is typical, this can be difficult) so that I can glean any insight that might not be obvious from outside the kitchen. The first time I went, the gentleman was kind enough to suggest agreeable wines and portions for the company. When the food arrived, talking practically ceased. The flavors were excellent, the presentation suitable, and the experience as a whole came together beautifully. I'm glad to say that I've been back and I'll continue to visit this establishment when time and location provide for such opportunity.
Bravo! This place must be the most popular in downtown Ithaca. On a Friday night there were seats available everywhere else but here. We ended up waiting an hour (having a drink at a nearby bar so it wasn't really a hardship) and it was well worth it. They have the tapas menu nailed down. Huge variety of flavors, all of the plates were easily splttable two ways (don't  you hate it when appetizers come in odd numbers so  you have to fight over them. Not good on a date night sort of excursion...) 10 or 12 different flights of wine available. It wasn't priced that I'd go on a regular basis like the joint on the corner but it also wasn't too expensive, just a special night out.
This place seems like it would be great, but last time I was there, the server hassled me about modifying  a salad. I don't want goat cheese, I have a dairy allergy! Give us some vegan options and we'll come check it out again (especially on not as busy weeknights).
Great service.  Always very good and sometimes stellar food.  Long waits on weekend, but worth it.  Love their commitment to showing art, too.
The food here is amazing, and probably the reason why they can get away with so much unprofessional shenanigans when it comes to getting a table. I especially love the Brussels sprouts roasted in butter. I really think they should provide you with free bread to soak up all the leftover yummy sauces that get left on the plate, its so sad to see all that flavor go to waste. Go with a small group so you can easily wait comfortably inside the restaurant. Te reason for this is below. I have gone to this restaurant 4 times, however I have only eaten here twice. On a weekend night they have a really long wait so one time we got there and had to give them our phone number because the wait was over an hour, so we were going to hang out at a bar next door. Well over an hour past, so we walked back into the restaurant. They said that they gave away our table because we weren't there. I said "but you asked for our phone number so you would call us when our table was ready". She then changed her story saying she did call us. This was not true since there was no record on either of our phones of such a missed phone call. She then proceeded to tell us that the wait would now be over another hour. We said no thanks, and ate elsewhere. Basically if you want a table make sure to stay in their restaurant at all times, because even though they say they will call you, they won't.
Recently, they seem to have had a change in the kitchen staff and the "interestingness" and quality of dishes has dropped noticeably. They lost their mojo. Otherwise, it is generally a decent place to have a casual meal. Normally, I would give it 4 stars for its cutting edge originality and very attentive wait staff. If they fix the back room issue, it will be outstanding again. For those of you who are not familiar with the place, its rather unconventional. It's usually fully packed and highly informal atmosphere. You MUST arrive at 5:20 to wait outside and get a table. They're strangely fanatical about NOT opening their doors until 5:30 on the nose. Dishes arrive when completed rather that all at once. The wait staff is VERY attentive and provide excellent service given their scheme. If you're coming from "downstate" you will probably find the J-A-T scheme to be irritating and unsavory. My advice, relax and enjoy interesting combinations of food cooked with FRESH ingredients in a casual atmosphere. No downstate cologne/perfume-wearing uptight wait staff. You can wear sweatpans, ski clothes or a suit. The wine selection is merely average, and as such typically results in some bad ones and some OK ones. Never really exceptional, but mostly passable and fun to try in their various tasting "flights". If you truly like food and an honest food experience, try it and you will not be displeased. Depending in who is in the back, you may even be "wowed".
Being around the neighborhood, decided to try this place because of G. I wanted to go some place else which probably would have turn out better. I love tapas but considering my recent several days of indulgence we were conservative and chosen 5 dishes and a dessert. So the good: the asparagus was a little bit on the salty side but it was delicious. Then the portobello "sausage" was inventive and the best of the five dishes we ordered. The lamb chop lacked flavor, so did the shrimp sauteed, and the fish - forgot which one - was unmemorable. I was extremely happy with the dessert and the coffee though. I had the bread pudding and it was so good with homemade caramel and whipped cream and this is coming from someone who doesn't have a sweet tooth. I love coffee on the other hand and it was strong and it paired perfectly with the bread pudding. I need to find a recipe for bread pudding now...
I love Just A Taste!!  But they need to be bigger.  It's a small cozy restaurant with great atmosphere. However, definitely call ahead to make reservations. Variety of great tapas and wonderful wines by the flight (5 samples in a variety of themes, or you can mix and match!) glass, and bottle.  They also have a full bar too.  The menu and wine list are ever changing, and always spectacular.  Great emphasis on local and fresh ingredients too!  They also have outdoor seating at their back patio in the warm months. Must go, great for dates and small groups, but call ahead first!
If you haven't been here, you must give it a try.  We went on Friday night, and boy, it was packed!  You know that's a good sign.  Ambiance wise, nothing special, but the food is very good and very solid. For 3 ppl, we had just about everything on the menu. - Mixed Imported Olives - Deep Fried Russet Potato Wedges with Chipotle Aioli - yum - White and Portabella Mushrooms Sautéed with Garlic and Thyme - Garlic Braised Greens with Walnuts, Tomatoes, Sherry Vinegar and Point Reyes Blue Cheese - Spicy Shrimp Sauté with Tomato, Jalapeno, Onions, Lime and Cilantro - Seared Salmon with Fried Papadom and Spicy Cumber Raita - Seared tuna - yum - Lamb - and some other vegetables I can't remember Wine wasn't that great.  Had the local flight - liked the red best, nothing else really stood out.  The sangria was ok, nothing special. The food was well prepared, and the potato wedges were so good we ordered a second order.  seared tuna was outstanding as well.  Food was flavorful, though presentation wasn't really their thing, but I guess you can't have everything. One thing though, the bill does add up.  I mean, we ate a ton of food, but the meat course (tuna, lamb, shrimp) - all around $6 - 10, and portion size definitely lacking, but I guess that's the nature of a tapas place.
I've only been here once but I loved it.  Definitely try a wine flight.  My favorite tapas were the brussel sprouts (I know, I was skeptical too) and the salt cod fritters.
My partner and I went to dine there on a Saturday night, what turned out to be Parent's Weekend for Ithaca College. Needless to say, it was a busy night, even though we got there early (6 pm). But, because tapas bars are delightful, and seemingly hard to come by around these parts, we put our names on the list, and strolled over to one of the nearby used bookstores and waited it out (even though the estimated wait time was 1 to 2 hours, the hostess was kind enough to take a cell phone number and called us when a table was ready. We waited about 45 minutes total, and the bookstores in the area are wonderful, so it was a pleasant wait). The menus are printed fresh every day, so I assumed that everything was prepared with fresh ingredients. At the bottom of the menu they list the farms where the food came from - great for those insistent on eating and buying locally, or even just those who care about where their food comes from. My partner and I ordered the Linguisa sausage with brocolli and Flageolet bean salad, chicken with basmati rice, seared mahi mahi with chile salsa, a small salad, and the Italian wine flights. We ended with the apple-blueberry crisp. The chicken came first, and it was delish! Chicken can be surprisingly dull if not done right, but this was perfect; so juicy and tender, and the rice was soaked in broth. It came in a fairly large bowl, considering tapas portions, so we were also pleasantly surprised. The sausage was AMAZING. Just amazing. So good that I tried to think of all sorts of wild ways to describe how good it is (some involving the word "orgasmic"), but I am left literally too stupid for words. That's how good it was. I would definitely get it again and would definitely recommend it. The mahi mahi came last and was also impeccably prepared. The fish was seared to perfection, crispy on the outside, tender and soft on the inside. The chili/corn salsa on top was a wonderful compliment to the fish. The apple-blueberry crisp was our final indulgence. We didn't regret it, it was a sweet conclusion to a wonderful date. Overall presentation was great, portions a little small considering how delicious everything was. The wine flights were OK, a little expensive. If you're planning on getting a lot of food I would recommend skipping the wine and indulging in as much of the food as your wallet can handle, because it is definitely worth it. For our meal, we ended up spending something like $53, including tip. Definitely more than we usually spend when dining out together, but we left feeling very happy about it and would probably do it again (though, not until next month, haha).
Just a Taste is by far my favorite restaurant in Ithaca. I have never had a bad meal there. The potato wedges are always great, and the cod fritters are to die for! Always the place to go for a fabulous meal and great wine!!
Get there as early or as late as possible. This place is popular so it fills up really fast on a busy night, which is practically all nights. We got there like 20 minutes after it opened and there were already no seats - I sat at the bar. I've been to Spain 5 times and whenever I came back I would always say why doesn't the US adopt the kind of tapas  (or pintxos) - beer - and wine business model?! This places still doesn't do it but comes very close serving somewhat authentic spanish cuisine while providing a similar atmosphere to what can be found in Spain.   I ordered like 90 dollars worth of wine and tapa plates with my fiance and we enjoyed everything. The tortilla was authentic, sheep's head soup was awesome, chacuteree was decadent, brussel sprouts  were fun, potato gratin stuff was delicious, and the spanish wine flight was an awesome value (and tasty too), among several others. I was expecting terrible service based on what everyone else said. While the bar tender was not bursting with excitement and smiling nearly as much as us, she was certainly not providing terrible service. So in the end, no complaints in the service department for me. I guess the thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is the fact that I spent an amount of money that is nothing to sneeze at and still left completely willing to eat more.

I love tapas, because I love variety.  Just A Taste does variety extremely well. Their menu is always changing depending on what's in season, but it's all very good.  I've been several times, and the following menu items stand out: - flatbread of the day - Brussels sprouts - sautéed garlic greens - sautéed mushrooms (sometimes over salted) - shrimp (however it's prepared, it's always sweet and succulent) I always get a wine flight (again, variety) since there's a nice healthy tasting of each wine.  More bang for your buck!  Tapas can be on the pricey side, especially here, so it's important to make your green stretch when you can.  I definitely recommend sharing a few plates between friends!  Oh, and be prepared to wait.
Not a restaurant, an experience. I love the wine flights, a sampling of 5-6 small glasses of different wines. The place is great for sharing tapas and conversation. In the summer, their backyard patio is a perfect little hideaway, with nice foilage, and small bistro tables. The food is consistently fresh and good. Eclectic selections vary weekly. Can be busy, get there early or be patient.
This place was recommended to us, and we recommend it to you. We ordered at least a dozen dishes to share, not one was sub-par. The Shepard's Pie was exquisite, and authentic. You can get wine flights too. Lovely dinner overall.
Would not go here again. It really is 'Just a Taste.' We ordered a spinach salad, some mushrooms, lamb, and I forgot the other thing. The food was simply mediocre. There was nothing special about it and it's very expensive for such a small morsel of food. We were very very hungry afterwards. Would never go again!
'Just A Taste' is a cute/little Tapas bar in downtown Ithaca. We went on a Friday night, they don't except reservations (except during the Cornell and Ithaca College graduation weekends).  The wait  to be seated was about 1/2 hour (we went next door to the Mahogany Grill bar to have a drink in the meantime). As for the tapas bar,  I would recommend trying to get seated in the backyard courtyard in the summer time, good ambiance at night time. For wine, they offer by the glass, wine flights or by the bottle. We got a bottle from the Rioja valley  (reasonable price) but in hindsight, we should of gotten a wine flight instead, it's a lot more fun.  As for the food, a few of the dishes we got were a little 'unflavorable' while others were delicious!  (that's the beauty of Tappas, just go for it and order a bunch of dishes).   A few items we liked: -  'Summer Squash' sautéed in Brown Butter with Garlic, Pecans and Romano cheese. -  'Shaved Prosciutto with Peaches and Arugula'  in smoked Onion Vinaigrette. - Grilled Flank Steak' with Citrus Slaw and BBQ sauce. The server was nice, proficient, our water glasses were constantly refreshed. We would return again.
Went here last night for a girls night with several co-workers. We ordered a HUGE array of items from the menu and not a single one was a disappointment! The Warm brie and melon was melty, delectable, yumminess!! We had chicken braised in coconut milk hot wings with a coconut basil sweet and spicy sauce, brown sugar cured goat belly, brown butter squash with pecans, and a ton of other dishes! We were stuffed and satisfied!! Then we started contemplating dessert... we were absolutely too full for another bite... yet we ended up ordering one of every dessert on the menu and they were even better than the meal!! This place is a definite gem!!! The only downside was that to get to the outdoor seating, you are taken on a walk through the "guts" of the building, passing bathrooms, kitchen, cleaning buckets, etc... before coming back out into the sunshine. But the food whisked that memory from my mind in no time at all!
This restaurant is worth checking out for the wine flights alone!  What a great way to refine one's palate.  Most of the wine I drank there was fantastic!  We had dinner as well and sampled several of their food items.  My favorite dish was the Tortilla Espaniola.  We also enjoyed the steamed clams.   Our server was very knowledgeable and helpful.  The decor inside was nice, although after catching a glimpse of the patio outback, I think that may have been the better option.  This is definitely a fine place for a meal and some wine in Ithaca.
BEST DINNER IN TOWN. Every time. Every food item is just so great. The potato wedges with chipotle aioli - SO AWESOME, the flank steak - OF COURSE, don't even get us started on the ROASTED GARLIC with foccacia, and man oh man the brussel sprouts with romano and pecans!! We never thought we'd be raving about brussel sprouts! AND THE CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE we almost died. Especially because we tried to eat everything on the menu because it's all so good which led to three hour long food comas. And that's not even getting into the wine selection, which is awesome (even though we do not know much about wines, we do know that all the wines we've had at Just A Taste have been so so good). The service is great, they bring the first item out so fast, and then just keep bringing them, until you are swimming in tapas heaven. Nothing bad to say about Just A Taste, except for the fact that it is TOO good.
Our meal on a recent Tuesday night was very well done and all 6 of us enjoyed the meal. We tried an assortment of both vegetable and meat dishes. Our favorites were the pork loin and the shrimp. Our 11 yr old son enjoy the Salt Cod Fritters too. The patio out back was very crowded all night. I'd definitely go back.
Stopped through Ithaca while helping our daughter move -- we were hot, sweaty, hungry, and maybe just a little giddy with fatigue.  It was a good meal and we had fun, but there is definitely room for improvement in what other reviewers claim is the best restaurant in town... This is one of those times i wish I could give separate ratings, and use half stars, for the food (4), the atmosphere (3.5), and the service (3).  Overall, I'd give it a 3.5 if I could. We were seated right away in the nice little patio in back of the restaurant, where we waited a seemingly unreasonable amount of time before anyone offered us drinks and took our order.  I swear that the three servers purposefully looked away when passing our table, which was quite close to the door... (unsolicited advice: If you want to sit back there -- and it is *nice* on a warm summer night -- I recommend squinting your eyes as tightly as possible as your waiter leads you through the less-than-clean hallway to the back so you don't loose your appetite...but not so tightly that you risk brushing up against the nasty ole' walls...) (note to management: if you clean up that scary hallway and the bathroom walls, I would give you 4 stars.  It was that bad.  I rarely give that much weight to atmosphere, especially in non-essential parts of the facility, but c'mon, people!) But once the orders were taken (oh, about 2 days later.  it may have been less.  hard to tell. we were really hungry), the dishes came out quickly and the server was much more attentive. Here is my summary: Vegetables, good!  Meat...not so much, really. Of the 7 or so little dishes we ordered, I have to say that I loved the Caesar salad and the summer squash the best.  One of the best I've had anywhere, the Caesar has a nice balance of the tart lemon and bright garlic, a touch of the salty anchovy (but not too much!), and just the right level of creaminess without being too heavy -- and the whole romaine leaves were oh-so- fresh.  I asked for anchovies and was quickly delivered 4 tasty little fishies. The summer squash in brown butter sauce with pecans sounds so deceptively simple and plain, but was so gosh-darn good I could have eaten a potful and then licked the pot.  The sauce had a depth I cannot explain.  Something more than brown butter is going on in there.  It makes me want to subscribe to an overpriced foodie magazine from whom I can request and get the restaurant's recipe... We landed up ordering seconds of both of those dishes. My friend's salad with baby greens and goat cheese was lovely.  Excellent goat cheese -- I mean, better than usual.  They do seem to go for really fresh and quality produce here. The brie with melon, of course, was so good, but really, how can one screw up melted brie?  The melon was nice and sweet and fresh, but I could have used 2 more of those very thin, almost transparent slices.  Again, evidence of picking really fine products and produce for their dishes. Meatballs with couscous and mint yoghurt was extremely underwhelming.  Too dry. The Madeira sauce that came with the sauteed chicken breast and potatoes was quite good...but some of the chicken pieces, like the meatballs, were a bit overcooked.  Why, oh why will I never remember to *not* order the chicken!?!?! The scallop half of our mussels-and-scallop dish was excellent.  A few of the mussels, sadly, were a bit skunky, and my husband claimed the smoked paprika and tomato broth that it came in smelled like a barn.  (But he says this about a lot of things, actually.)  I thought it smelled faintly like could-be-fresher sea food, but it tasted okay. My husband ordered the bread pudding, but I can't tell you about it because he ate it so quickly I never got a bite -- I was finishing up my second Caesar salad... There were lots of other dishes I would love to try, and despite rating it 3 stars, I will go back because it is, rumor has it, the best place in town.
The best food in a hundred mile radius. Forget John Thomas, this stuff is creative and great to eat with friends, which is what college is all about (I know, I know, Ithaca is not all about college kids, but we all enjoy eating with friends, right?). Plus, I love that they do flights-- like tapas for wine, which is so appropriate when you have 10 dishes on the table. Plus, in the brief window of time that weather works out, the back patio is divine and twinkly. Cute waitresses, nice people, and a place you can spend hours eating. A nice refuge from Collegetown. The one place I hit up every time I'm in Ithaca.
If you're obsessed with removing crumbs from your dinner table then be prepared for an evening of anxiety and frustration.  For some reason, Just A Taste fails to use tablecloths.  The tabletops are formica-ed and patterned with motes (is that a crumb?) and over the years have become gouged (is that a crumb?) by the frantic stabs of customers searching for more food.  Okay, I realize that tapas are appetizer portions and the whole point is to order a bunch and sit back and sample and talk and impress everybody with your spot-on pronunciations of "gruyere" and "charmoula" and "achiote".  But still, my date and I had to order 7 tapas and dessert before we even felt remotely full.  Did somebody say gluttony?  I know, I know, it's a deadly sin but so is lust and l can assure you that lust was not practiced that night. Because here is my point.  The food at Just A Taste is fantastic.  The space inspires claustrophobia, the service is indifferent at best, and the flatware follows the lead of the tabletops.  But the food, the food glorious food, is worth it.  Before you know it you'll have eaten like a starving orphan and be too sluggish to consummate the event that made you ask her out in the first place. My advice - save Just A Taste for one of those group dinners with all your friends.
BEST restaurant in the area.  LOVE LOVE LOVE. Great food, good service, even better wine selection.
There's a back story to this exemplary review: Just a Taste is where my now long-time girlfriend and I went on our first date. That first visit, we were both so excited, nervous, and talkative that we forgot to eat, which is a shame because in my opinion JaT has the best food Ithaca has to offer. Since then, we've come here about once every month to celebrate small life victories and special occasions ("The sun came out in Ithaca today! Let's go to JaT!"). We've come to know the menu up and down, though items do change occasionally or an old favorite gets re-invented. Everything on the menu is excellent. The flank steak is one of our favorites, as is the sauteed spicy shrimp dish. But we don't kid ourselves: it's really the deep fried russet potato wedges with chipotle aioli that keep us coming back. We're relatively poor students and I'm a long-distance runner, so we think nothing of ordering more carbs like the mouth-watering focaccia (which is also great to dip in the leftover aioli) or the tortilla espanola. So tasty. Beverages? Dessert? The wine flights and the occasional dessert do the trick and are reasonably priced: we order these "add-ons" only for very special occasions, but we've always been pleased when we do. Service is adequate and the staff are always friendly, though food is often airdropped in like it's Operation Market Garden. The decor is fun: we have several games/activities to play at Just a Taste. The first one is "Which plate am I am going to get?". This one requires my gf and I to pick which of the two kitchy and non-matching plates we'd like to use. Another one is to see if the artwork has changed since we came last. Unfortunately, there's also the game of "how long do you think we'll have to wait to get in tonight?" that we play every time we want to head here, but any wait is worth it in the long run. I can't recommend Just a Taste enough, especially for college aged guys looking to actually be classy and take their significant other or romantic interest on a date to this fun, delicious, and (depending on what you order) reasonably priced tapas restaurant. Bravo!
Im new to Ithaca and Im having a hard time trusting yelpers on the east coast after going here haha. This has happened a few times now. FOURS STARS? really? Cons: The salad was the best part of the 5-6 dishes we ordered.  I filled myself up with bread and salad the whole time. The place was really packed. Pros: The wine selection is DELICIOUS.  We did the "local flight" where you can try 5 local wines
Based on the positive reviews, my wife and I stopped in for a Saturday lunch. Fantastic. So many delicious items on the menu, it was difficult to choose. We started with the Housemade Focaccia with Roast Garlic. Bread lovers beware - their Focaccia is crazy good.  I got the Quail stuffed with bacon and mushrooms on a bed of chedder grits. My wife got a sandwich on Focaccia that was a potato/cheese thing - i forget the name. Also delicious. We weren't ready for midday wine, so we'll definitely have to go back for that. Their wine selection was great.  Many people were ordering flights, and they looked really tasty. They also have a wide variety of beers (4 draft, 12+ in bottles). The decor is what robbed Just A Taste of 5 stars. When the food is this good, I like to see a little effort go into the design of the restaurant. The art on the wall was mildly interesting, but the space was very bland. The tables/floor combo made me feel like it was in a cafeteria. So much could be done with this place. It's a shame to see wasted potential. Also, our waitress was really really slow. Sometimes slow is a good thing, and we didn't mind terribly, but had we been in a rush, it would have not been pretty. But the food cannot be beat. For that alone, everyone should try this place. SO YUMMY!
Looking for good tapas and wine in Ithaca, New York? Then Just a Taste is the place to be. This casual little restaurant serves up delicious tapas from a rotating menu, keeping dining experiences interesting and innovative. They also use products from local farms. Yay for fresh foods and community love. Anyway, the last time I went, two friends and I were able to get a seat for 3 without much of a wait (however, it gets busy quick, so I suggest you go early!) We started off with the seared scallops in chili-lime butter with daikon salsa and sticky rice. The scallops had a beautiful sear on the outside with a well-cooked, tender flesh. The sticky rice was flavorful and texturally on key, with a nice play of tart and spice in the daikon salsa. Next, we enjoyed local brussel sprouts sautéed in brown butter with garlic, pecans, and Romano cheese. Crispy from the saute with melted garlic and cheese and nutty accents... need I say more? The garlic braised greens with tomatoes, walnuts, stilton blue cheese, and sherry vinegar--a Just a Taste classic--was amazing. I never thought braised greens could make a lady swoon, but these decadent flavors had me charmed. Clams steamed in white wine with lemon, onions, garlic, tomatoes, and bay leaves came next. The clams were plump & juicy, oozing umami juices, so the garlic and onions balanced out the dish nicely. Next came the eggplant braised in coconut curry, fried papadam, cilantro, lime, goat cheese, and pomegranate seeds. The papadam--a crispy Indian flatbread--was great for picking up the curried eggplant, and the pomegranate seeds offered a whimsical pop of sweet and tart. The five spice pork belly with sautéed Chinese cabbage and snow peas and sweet soy blew was the only thing I didn't inhale. These thick, tender hunks of pork belly were lightly seasoned served on a bed of sauteed Chinese cabbage and snow peas. Nothing on the dish really worked in harmony, and it just seemed like a ingredients thrown together. BUT, don't let that stop you from checking on Just a Taste. If you read any of the descriptions above, you should already be on your way.
I went to Just A Taste after reading such informative reviews from the lovely Yelpers below. Thankfully, I knew what to expect: great food, spotty service, an unremarkable interior, and a long wait. We arrived around 7, were told it would take about an hour for a table, gave our cell phone number, and went for a walk. About 45 minutes later, we got a call that our table was ready, and headed over to find an old, rickety, bare table with glasses of water and menus already laid out for us. After looking over the menu of tapas-style New American food, we decided on: 1. Warm brie with melon and crostini 2. Tortilla Española of eggs, onion, and potato with garlic aioli and mixed greens 3. Pork with bacon-ragout and soft polenta 4. Pan-fried mackerel with spinach in a garlic and butter sauce Everything exceeded our expectations. The brie, melon, and crostini was the simplest dish and absolutely delicious. The Tortilla Española was like a dense crustless quiche and went incredibly well with the aioli and the salad. The pork was a thin cutlet with polenta and ragout layered on top. The textures and flavors were so interesting and delightful. The mackerel wasn't what we were expecting, but it was really good, too. Since mackerel is such an oily fish, it doesn't need butter or sauce. The flavor of the sauce was delicious, but masked the mackerel flavor maybe a little too much. The portions were small, but not too small. We probably could have had another portion or two, but decided to leave some space for dessert. We had: 5. Almond-poppyseed turnovers with vanilla creme anglese and orange slices 6. Chocolate lava cake with chocolate sauce Oh, boy! The turnovers were my favorite. When all the elements were combined, it was like eating an orange-poppyseed scone, which I love. Yum! All in all, this place is worth going to, as long as you know in advance that the wait will take forever and the service and atmosphere leave much to be desired. The food is outstanding!
Just a Taste is one of Ithaca's most popular dining spots, and with good reason. It's incredibly affordable, and the food and wine are consistently good. Did I mention affordable?   The overall menu doesn't change too frequently, but that's okay because it's easy to know what to order. Don't miss the freshly made foccacia bread with roasted garlic and olive oil or the russet potato wedges with chipotle aioli. When the Brussels sprouts are in season, they're also well worth a try.  They're perfectly roasted and topped with freshly grated Parmesan.   The only downside is that they don't take reservations and it gets crazy busy, so arriving when it opens is a good tactic if you're dying to eat there.
One of my favorite restaurants in Ithaca. The small plates are perfect for sharing and trying a bunch of dishes.  The dishes change frequently enough that you can try new things, but some staples are always on the menu.  Good date spot  - sit at a small table and share food :) My favorites are: - hot brie with melon and bread - potato wedges - baked garlic - sauteed mushrooms - sauteed shrimp
My boyfriend and I visited over the weekend for dinner; it was literally the only restaurant that had any business in the Commons. Tapas were decently priced and good portions and overall pretty good. We ordered the shrimp saute, flatbread, brussel sprouts, pork loin, and the flank steak. But I believe that the menu has slight changes every night because our menu had a date on it. Just a warning: there is garlic in literally EVERY dish. The shrimp saute was probably my favorite dish. The brussel sprouts were decent and tasted good! The pork loin was very salty and hard to chew. The flank was undercooked. And I don't recommend the flatbread at all; it is very bland, but it's a very big dish. The dinner came out to be around $45 for dinner for two, which was much less than what we were expecting. I was full from dinner (which never happens with tapas!) but my boyfriend wasn't. But we both agreed that they gave pretty big portions for tapas and I don't think tapas are meant for people who are looking for a full meal. I definitely recommend the place!
In my opinion, this is the best restaurant in Ithaca. I've been twice, and it was great both times. The brussels sprouts are a pretty memorable dish for me. Really garlicy, salty, and mixed with pecan nuts. Damn good. Solid wine list as well. If only they accepted reservations, life would be a lot easier. However the place is rammed most nights, so it's understandable that they don't.
One of the best meals of my life. The half hour wait was worth it. Everything was good and some plates exceptional. Favorites included the warm brie with melon, fried salt cod (surprising, delicious texture) and the local lamb with mushrooms, onions and peppers.  Spanish wine flight for $13.50 includes 5 healthy half (2/3ish) glasses of delightful varied cheap wines.   Summer squash with brown butter, garlic and walnuts was great but didn't have enough walnuts so the balance was off. Dessert:  omg I'm a happy fatty. Good coffee. Peach rhubarb Betty was like a good hug. homie, warm, flavourful and not too sweet, topped with deelish whipped cream. Cheese pie was friggin amazing. I've never had something that tasted like sweet cheese. Sounds kind of gross actually, but the cheese pie was dynomite.  Think:  fluffy cheesecake that tastes subtley like bonbelle original. In short:  go here. Go here and gorge on a delicious varied selection of epicurean delights. Don't look at any more reviews,  just go here.
Man, I really wish we had this joint in the city! The tapas are SO moderately priced (when was the last time you paid $9 for a plate of 3 seared scallops?) and delicious, plus service was wonderful. We were seated at the bar and had a friendly bartender willing to answer our questions (bonus, she looked like she actually enjoyed her job) about the food and beer. Out of 6 plates that we ordered (scallops, spicy shrimp, cheese plate, eggplant focaccia, meatballs, and zucchini with browned butter), there were maybe only 2 that I could've done without. The seafood and meatballs were cooked well: not too dry, not undercooked either. The cheese plate only had 2 different types of cheese however, as opposed to the typical 3, but whatever, they were good. The eggplant focaccia and zucchini were ehhh...I just felt that they were too acidic for me, but not completely awful to the point where we didn't eat all of it. Next time I'm up in this area, this will definitely be a dinner spot!
Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Ithaca. There are a few reasons for this: 1 - the food itself is really excellent...the combinations of flavors are out of this world and most of the dishes I've tried reflect this 2 - about half of the menu changes daily but there are still the same proportions of each type of food (i.e. chicken, seafood, vegetarian, etc) - basically it's just the preparation that changes some way 3 - it's a good place to go with people with varying tastes and who are into different types of food. Just a Taste will satisfy vegans and meat lovers alike. Some of my favorite dishes: Focaccia with roast garlic - one of my favorite things to share with the table (although secretly i wish i could eat the whole thing). Definitely a crowd pleaser Deep fried russett potato wedges - again a dish that everybody loves. I haven't had any complaints yet! Chocolate souffle for dessert - to die for! So rich and decadent, if you go you need to have this Those are just a few of my favorites, but even though I like meat, their vegetarian dishes are also very good and different. I also enjoy the wine flights. They average between 8 and 12 dollars for a flight of 5 different wines. They have the flights divided up into different categories and the selection seems to change often.
Came here again tonight with the fam. Quality of the food wasn't as good and service was a bit rushed. Understandable though, since it was very crowded and the waiting line was only getting longer. Local Butternut Squash Sautéed in Brown Butter with Garlic, Pecans and Romano Cheese -Awesome! This dish is just addictive. In the wintertime, they substitute the local butternut squash with brussel sprouts, and that dish is my fave. Focaccia Bread was not as fresh today, but still good. Roasted Garlic was perfect. Spicy Shrimp Sauté with Tomato, Jalapeno, Onions, Lime and Cilantro, $6.25. -Shrimp was overcooked. Not impressed. Deep Fried Russet Potato Wedges with Chipotle Aioli: This never fails to satisfy! HUGE potato wedges with yummy chipotle aioli. I'll get this again and again. Tiramisu: Espresso-madeira soaked sponge cake with sabayon cream, chocolate shavings, and cocoa, $5 Surprisingly very good! Not a traditional recipe, but very good nonetheless, a perfect way to end a meal. I'd definitely get this again. The sponge cake had a pleasant nutty texture and was throughly soaked. Om nom! I was very pleased.
I was just visiting the campus and some friends, so I'm not a local. There was a long line and my friend recommended that we try it. I love tapas! It's a great way to try many dishes to get to know the chef and how (s)he utilizes local produce and ingredients. Overall the food was good, but presentation was somewhat lacking. It was very crowded, because it was the day students were coming back to school. I liked that they had wine samplers. I had the Reds flight - all were good, especially the one from France.
One of our all time favorites in Ithaca. First, it is hard to get a table because there is a long wait list, because its so popular. But one you sit down, you are drenched with the sounds of conversation, delicious smells and a large selection of wine. We have gotten a number of wine flights, and they have papers to explain it all to you. We could literally spend hours in there eating and drinking. All of the food is incredible and the wait staff couldn't be nicer.
Pretty good food, and good service too. I came here late at night to grab a quick bite and drink with a friend, and the duck leg/mussels were surprisingly fresh. The duck leg wasn't marinated as well as it should have been, but it was tender and cooked well. Mussels were fresh, what more can I say? Seems like a good place for tapas, with some nice wines. A nice option for late night in Ithaca.
Even though I've not had the privelege of eating at Just a Taste for some months (during which I've been at the other end of the United States), I can recall the excellence of the food and the helpfulness of the staff. I try to engage the waitstaff as much as possible (given the crowd that is typical, this can be difficult) so that I can glean any insight that might not be obvious from outside the kitchen. The first time I went, the gentleman was kind enough to suggest agreeable wines and portions for the company. When the food arrived, talking practically ceased. The flavors were excellent, the presentation suitable, and the experience as a whole came together beautifully. I'm glad to say that I've been back and I'll continue to visit this establishment when time and location provide for such opportunity.
Every dish we had here was great.  I'm not sure you can go wrong with any item on the menu.  The wait staff was friendly and approachable and made sure we were satisfied before the kitchen closed for the night.  The dessert was just as good as the main courses. I will highly recommend this to all friends visiting Ithaca and make plans to be back next time I find myself in town!
Amazing, just amazing. Tapas and great wine, two of my favorite things. The menu rotates all the time, but there are some favorites that always stay on there, such as the foccacia, the duck plates, and there's usually some lamb (which I highly recommend). It's owned by the same guy who owns Madeline's and Zaza's. The wine list is great, but I was slightly disappointed with the Big Red Flight. They also serve ales like Lindeman's Framboise. Call ahead; they don't accept reservations and the wait is generally really long. Or just go have a beer at Korova around the corner.
This place seems like it would be great, but last time I was there, the server hassled me about modifying  a salad. I don't want goat cheese, I have a dairy allergy! Give us some vegan options and we'll come check it out again (especially on not as busy weeknights).
Just A Taste is one of the places on my list that I eat at when I come back to Ithaca. The food is always simple concepts with excellent flavors. I love the wine flights-especially the local flight! And I like the hustle and bustle, crowded atmosphere. I feel like I am back in Europe, and enjoy making the effort to have my dining companions hear me above the bustling din. I have staples that I always order here: Fried Russet Potatoes with chipotle aoli. Amazing and spicy! Foccicia with a Whole Roasted Garlic Blub. Delicious dunked in some Oliver oil. And then I usually order a smatter of other items. On this particular visit my sister and I tried the Carmelized Brussel Sprouts-YUM! and  the Shrimp sauteed in Garlic and Sherry-probably wouldn't order that again; and the Brie and Apple Plate-very generous portions of brie! It's been a while since I have had dessert there-but if my memory serves me right, it shouldn't be passed up too often. I only wish Boulder, Colorado had a place like Just A Taste, I'd be a regular.
The food here is amazing, and probably the reason why they can get away with so much unprofessional shenanigans when it comes to getting a table. I especially love the Brussels sprouts roasted in butter. I really think they should provide you with free bread to soak up all the leftover yummy sauces that get left on the plate, its so sad to see all that flavor go to waste. Go with a small group so you can easily wait comfortably inside the restaurant. Te reason for this is below. I have gone to this restaurant 4 times, however I have only eaten here twice. On a weekend night they have a really long wait so one time we got there and had to give them our phone number because the wait was over an hour, so we were going to hang out at a bar next door. Well over an hour past, so we walked back into the restaurant. They said that they gave away our table because we weren't there. I said "but you asked for our phone number so you would call us when our table was ready". She then changed her story saying she did call us. This was not true since there was no record on either of our phones of such a missed phone call. She then proceeded to tell us that the wait would now be over another hour. We said no thanks, and ate elsewhere. Basically if you want a table make sure to stay in their restaurant at all times, because even though they say they will call you, they won't.
Having done a little Yelp research, I of course came up with a list of the top restaurants, not places, that I wanted to try with my boyfriend. On our last night, my boyfriend, who is an incoming graduate student, and I headed towards E. Seneca Street and North Aurora Street looking for the restaurant  after hiking the hills all day. What we saw when we got there was a cozy little shop filled to the brim and more with people. People sitting, people carrying trays quickly to serve, people tapping their feet inpatiently and waiting for a seat... just lots and lots of people. This was sort of surprising and a good sign, considering how small the city is. The wait ended up being nearly 45 minutes long and in good time too as we almost decided to go to another restaurant. We found ourselves seated fairly quickly by the windows and were instantly waited on by a friendly server. We ordered four dishes (which came in the order that I am listing them here)-- 1) the brie, apple, and crostini; 2) the sautéed chicken breast with potatoes and onion in a madeira sauce; 3) the steamed clams with andouille sausage and pickled onions in a tomato broth; and 4) the braised duck leg with prunes in a madeira-orange juice sauce. Out of the dishes, the brie, apple, and crostini stole the show. The combination of the smooth, creamy cheese with the crunchy bite of a sweet apple on a nicely toasted bread was very delightful. I was surprised by the amount of  cheese offered, as there was a huge melted chunk. I wish that they didn't skimp out so much on the bread and apple slices (but it's ok because my boyfriend can have a lot more cheese than I can). Either way we ate that plate clean and enjoyed it thoroughly. When the other dishes came out one by one and we tried every single one, we discovered that each had its own delightful flavors and texture. Though they were good, I wouldn't necessarily say it was the best thing I have ever eaten. Plus, the sangria was kind of too carbonated for my own taste and lack the punch and sweetness that I generally associate with it. Overall, it is a nice place to eat. If you asked me if I would wait another 45 minutes to go again, I most certainly wouldn't. I think this place is overhyped a bit, but nevertheless food is good and price is decent.
Being around the neighborhood, decided to try this place because of G. I wanted to go some place else which probably would have turn out better. I love tapas but considering my recent several days of indulgence we were conservative and chosen 5 dishes and a dessert. So the good: the asparagus was a little bit on the salty side but it was delicious. Then the portobello "sausage" was inventive and the best of the five dishes we ordered. The lamb chop lacked flavor, so did the shrimp sauteed, and the fish - forgot which one - was unmemorable. I was extremely happy with the dessert and the coffee though. I had the bread pudding and it was so good with homemade caramel and whipped cream and this is coming from someone who doesn't have a sweet tooth. I love coffee on the other hand and it was strong and it paired perfectly with the bread pudding. I need to find a recipe for bread pudding now...
If you haven't been here, you must give it a try.  We went on Friday night, and boy, it was packed!  You know that's a good sign.  Ambiance wise, nothing special, but the food is very good and very solid. For 3 ppl, we had just about everything on the menu. - Mixed Imported Olives - Deep Fried Russet Potato Wedges with Chipotle Aioli - yum - White and Portabella Mushrooms Sautéed with Garlic and Thyme - Garlic Braised Greens with Walnuts, Tomatoes, Sherry Vinegar and Point Reyes Blue Cheese - Spicy Shrimp Sauté with Tomato, Jalapeno, Onions, Lime and Cilantro - Seared Salmon with Fried Papadom and Spicy Cumber Raita - Seared tuna - yum - Lamb - and some other vegetables I can't remember Wine wasn't that great.  Had the local flight - liked the red best, nothing else really stood out.  The sangria was ok, nothing special. The food was well prepared, and the potato wedges were so good we ordered a second order.  seared tuna was outstanding as well.  Food was flavorful, though presentation wasn't really their thing, but I guess you can't have everything. One thing though, the bill does add up.  I mean, we ate a ton of food, but the meat course (tuna, lamb, shrimp) - all around $6 - 10, and portion size definitely lacking, but I guess that's the nature of a tapas place.
My partner and I went to dine there on a Saturday night, what turned out to be Parent's Weekend for Ithaca College. Needless to say, it was a busy night, even though we got there early (6 pm). But, because tapas bars are delightful, and seemingly hard to come by around these parts, we put our names on the list, and strolled over to one of the nearby used bookstores and waited it out (even though the estimated wait time was 1 to 2 hours, the hostess was kind enough to take a cell phone number and called us when a table was ready. We waited about 45 minutes total, and the bookstores in the area are wonderful, so it was a pleasant wait). The menus are printed fresh every day, so I assumed that everything was prepared with fresh ingredients. At the bottom of the menu they list the farms where the food came from - great for those insistent on eating and buying locally, or even just those who care about where their food comes from. My partner and I ordered the Linguisa sausage with brocolli and Flageolet bean salad, chicken with basmati rice, seared mahi mahi with chile salsa, a small salad, and the Italian wine flights. We ended with the apple-blueberry crisp. The chicken came first, and it was delish! Chicken can be surprisingly dull if not done right, but this was perfect; so juicy and tender, and the rice was soaked in broth. It came in a fairly large bowl, considering tapas portions, so we were also pleasantly surprised. The sausage was AMAZING. Just amazing. So good that I tried to think of all sorts of wild ways to describe how good it is (some involving the word "orgasmic"), but I am left literally too stupid for words. That's how good it was. I would definitely get it again and would definitely recommend it. The mahi mahi came last and was also impeccably prepared. The fish was seared to perfection, crispy on the outside, tender and soft on the inside. The chili/corn salsa on top was a wonderful compliment to the fish. The apple-blueberry crisp was our final indulgence. We didn't regret it, it was a sweet conclusion to a wonderful date. Overall presentation was great, portions a little small considering how delicious everything was. The wine flights were OK, a little expensive. If you're planning on getting a lot of food I would recommend skipping the wine and indulging in as much of the food as your wallet can handle, because it is definitely worth it. For our meal, we ended up spending something like $53, including tip. Definitely more than we usually spend when dining out together, but we left feeling very happy about it and would probably do it again (though, not until next month, haha).
Get there as early or as late as possible. This place is popular so it fills up really fast on a busy night, which is practically all nights. We got there like 20 minutes after it opened and there were already no seats - I sat at the bar. I've been to Spain 5 times and whenever I came back I would always say why doesn't the US adopt the kind of tapas  (or pintxos) - beer - and wine business model?! This places still doesn't do it but comes very close serving somewhat authentic spanish cuisine while providing a similar atmosphere to what can be found in Spain.   I ordered like 90 dollars worth of wine and tapa plates with my fiance and we enjoyed everything. The tortilla was authentic, sheep's head soup was awesome, chacuteree was decadent, brussel sprouts  were fun, potato gratin stuff was delicious, and the spanish wine flight was an awesome value (and tasty too), among several others. I was expecting terrible service based on what everyone else said. While the bar tender was not bursting with excitement and smiling nearly as much as us, she was certainly not providing terrible service. So in the end, no complaints in the service department for me. I guess the thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is the fact that I spent an amount of money that is nothing to sneeze at and still left completely willing to eat more.
Not a restaurant, an experience. I love the wine flights, a sampling of 5-6 small glasses of different wines. The place is great for sharing tapas and conversation. In the summer, their backyard patio is a perfect little hideaway, with nice foilage, and small bistro tables. The food is consistently fresh and good. Eclectic selections vary weekly. Can be busy, get there early or be patient.
Would not go here again. It really is 'Just a Taste.' We ordered a spinach salad, some mushrooms, lamb, and I forgot the other thing. The food was simply mediocre. There was nothing special about it and it's very expensive for such a small morsel of food. We were very very hungry afterwards. Would never go again!
'Just A Taste' is a cute/little Tapas bar in downtown Ithaca. We went on a Friday night, they don't except reservations (except during the Cornell and Ithaca College graduation weekends).  The wait  to be seated was about 1/2 hour (we went next door to the Mahogany Grill bar to have a drink in the meantime). As for the tapas bar,  I would recommend trying to get seated in the backyard courtyard in the summer time, good ambiance at night time. For wine, they offer by the glass, wine flights or by the bottle. We got a bottle from the Rioja valley  (reasonable price) but in hindsight, we should of gotten a wine flight instead, it's a lot more fun.  As for the food, a few of the dishes we got were a little 'unflavorable' while others were delicious!  (that's the beauty of Tappas, just go for it and order a bunch of dishes).   A few items we liked: -  'Summer Squash' sautéed in Brown Butter with Garlic, Pecans and Romano cheese. -  'Shaved Prosciutto with Peaches and Arugula'  in smoked Onion Vinaigrette. - Grilled Flank Steak' with Citrus Slaw and BBQ sauce. The server was nice, proficient, our water glasses were constantly refreshed. We would return again.
This restaurant is worth checking out for the wine flights alone!  What a great way to refine one's palate.  Most of the wine I drank there was fantastic!  We had dinner as well and sampled several of their food items.  My favorite dish was the Tortilla Espaniola.  We also enjoyed the steamed clams.   Our server was very knowledgeable and helpful.  The decor inside was nice, although after catching a glimpse of the patio outback, I think that may have been the better option.  This is definitely a fine place for a meal and some wine in Ithaca.
Our meal on a recent Tuesday night was very well done and all 6 of us enjoyed the meal. We tried an assortment of both vegetable and meat dishes. Our favorites were the pork loin and the shrimp. Our 11 yr old son enjoy the Salt Cod Fritters too. The patio out back was very crowded all night. I'd definitely go back.
The best food in a hundred mile radius. Forget John Thomas, this stuff is creative and great to eat with friends, which is what college is all about (I know, I know, Ithaca is not all about college kids, but we all enjoy eating with friends, right?). Plus, I love that they do flights-- like tapas for wine, which is so appropriate when you have 10 dishes on the table. Plus, in the brief window of time that weather works out, the back patio is divine and twinkly. Cute waitresses, nice people, and a place you can spend hours eating. A nice refuge from Collegetown. The one place I hit up every time I'm in Ithaca.
BEST restaurant in the area.  LOVE LOVE LOVE. Great food, good service, even better wine selection.
Im new to Ithaca and Im having a hard time trusting yelpers on the east coast after going here haha. This has happened a few times now. FOURS STARS? really? Cons: The salad was the best part of the 5-6 dishes we ordered.  I filled myself up with bread and salad the whole time. The place was really packed. Pros: The wine selection is DELICIOUS.  We did the "local flight" where you can try 5 local wines
Looking for good tapas and wine in Ithaca, New York? Then Just a Taste is the place to be. This casual little restaurant serves up delicious tapas from a rotating menu, keeping dining experiences interesting and innovative. They also use products from local farms. Yay for fresh foods and community love. Anyway, the last time I went, two friends and I were able to get a seat for 3 without much of a wait (however, it gets busy quick, so I suggest you go early!) We started off with the seared scallops in chili-lime butter with daikon salsa and sticky rice. The scallops had a beautiful sear on the outside with a well-cooked, tender flesh. The sticky rice was flavorful and texturally on key, with a nice play of tart and spice in the daikon salsa. Next, we enjoyed local brussel sprouts sautéed in brown butter with garlic, pecans, and Romano cheese. Crispy from the saute with melted garlic and cheese and nutty accents... need I say more? The garlic braised greens with tomatoes, walnuts, stilton blue cheese, and sherry vinegar--a Just a Taste classic--was amazing. I never thought braised greens could make a lady swoon, but these decadent flavors had me charmed. Clams steamed in white wine with lemon, onions, garlic, tomatoes, and bay leaves came next. The clams were plump & juicy, oozing umami juices, so the garlic and onions balanced out the dish nicely. Next came the eggplant braised in coconut curry, fried papadam, cilantro, lime, goat cheese, and pomegranate seeds. The papadam--a crispy Indian flatbread--was great for picking up the curried eggplant, and the pomegranate seeds offered a whimsical pop of sweet and tart. The five spice pork belly with sautéed Chinese cabbage and snow peas and sweet soy blew was the only thing I didn't inhale. These thick, tender hunks of pork belly were lightly seasoned served on a bed of sauteed Chinese cabbage and snow peas. Nothing on the dish really worked in harmony, and it just seemed like a ingredients thrown together. BUT, don't let that stop you from checking on Just a Taste. If you read any of the descriptions above, you should already be on your way.
Just a Taste is one of Ithaca's most popular dining spots, and with good reason. It's incredibly affordable, and the food and wine are consistently good. Did I mention affordable?   The overall menu doesn't change too frequently, but that's okay because it's easy to know what to order. Don't miss the freshly made foccacia bread with roasted garlic and olive oil or the russet potato wedges with chipotle aioli. When the Brussels sprouts are in season, they're also well worth a try.  They're perfectly roasted and topped with freshly grated Parmesan.   The only downside is that they don't take reservations and it gets crazy busy, so arriving when it opens is a good tactic if you're dying to eat there.

In my opinion, this is the best restaurant in Ithaca. I've been twice, and it was great both times. The brussels sprouts are a pretty memorable dish for me. Really garlicy, salty, and mixed with pecan nuts. Damn good. Solid wine list as well. If only they accepted reservations, life would be a lot easier. However the place is rammed most nights, so it's understandable that they don't.
Man, I really wish we had this joint in the city! The tapas are SO moderately priced (when was the last time you paid $9 for a plate of 3 seared scallops?) and delicious, plus service was wonderful. We were seated at the bar and had a friendly bartender willing to answer our questions (bonus, she looked like she actually enjoyed her job) about the food and beer. Out of 6 plates that we ordered (scallops, spicy shrimp, cheese plate, eggplant focaccia, meatballs, and zucchini with browned butter), there were maybe only 2 that I could've done without. The seafood and meatballs were cooked well: not too dry, not undercooked either. The cheese plate only had 2 different types of cheese however, as opposed to the typical 3, but whatever, they were good. The eggplant focaccia and zucchini were ehhh...I just felt that they were too acidic for me, but not completely awful to the point where we didn't eat all of it. Next time I'm up in this area, this will definitely be a dinner spot!
Came here again tonight with the fam. Quality of the food wasn't as good and service was a bit rushed. Understandable though, since it was very crowded and the waiting line was only getting longer. Local Butternut Squash Sautéed in Brown Butter with Garlic, Pecans and Romano Cheese -Awesome! This dish is just addictive. In the wintertime, they substitute the local butternut squash with brussel sprouts, and that dish is my fave. Focaccia Bread was not as fresh today, but still good. Roasted Garlic was perfect. Spicy Shrimp Sauté with Tomato, Jalapeno, Onions, Lime and Cilantro, $6.25. -Shrimp was overcooked. Not impressed. Deep Fried Russet Potato Wedges with Chipotle Aioli: This never fails to satisfy! HUGE potato wedges with yummy chipotle aioli. I'll get this again and again. Tiramisu: Espresso-madeira soaked sponge cake with sabayon cream, chocolate shavings, and cocoa, $5 Surprisingly very good! Not a traditional recipe, but very good nonetheless, a perfect way to end a meal. I'd definitely get this again. The sponge cake had a pleasant nutty texture and was throughly soaked. Om nom! I was very pleased.
I was just visiting the campus and some friends, so I'm not a local. There was a long line and my friend recommended that we try it. I love tapas! It's a great way to try many dishes to get to know the chef and how (s)he utilizes local produce and ingredients. Overall the food was good, but presentation was somewhat lacking. It was very crowded, because it was the day students were coming back to school. I liked that they had wine samplers. I had the Reds flight - all were good, especially the one from France.
Pretty good food, and good service too. I came here late at night to grab a quick bite and drink with a friend, and the duck leg/mussels were surprisingly fresh. The duck leg wasn't marinated as well as it should have been, but it was tender and cooked well. Mussels were fresh, what more can I say? Seems like a good place for tapas, with some nice wines. A nice option for late night in Ithaca.
Every dish we had here was great.  I'm not sure you can go wrong with any item on the menu.  The wait staff was friendly and approachable and made sure we were satisfied before the kitchen closed for the night.  The dessert was just as good as the main courses. I will highly recommend this to all friends visiting Ithaca and make plans to be back next time I find myself in town!
Amazing, just amazing. Tapas and great wine, two of my favorite things. The menu rotates all the time, but there are some favorites that always stay on there, such as the foccacia, the duck plates, and there's usually some lamb (which I highly recommend). It's owned by the same guy who owns Madeline's and Zaza's. The wine list is great, but I was slightly disappointed with the Big Red Flight. They also serve ales like Lindeman's Framboise. Call ahead; they don't accept reservations and the wait is generally really long. Or just go have a beer at Korova around the corner.
Just A Taste is one of the places on my list that I eat at when I come back to Ithaca. The food is always simple concepts with excellent flavors. I love the wine flights-especially the local flight! And I like the hustle and bustle, crowded atmosphere. I feel like I am back in Europe, and enjoy making the effort to have my dining companions hear me above the bustling din. I have staples that I always order here: Fried Russet Potatoes with chipotle aoli. Amazing and spicy! Foccicia with a Whole Roasted Garlic Blub. Delicious dunked in some Oliver oil. And then I usually order a smatter of other items. On this particular visit my sister and I tried the Carmelized Brussel Sprouts-YUM! and  the Shrimp sauteed in Garlic and Sherry-probably wouldn't order that again; and the Brie and Apple Plate-very generous portions of brie! It's been a while since I have had dessert there-but if my memory serves me right, it shouldn't be passed up too often. I only wish Boulder, Colorado had a place like Just A Taste, I'd be a regular.
Having done a little Yelp research, I of course came up with a list of the top restaurants, not places, that I wanted to try with my boyfriend. On our last night, my boyfriend, who is an incoming graduate student, and I headed towards E. Seneca Street and North Aurora Street looking for the restaurant  after hiking the hills all day. What we saw when we got there was a cozy little shop filled to the brim and more with people. People sitting, people carrying trays quickly to serve, people tapping their feet inpatiently and waiting for a seat... just lots and lots of people. This was sort of surprising and a good sign, considering how small the city is. The wait ended up being nearly 45 minutes long and in good time too as we almost decided to go to another restaurant. We found ourselves seated fairly quickly by the windows and were instantly waited on by a friendly server. We ordered four dishes (which came in the order that I am listing them here)-- 1) the brie, apple, and crostini; 2) the sautéed chicken breast with potatoes and onion in a madeira sauce; 3) the steamed clams with andouille sausage and pickled onions in a tomato broth; and 4) the braised duck leg with prunes in a madeira-orange juice sauce. Out of the dishes, the brie, apple, and crostini stole the show. The combination of the smooth, creamy cheese with the crunchy bite of a sweet apple on a nicely toasted bread was very delightful. I was surprised by the amount of  cheese offered, as there was a huge melted chunk. I wish that they didn't skimp out so much on the bread and apple slices (but it's ok because my boyfriend can have a lot more cheese than I can). Either way we ate that plate clean and enjoyed it thoroughly. When the other dishes came out one by one and we tried every single one, we discovered that each had its own delightful flavors and texture. Though they were good, I wouldn't necessarily say it was the best thing I have ever eaten. Plus, the sangria was kind of too carbonated for my own taste and lack the punch and sweetness that I generally associate with it. Overall, it is a nice place to eat. If you asked me if I would wait another 45 minutes to go again, I most certainly wouldn't. I think this place is overhyped a bit, but nevertheless food is good and price is decent.
I really enjoyed my experience at Just A Taste! They have a wide variety of dishes that change regularly (or "on the reg" if you will).  The focaccia was a great choice and came with a whole clove of garlic and a bowl to make a dipping sauce using the olive oil on the table. The New Potatoes were well flavored and one of my favorite dishes we ordered.  My favorite dish however was the spinach salad with feta cheese, black cherries and lemon dressing was out of this world! I was skeptical of ordering a salad initially, but wow (!!) it was so good.  We ordered two of the chicken dishes.  One was a sliced chicken breast with potatoes, onions and madiera which I preferred and the other was a chicken and rice dish with a tomato based sauce which my friend preferred. Just A Taste was certainly one of (if not the) best tapas restaurant I have been to and I'd certainly recommend it to anyone in the Ithaca area.  I only took away one star because of the price.  This is a problem with all Tapas places because the system is set up to give you small amounts of food for relatively high prices.  Just A Taste is no different in this way, but definitely worth it!
My 3 roommates and I came here for a belated birthday dinner. Unfortunately there weren't any tables outside so we had to sit inside, but the decor inside is super cute and artsy. We shared 4 tapas and I got the local wine flight. I can't remember exactly what we got but it included a bread dish, shrimp, and spicy chicken wings. Everything was absolutely delicious and we loved the fact that we could try and share all the dishes without spending too much money. We were all left reasonably full even though the four of us only got four tapas plates. Parking is available in the public garage the next block over. I think it's free after 6pm and on weekends (something like that). The service was also nice and friendly. I'd definitely come back here to try their other plates and wine flights. Great for going with a group of friends or a date night!
Everything was delicious, but here are my recommendations: Brie with melon crustini, deep fried potato, cabbage, coconut empanadas with cilantro, lime yogurt sauce and entree Orange marinated chicken thigh sautéed with onions and carrots with orange marmalade, cucumber, walnuts and rice.
This tapas bar is very delicious.  I came here while visiting my brother at Cornell.  We had the spaghetti, which was light and went well accompanying the other foods.  The white mushrooms were also very good.  We had two orders of the foccacia bread with roasted garlic and the bread was very soft and thick.  We also had the clams which were delicious.  We ordered the zucchini which was not bad, considering I'm not a zucchini lover.   The portions are small, of course.  It wasn't too pricey because we came with four people and the bill was $56 sans wine. The chocolate souffle was superb!  It was petite but it was fluffy with whipped cream on top. It wasn't too sweet.   Out of all the restaurants in Ithaca, I definitely recommend visiting this one.  I was disappointed I ate here first because the other restaurants paled in comparison. We got here at 5:20, 10 minutes before opening so we didn't have to wait long.  However, I did overhear the waitress tell others that the wait would be a little over an hour at around 6:00.  The service is not the friendliest but it's expected from such a busy eatery.
A MUST: Order The Brussel Sprouts (I hate brussel sprouts, but this is amazing! My favorite thing on the menu). Just a Taste is a great place. You'll always find Cornell professors eating there (a sign that it is good). It is a very small place with a very long line so expect to wait or get there early. I have eaten here a few times with my family and we have enjoyed eating here every time. My parents tell everyone about this place when they're back home. Great home cooking (the portions are relatively small, and it may add up, but it's worth the price).
I have heard so many great reviews about this restaurant, and maybe because of this high expectation, I didn't feel that this restaurant had much special or especially great in any aspect. It was a raining day, so we couldn't sit outside and it felt crowded inside. The service was nice but I don't think she gave us much helpful recommendation on ordering. We didn't like the tapas that much and the portion was sort of small, which made it feel pricy.
Definitely one of the best restaurants in Ithaca, if not the best. Incredible quality and taste, I came here regularly for four years and always tried different things and have never been disappointed. We always expected the bill to be astronomical by the end but it was somehow always super affordable. You can't go wrong here!
There are many things I miss about living in Ithaca, but Just a Taste is one of the things I miss the most. It is definitely my favorite restaurant in town. I never had a disappointing meal there. Be sure to order the Focaccia. The rest of the menu is usually changing, but like I said, I never had something I didn't enjoy. And since Ithaca is a veggie friendly town, there are lots of vegetarian options.   Although it was a little bit of a splurge on my graduate student budget at the time, I made a point to go as often as I could. If you are in Ithaca be sure to check it out.
The wait-staff are great concerning gluten-free issues. I have celiac's disease and they are quick to tell me what I can and can't eat on the menu. I have eaten here for years and have never had a problem. This is my favorite place to eat in Ithaca.
Lovely place that has both interesting and creative tapas. My friend and I went on a Thursday night, and I found a small wire in my lamb dish (probably leftover from prep). They could have simply brought us a new plate or discounted our meal, but they went above and beyond: entirely new dish of our choosing (as well as taking the lamb dish off of our check). I am a server and felt extremely well taken care of at this establishment. Excellent food and service!
Best restaurant in Ithaca. Worth it just for the sangria.

By far my favorite restaurant in downtown Ithaca, Just a Taste serves up delicious food and has great service. What a fun way to eat! I often come here with my partner and we slowly order tapas until we're full. Some of our favorites are the clams in white wine and lemon, the garlic braised greens with walnuts, blue cheese and sherry vinegar, and their warm chocolate souffle with chocolate ganache. Other memorable tapas have included such yummy treats as a chanterelle and black trumpet mushroom bread pudding, arancinis with ricotta salata and sauteed sole in a sorrel cream sauce. During the warmer months, I adore dining on Just a Taste's back patio by candlelight under two gorgeous birch trees. I always feel like I am on vacation! What else can I tell you? This place is extremely reasonably priced, has some great flights of wine and some fabulous desserts!

We stopped in while visiting family this summer, after all these years Just A Taste is still one of the best in Ithaca. We had five dishes and 4 glasses of wine; all the food was creative and interesting while remaining true to the ingredients, perfectly executed and damn tasty. The wines are well chosen and represent a great selection from all over the world. Just A Taste will always be a stop on our Ithaca visits.
Everything was delicious, but here are my recommendations: Brie with melon crustini, deep fried potato, cabbage, coconut empanadas with cilantro, lime yogurt sauce and entree Orange marinated chicken thigh sautéed with onions and carrots with orange marmalade, cucumber, walnuts and rice.
Expect long waits, but it is worth it. Their tapas are really great, especially their clams.

Loved their tapas. Everything is so impressive. But the service could be better.

This is a great place to go for a special occasion. The tapas are fantastic. We went with friends and everyone picked a couple dishes and we all shared the tapas and a bottle of wine. WOW. The sweet potato pakoras were a crowd favorite. I've always been a huge fan of the greens. Make sure you go early because you will wait a long time otherwise. This place is always packed after 6pm

I'm glad we saved this place for our last meal in the Finger Lakes.  The reviews did not disappoint. JAT does not take reservations, so your best bet is to try to get here for 5:30 when they open the doors.  We got there at about 5:15 and were lucky enough to score some of the last chairs at the bar.  Your next best bet is to come back about an hour later when all of the first seating people are done. My husband ordered a sangria, which was a little syrupy and sweet for him, and I had a mug of cider.   Between the two of us, We ordered: -Russet potatoes with chipotle aioli (2) -Mushrooms -Brussel sprouts -Homemade Andouille sausage with polenta -Pork loin with mashed potatoes and Concord grape sauce -Tiramisu (to go) The potatoes with aioli were so good we ended up ordering them twice.  They were the closest thing we've had to the patatas bravas we ate in Spain in a long time. I could eat these every day. The mushrooms were very good and you get a decent sized portion.  My husband enjoyed these more than I did.  I didn't see many portobello mushroom pieces in the dish, but that could have been because my husband ate them all.   The brussel sprouts with pecans were amazing!  Get them...you won't regret it.  They were cooked and seasoned to perfection. The homemade sausage was awesome.  Just the right amount of spice and a decent sized portion to share between 2 people.  Double your order if you have more people because you'll be fighting over who gets more than a forkful.  I loved the polenta cake and the slaw too. The pork loin was our last dish and I regret getting it.  The loin was dry and tough and the mashed potatoes lacked seasoning and were luke warm.  Not my favorite dish of the night. We ordered the tiramisu to go and they even thought to include forks, spoons and napkins.  It was delicious and a huge portion.  Well worth the price. The bartender worked her butt off all night and made sure our drinks were refilled and we were well attended too.  Overall, it was a great meal and I look forward to going back.  I wish I could give it a 4.5, but the pork and the sangria brought my rating down to a 4.
Definitely one of the best restaurants in Ithaca, if not the best. Incredible quality and taste, I came here regularly for four years and always tried different things and have never been disappointed. We always expected the bill to be astronomical by the end but it was somehow always super affordable. You can't go wrong here!
Still perf for dates

Quite good.  A bit small inside so we sat on top of people and our table was the wrong size for a party of 5 + tapas + drinks.  That is my only knock...good beer selection and food of high quality.  Well-varied menu that doesn't get too pretentious.  I'd stack JAT against any other tapas joint....especially at the affordable price point.
I can't say it better than Monica S. She pretty much summarized my thoughts on this restaurant.
The wait-staff are great concerning gluten-free issues. I have celiac's disease and they are quick to tell me what I can and can't eat on the menu. I have eaten here for years and have never had a problem. This is my favorite place to eat in Ithaca.
The food is very good, though it could be better if they reduced the size of the menu. I liked everything I tried. The service was very poor, however. After waiting over five minutes, we finally had to flag down and ask a waitress to take our drink order. They are inattentive and slow, which is unfortunate because of the good food.
Lovely place that has both interesting and creative tapas. My friend and I went on a Thursday night, and I found a small wire in my lamb dish (probably leftover from prep).

I am a server and felt extremely well taken care of at this establishment. Excellent food and service!
The hype about this place didn't ring true. The food was good but not fantastic, and the service was mediocre. The best we tried were the rosemary potatoes, buffalo meatballs and spicy shrimp. The outdoor patio was very nice. If you think this is great tapas, I suggest you try Amada in Philadelphia.
Best restaurant in Ithaca. Worth it just for the sangria.

Overall pretty good, only good for small groups because the restaurant is on the smaller side.  Service was decent, food came out fast and it was very good
We stopped in while visiting family this summer, after all these years Just A Taste is still one of the best in Ithaca. We had five dishes and 4 glasses of wine; all the food was creative and interesting while remaining true to the ingredients, perfectly executed and damn tasty. The wines are well chosen and represent a great selection from all over the world. Just A Taste will always be a stop on our Ithaca visits.
Overall, I love Just a Taste and would recommend it to anyone.  Some of my favorites are the sauteed mushrooms, cod fritters, melon/apple with brie, and the flat bread.  The rotating/seasonal items are always awesome too!  There is always a long wait (pretty much any night) because the food is consistently good.  Outdoor seating is very pleasant in the summer and fall. The only issue I have with this place (after 5 years of living in Ithaca and coming here a lot) is the frequently bad service.  For such an incredibly small restaurant (unless you are outside, the bartender can even see everyone in the room) you have to wait ages for service, they don't check up on you/refill drinks/get additional orders, and the waiters are almost rude.  I've been here in various groups (with parents, friends, couples, etc) and I have pretty much always had this experience, save one or two visits.   I would still recommend it for the food - which is amazing - but the service almost makes it not worth it.
Expect long waits, but it is worth it. Their tapas are really great, especially their clams.
I am writing my first Yelp review about Just a Taste because this restaurant generally gets me all riled up one way or the other.  On one hand, the food really is awesome - it's very creative but sane, the menu changes constantly, and eating there really is a blast.  All that being said, I just don't get the service.  I have lived here for ten years and it seems as though they have maintained a lot of their staff.  Maybe it's time for some people to move on.  Don't even think about going within half an hour of their closing.  You will get menus thrown at you and you will be rushed through your entire meal.  Also don't get on the wait list if they're within 45 minutes of closing.  I say this because I once got on the list and was told "about 20 minutes" - I then waited for 45, and then was told "sorry, no table has opened up yet and now we're about the close."  This was so unacceptable I can't believe that I ever returned. Another memorable moment was on a gorgeous day in early spring - I called around 2pm to see if their patio would be open that evening.  I got a woman on the phone - and she answered "well would YOU like to come in and work on a beautiful day like this?"  I didn't even understand the question.  I said "excuse me?" and she then said "if I can't call in  staff that want to come in to work the patio tonight then I can't open the patio."  Well, ok.  I think "no I'm sorry" would have been a more obvious answer to give to a customer, because her statement was rude and made it seem like she didn't know how to run her business (there's this thing called the weather forecast - might be helpful on some occassions). Anyway, obviously, this place bugs the piss out of me sometimes.  Other times, I have sooo much fun there and the food and the wine is so spot on, that they're instantly forgiven.  I can't even help but give them 4 stars because some of the best meals I have had in Ithaca have been at Just a Taste.  I think parties of 5 or 6 are perfect for this place - especially nice for a celebration or out of town guests. One more thing that bugs me!  Do brunch or don't do brunch.  It drives me craaaaazzzzy. As far as price goes, hey, you get what you pay for.  If your date's a vegetarian you won't pay much.  If you want to buy every fish item on the menu, yeah, it'll add up fast.  Always get the foccacia and ask for it midway through your meal, so you can use it to soak up the leftover sauces from various dishes.  Wine is very reasonably priced.
Loved their tapas. Everything is so impressive. But the service could be better.
potato wedges w. chipotle sauce. Yum yum yum.
This is a great place to go for a special occasion. The tapas are fantastic. We went with friends and everyone picked a couple dishes and we all shared the tapas and a bottle of wine. WOW.

This is one of those places that I'm glad I waited to try more than once before I wrote a review about it. My first visit was wonderful. I decided that it was a good place for a quiet date, with tasty food and relatively good service. In fact, the food is above and beyond when it comes to Ithaca. In general, the Focaccia (tasty, homemade, flavorful), pork loin (good texture, well seasoned, not overcooked or tough), spicy shrimp sautee (one of my favorites: love the cilantro, but it could use more spiciness), lamb chop (savory and tender), warm brie crostini (rich, creamy, with a good balance of fruit and cheese), salads (pretty fresh, nicely sized servings), and chocolate souffle (deliciously warm, devilishly sweet) are winners. The textures, flavors, and variety make these dishes more memorable than others. I also especially like the drink options (I suggest trying the Local Wine Flight) and the changing menu. And, I guess I still hold that this place isn't too bad for a date spot and that the food quality is what would make me come back. But in hindsight, I realize the service was only slightly-above-decent (not even spectacular) because the place was empty on a Thursday, early in the evening. Let me tell you about my subsequent experiences... The most memorable was just this past weekend. We went with a group of eight. It took us forever to get seated (a group of us had to wait about forty-five minutes to get the table). Then, when three people were running a little late, Just a Taste basically gave our table away. We got stuck at a small table in the back, outside, under a tree that birthed nasty little strings of pollen into our food and drinks. And then, when our friends arrived, mere moments later, they waited around the front while the hostess ignored them. (Given, the place was crowded, but they had politely intoned that their group was already seated). Once we were all joined in the back, our friends stood around for another thirty minutes or so waiting for more chairs or a table. One waitress came up, and with unnecessary attitude, told them to move out of the way. "If you're going to wait around here, move to the side." There was no please or thank you involved. After standing for some time, the waitress realized that maybe handing out some menus would be helpful in speeding along the ordering process once we all sat down. She basically tossed a stack of menus at us. And there about ten too many. Um. Okay. I know you're busy, but you can still act courteous and make your customers feel individual, welcome, and respected. Once we were all finally seated and we pulled the tables together, the waitress started taking orders. This dish and that dish were missing. Ok, no problem. I understand, it was a full night and you have limited supplies. But then, when my friend's shrimp dish came out and 3/10 shrimp were missing (he ordered the Racion instead of the smaller Tapa), he had to ASK about it before the waitress said in a matter of fact voice "well, we ran out of shrimp so you just get the seven." Wait, really? First, we had to ask about it. Second, there was no apology. Third, why are YOU giving US attitude for making an inquiry about food we're paying for? Look, I'm not a difficult customer. I am forgiving and understanding when you are busy, but all I ask for is some kind, and relatively friendly service. To be fair, another waitress (with short brown hair) was much more pleasant. She came out later to apologize and to inform my friend that the shrimp were out but that she would charge him less for the dish. (Actually, I think she should have charged for the Tapa instead of a few bucks less than the Racion, even if it would mean giving my friend TWO extra shrimp)...In general, she was funny and helpful, and I liked her spunky personality. But the other ones kind of just dropped dishes off, literally, and didn't really try to set the right dishes in front of the right customers. Sloppy and inconsiderate. I paid for me and a friend, and I ended up dropping $60 and I wasn't even full. The whole fiasco took way too long and the experience was very disappointing. Oh, and the best part? It started to rain, and the only recognition we got for sitting out there was "I'll try to write up your check soon so that you don't have to sit in the rain too long." Is there no cover? Also, no heating lamps or something to make the seating outside more tolerable? I can deal with chunks of pollen in my mashed potatoes, missy, and the wind blowing my parmesan off my salad, but I don't think I want to be cold and wet on top of that. Thanks. Otherwise, Just a Taste is really busy (probably because of the novelty of Tapas in Ithaca, and because of the lack of affordable date spots otherwise) so I suggest you go early to beat the rush. And don't expect anything but barely-mediocre service. When you get the rare nice server, count yourself lucky. Drinks, great. Food, good. Service, pretty bad. Seating, cramped.
I'm glad we saved this place for our last meal in the Finger Lakes.  The reviews did not disappoint. JAT does not take reservations, so your best bet is to try to get here for 5:30 when they open the doors.  We got there at about 5:15 and were lucky enough to score some of the last chairs at the bar.  Your next best bet is to come back about an hour later when all of the first seating people are done. My husband ordered a sangria, which was a little syrupy and sweet for him, and I had a mug of cider.   Between the two of us, We ordered: -Russet potatoes with chipotle aioli (2) -Mushrooms -Brussel sprouts -Homemade Andouille sausage with polenta -Pork loin with mashed potatoes and Concord grape sauce -Tiramisu (to go) The potatoes with aioli were so good we ended up ordering them twice.  They were the closest thing we've had to the patatas bravas we ate in Spain in a long time. I could eat these every day. The mushrooms were very good and you get a decent sized portion.  My husband enjoyed these more than I did.  I didn't see many portobello mushroom pieces in the dish, but that could have been because my husband ate them all.   The brussel sprouts with pecans were amazing!  Get them...you won't regret it.  They were cooked and seasoned to perfection. The homemade sausage was awesome.  Just the right amount of spice and a decent sized portion to share between 2 people.  Double your order if you have more people because you'll be fighting over who gets more than a forkful.  I loved the polenta cake and the slaw too. The pork loin was our last dish and I regret getting it.  The loin was dry and tough and the mashed potatoes lacked seasoning and were luke warm.  Not my favorite dish of the night. We ordered the tiramisu to go and they even thought to include forks, spoons and napkins.  It was delicious and a huge portion.  Well worth the price. The bartender worked her butt off all night and made sure our drinks were refilled and we were well attended too.  Overall, it was a great meal and I look forward to going back.  I wish I could give it a 4.5, but the pork and the sangria brought my rating down to a 4.
I lived in Ithaca for four years, and now that I've moved away I can't stop thinking about Just a Taste. It is one of my favorite restaurants ever, period; I found many good excuses to go, from dates and anniversaries to parental visits and graduation. The wine selection alone is reason enough to go -- give the local Finger Lakes flight a try -- and the food is just unfreakingbelievable. Everything I've ever tried there has been consistently fresh, well-thought-out, and delicious without being fussy. Be sure to try the homemade foccacia, potato wedges with chipotle aioli, tortilla espanola, and the ever-changing selection of dessert ices and granitas.
Still perf for dates
This is a very good restaurant.  It's been a while since I was there, though, so I can't remember specific dishes to recommend.  It's definitely a highlight to be able to order flights of wine.
Quite good.  A bit small inside so we sat on top of people and our table was the wrong size for a party of 5 + tapas + drinks.  That is my only knock...good beer selection and food of high quality.  Well-varied menu that doesn't get too pretentious.  I'd stack JAT against any other tapas joint....especially at the affordable price point.
Good food and good service. A little expensive but a fun experience. Try the wine flights, they are the best deal for drinks and a cool way to try a bunch of different tastes. Not a place to go if you are really hungry but a great place for a smaller meal and some wine. Perfect date place. Seating can be hard to come by, especially on the weekends.
I can't say it better than Monica S. She pretty much summarized my thoughts on this restaurant.
I went with a big group of about 10 people and though we doubled up on all the orders, I left this place still feling hungry.  Definitely ask the waitstaff how much is a good amount to order for your particular group size.  Everyone HAS to get the foccaccia bread, it is simply divine!
The food is very good, though it could be better if they reduced the size of the menu. I liked everything I tried. The service was very poor, however. After waiting over five minutes, we finally had to flag down and ask a waitress to take our drink order. They are inattentive and slow, which is unfortunate because of the good food.
I wish yelp had extra stars for this.  Just a Taste is my favorite restaurant in the whole world ever.  Ever.  I go back to Ithaca just to eat here.  My mom - also a foodie to the extreme - rates the chocolate souffle one of the best she's ever had.  Words cannot describe how much I love this place.  Back patio is so charming.  Foccacia with roasted garlic is a must (to be used to dip in every dish you order), as is pretty much everything on the menu.  Boyfriend and I went this summer and, for some crazy reason, weren't in the mood for wine.  We ordered and ate until we were overstuffed and even took some stuff home and paid under $40.  I was in disbelief (probably because I've always ordered wine) but it's true - the best restaurant on the planet is priced well within reason!
The hype about this place didn't ring true. The food was good but not fantastic, and the service was mediocre. The best we tried were the rosemary potatoes, buffalo meatballs and spicy shrimp. The outdoor patio was very nice. If you think this is great tapas, I suggest you try Amada in Philadelphia.
I've been here many times and am always so happy after I leave. I don't care about the wait, the food is worth it. We always go an hour earlier than we plan to eat, get on the list and then go get a drink. Works perfectly.
Overall pretty good, only good for small groups because the restaurant is on the smaller side.  Service was decent, food came out fast and it was very good
I and a ole' girl pal of mine are both vegetarians so I can only speak on behalf of her and my dishes which we shared after we sampled bits of each others appetizers of course, we both got 1 appetizer each and the portion for the appetizer was surprisingly generous so, because I have a huge sweet tooth naturally assumed the desserts would be as large as the appetizers had been. We each got different vegetarian dishes for dinner as well as different wine 'flights' which by the way were all quite reasonably priced. The variety of wine I tasted was very good, crisp and not too watery, bitter or sweet.... jjust riight :O) As for our dinners, both our orders--my friends eggplant parm and salad and my pasta were dually very well put together and came out of the kitchen in a impressive assembly looking very much like a Parisian plate is put together. My friend said that her food was on a scale of 1-5 a 3 and I affirm similar views to my friend, I'd give my dinner 3.5 out of 5. Now, I was really disappointed after the meal when my friend and I decided to order 1 dessert and share it between us, we chose the fudge squares--now, please understand that my friend who was dining with me that night does not have nearly as big a 'sweet tooth' as I do so I deem that her rating of the dessert would be what the average person would think of the fudge plate that came to us. She said it was very good, the dessert that is and considered it a 4.3 out of 5 while I on the other hand was appalled by the obscenely small portion quantity on the little plate that arrived at our table. When I say that the dessert portion was small I mean minuscule. In sum; Just a Taste offers  great wine, a good amount of vegetarian (note: not vegan) dishes  and if your evening commences as mine did and you choose to 'share' a dessert with whomever you go there with expect to receive only literally 'just a taste'.
Overall, I love Just a Taste and would recommend it to anyone.  Some of my favorites are the sauteed mushrooms, cod fritters, melon/apple with brie, and the flat bread.  The rotating/seasonal items are always awesome too!  There is always a long wait (pretty much any night) because the food is consistently good.  Outdoor seating is very pleasant in the summer and fall. The only issue I have with this place (after 5 years of living in Ithaca and coming here a lot) is the frequently bad service.  For such an incredibly small restaurant (unless you are outside, the bartender can even see everyone in the room) you have to wait ages for service, they don't check up on you/refill drinks/get additional orders, and the waiters are almost rude.  I've been here in various groups (with parents, friends, couples, etc) and I have pretty much always had this experience, save one or two visits.   I would still recommend it for the food - which is amazing - but the service almost makes it not worth it.
A bit too long of a wait but it was totally worth it. I had the most delicious mushroom tapas. It really was as good as the tapas I've had in Spain. Excellent restaurant.
I am writing my first Yelp review about Just a Taste because this restaurant generally gets me all riled up one way or the other.  On one hand, the food really is awesome - it's very creative but sane, the menu changes constantly, and eating there really is a blast.  All that being said, I just don't get the service.  I have lived here for ten years and it seems as though they have maintained a lot of their staff.  Maybe it's time for some people to move on.  Don't even think about going within half an hour of their closing.  You will get menus thrown at you and you will be rushed through your entire meal.  Also don't get on the wait list if they're within 45 minutes of closing.  I say this because I once got on the list and was told "about 20 minutes" - I then waited for 45, and then was told "sorry, no table has opened up yet and now we're about the close."  This was so unacceptable I can't believe that I ever returned. Another memorable moment was on a gorgeous day in early spring - I called around 2pm to see if their patio would be open that evening.  I got a woman on the phone - and she answered "well would YOU like to come in and work on a beautiful day like this?"  I didn't even understand the question.  I said "excuse me?" and she then said "if I can't call in  staff that want to come in to work the patio tonight then I can't open the patio."  Well, ok.  I think "no I'm sorry" would have been a more obvious answer to give to a customer, because her statement was rude and made it seem like she didn't know how to run her business (there's this thing called the weather forecast - might be helpful on some occassions). Anyway, obviously, this place bugs the piss out of me sometimes.  Other times, I have sooo much fun there and the food and the wine is so spot on, that they're instantly forgiven.  I can't even help but give them 4 stars because some of the best meals I have had in Ithaca have been at Just a Taste.  I think parties of 5 or 6 are perfect for this place - especially nice for a celebration or out of town guests. One more thing that bugs me!  Do brunch or don't do brunch.  It drives me craaaaazzzzy. As far as price goes, hey, you get what you pay for.  If your date's a vegetarian you won't pay much.  If you want to buy every fish item on the menu, yeah, it'll add up fast.  Always get the foccacia and ask for it midway through your meal, so you can use it to soak up the leftover sauces from various dishes.  Wine is very reasonably priced.
two stars docked off for the long wait and service.  they don't take any reservations except for graduation weekend which is slightly annoying since i wanted to put my name down as i was already driving towards the restaurant.  the wait time was also longer than the approximate they gave me by 10-20 minutes.  the staff isn't entirely friendly, very standard service-- they just bring you the menu and food and leave-- no extra smile, no desire to help us with the wine menu or decide/explain dishes. the food was pretty good. the fococcia was a little hard and the charcuterie was just okay (and i usually lovelovelove pates and rillettes, etc. of the three, i only really liked the liver).  the clams were delicious! and i wanted to just drink up the sauce.  and the duck leg with couscous was amazing as well.  i had the italian flight which was good but not amazing in my opinion.  the coconut bread pudding and chocolate souffle were excellent!  both desserts were warm and melted in mouth.  the chocolate was very rich and the bread pudding not overly sweet.  amazing textures for both. overall it was a mediocre dining experience.  if it hadn't been for the good company and the extra oomph the alcohol from the tasting flight gave me, i don't think i'd want to bear the long wait to come again... unless it's for dessert around closing time (the restaurant clears out pretty quickly)
potato wedges w. chipotle sauce. Yum yum yum.
Every time I've gone to Ithaca, this is on my list of dinner spots.  There is frequently a wait here for a table, as they do not take reservations, but it's well worth waiting for.  They have a wonderful wine menu of both local and international varieties.  Lots of them are available by the glass, which is awesome.  They do "flights" of wines, which I recommend.  The food is all tapas style, though they do offer several entree or large portion items.  Somehow we always end up ordering many of the same items, and multiple potato dishes, haha.  They have a Spanish style tortilla that I cannot ever resist...
This is one of those places that I'm glad I waited to try more than once before I wrote a review about it. My first visit was wonderful. I decided that it was a good place for a quiet date, with tasty food and relatively good service. In fact, the food is above and beyond when it comes to Ithaca. In general, the Focaccia (tasty, homemade, flavorful), pork loin (good texture, well seasoned, not overcooked or tough), spicy shrimp sautee (one of my favorites: love the cilantro, but it could use more spiciness), lamb chop (savory and tender), warm brie crostini (rich, creamy, with a good balance of fruit and cheese), salads (pretty fresh, nicely sized servings), and chocolate souffle (deliciously warm, devilishly sweet) are winners. The textures, flavors, and variety make these dishes more memorable than others. I also especially like the drink options (I suggest trying the Local Wine Flight) and the changing menu. And, I guess I still hold that this place isn't too bad for a date spot and that the food quality is what would make me come back. But in hindsight, I realize the service was only slightly-above-decent (not even spectacular) because the place was empty on a Thursday, early in the evening. Let me tell you about my subsequent experiences... The most memorable was just this past weekend. We went with a group of eight. It took us forever to get seated (a group of us had to wait about forty-five minutes to get the table). Then, when three people were running a little late, Just a Taste basically gave our table away. We got stuck at a small table in the back, outside, under a tree that birthed nasty little strings of pollen into our food and drinks. And then, when our friends arrived, mere moments later, they waited around the front while the hostess ignored them. (Given, the place was crowded, but they had politely intoned that their group was already seated). Once we were all joined in the back, our friends stood around for another thirty minutes or so waiting for more chairs or a table. One waitress came up, and with unnecessary attitude, told them to move out of the way. "If you're going to wait around here, move to the side." There was no please or thank you involved. After standing for some time, the waitress realized that maybe handing out some menus would be helpful in speeding along the ordering process once we all sat down. She basically tossed a stack of menus at us. And there about ten too many. Um. Okay. I know you're busy, but you can still act courteous and make your customers feel individual, welcome, and respected. Once we were all finally seated and we pulled the tables together, the waitress started taking orders. This dish and that dish were missing. Ok, no problem. I understand, it was a full night and you have limited supplies. But then, when my friend's shrimp dish came out and 3/10 shrimp were missing (he ordered the Racion instead of the smaller Tapa), he had to ASK about it before the waitress said in a matter of fact voice "well, we ran out of shrimp so you just get the seven." Wait, really? First, we had to ask about it. Second, there was no apology. Third, why are YOU giving US attitude for making an inquiry about food we're paying for? Look, I'm not a difficult customer. I am forgiving and understanding when you are busy, but all I ask for is some kind, and relatively friendly service. To be fair, another waitress (with short brown hair) was much more pleasant. She came out later to apologize and to inform my friend that the shrimp were out but that she would charge him less for the dish. (Actually, I think she should have charged for the Tapa instead of a few bucks less than the Racion, even if it would mean giving my friend TWO extra shrimp)...In general, she was funny and helpful, and I liked her spunky personality. But the other ones kind of just dropped dishes off, literally, and didn't really try to set the right dishes in front of the right customers. Sloppy and inconsiderate. I paid for me and a friend, and I ended up dropping $60 and I wasn't even full. The whole fiasco took way too long and the experience was very disappointing. Oh, and the best part? It started to rain, and the only recognition we got for sitting out there was "I'll try to write up your check soon so that you don't have to sit in the rain too long." Is there no cover? Also, no heating lamps or something to make the seating outside more tolerable? I can deal with chunks of pollen in my mashed potatoes, missy, and the wind blowing my parmesan off my salad, but I don't think I want to be cold and wet on top of that. Thanks. Otherwise, Just a Taste is really busy (probably because of the novelty of Tapas in Ithaca, and because of the lack of affordable date spots otherwise) so I suggest you go early to beat the rush. And don't expect anything but barely-mediocre service. When you get the rare nice server, count yourself lucky. Drinks, great. Food, good. Service, pretty bad. Seating, cramped.
Not a bad place, good food and good service. I liked it

THE best tapas place I have been to, that is also within my price range.  They have very simple dishes that are very well done.  Two years after leaving Ithaca, I still remember the warm brie with melon, sauteed portabella mushrooms,  and the best titamisu I have had.  I can't wait to go back and revisit the restaurant.
This is a very good restaurant.  It's been a while since I was there, though, so I can't remember specific dishes to recommend.  It's definitely a highlight to be able to order flights of wine.
Ordered the "local flight" to pair locally produced wine with my dishes: 5 sample wine glasses for only $12!! That price is an unbelievable way to enhance your small plates while appreciating the Finger Lakes wine country. By myself, I ordered the braised duck, salmon, and flat bread dishes - all were bursting with unique, contrasting flavors. The total bill was around $40 (with the wine pairings included), which is amazing for Tapas IMO. I would return to try the other dishes on the menu. I'm taking off a Star for its small size and non-memorable decor/atmosphere (compared to other fancy Tapas restaurants I've been to).

Just a Taste, like many restaurants in Ithaca, just doesn't try hard enough. I recently gave this so-called Spanish tapas restaurant another try after being underwhelmed over a year ago. An underlying theme for the dishes here would be a lack of seasoning paired with aioli to dip it in. You forget that the main component doesn't have much flavor because the rich garlic dipping sauce is all you taste. Items sampled this time: Braised Lamb with couscous: One of the highlights of the meal. Braised Chicken with fried polenta: The chicken part was actually good, but didn't look very appetizing. The fried polenta wedge tasted like oil, because the polenta was completely unseasoned. Pork loin with mashed potatoes: Dry slice of pre-roasted pork loin with a pile of decent mashed potatoes on top. Tortilla espanola: Not tortilla espanola. What you get here is basically a frittata: pockets of spongy baked egg with huge chunks of potato in it, and the omnipresent aioli. This is supposed to be thinly sliced potatoes essentially poached in olive oil, which then soak up the eggs added to them before baking. Salt cod fritters: One of the better items, but it's pretty hard to discern the cod from the filler. Also, more aioli. Sauteed mushrooms: Mushrooms, sauteed. If there was anything else in there, I couldn't taste it. Seared Mahi Mahi with roasted beets: The fish was dry but tasty. The beets were nicely flavored. But this too had aioli with it... Chocolate Souffle: Not a souffle. This is actually just a warm pseudo-molten chocolate cake. You can't make a souffle in advance and microwave it later. Ours came out so fast there's no way they could have been made any other way. Sure it's good, but don't call it a souffle. I do recommend the wines here. The very reasonably priced flights are a nice touch.
One of the best restaurants in Ithaca, and definitely the best downtown. Their menu is excellent & constantly changing, their wine selection is vast, with a variety of flights to suit every taste, and their ingredients are fresh, local, and expertly prepared. Best of all, their prices are eminently reasonable-- the first time my wife and I ate there, we sent the bill back because we were sure they must have left something off. One word of warning-- they fill up *very* quickly, especially on weekends, and they don't take reservations. However, the excellent food is well worth it.
Pros: 1.) Conveniently located 2.) Parking nearby 3.) (Very?) Good food, tapas-style 4.) Well-priced Cons: 1.) Small and difficult to navigate 2.) Loud (many people talking in a small space) 3.) Almost always busy (can be a very long wait) 4.) Decor OK 5.) OBNOXIOUS wait staff. I used to think my experience was anomalous, until at a bar the other night I overheard other people discussing this. Recommendation: Go! I would rate this higher if it weren't for the staff. The food is good, the price just fine, and the experience worthwhile. However, don't expect to be charmed by the all-too secure wait staff...
This is a tapas bar, and it is high scale. Very quiet and romantic and expensive. They have rare kinds of fish and drinks. The only downside is that its always booked. You would have to stand in the door way for one to two hours and wait for a table or make reservations a week ahead. It is very good for groups of people because you can each share your meals.
Delicious and frequently updated tapas menu and nice wine flights. Don't expect much else, but there is a lot to be said for doing one thing and doing it really well.
Should be michelin star rated.  Better than any place I've eaten at in California.
What is there not to love about this place? Tapas (small Spanish dishes) that you can share with a group for friends in a decorative back porch that is perfect for a date or just to enjoy on a fine summer day! Almost every main dish and dessert taste very delicious. And don't be afraid to order lots to have your fill. So come down to downtown; you won't be disappointed! Check out their website for hours and sample menu!

The very reasonably priced flights are a nice touch.
I would love to give Just a Taste the full five stars, but I just can't, considering that they don't take reservations and the wait can be excruciatingly long--especially when you've got a growling stomach (unless you enjoy early bird dining at 5:30pm or being fashionably late at 9:30pm...which I usually don't). Otherwise, it is a fantastic dining experience. Just a Taste's wine selection is amazing. I highly recommend trying one of the many flights that they offer, because really, why have one kind of wine when you can have five? 'Nuff said. Certain items on the menu are staples, and others rotate in and out depending on the season. I honestly don't think you can go wrong, but if you are unsure, the servers are more than happy to help you narrow things down and give their opinions on what's a must-try. Start off with the housemade focaccia--it sounds simple, but I promise, you won't be disappointed. My absolute favorite, drool-worthy dish is the Brussels sprouts sauteed in brown butter with garlic, pecans, and romano (Just a Taste is single-handedly responsible for my rediscovery of Brussels sprouts and just how DIVINE they can be when cooked well...no offense, Mom). The saffron risotto with manchego cheese and herbs is lovely, as are the housemade creole sausage with kale and shrimp, and the grilled pork loin with soft polenta and fennel-pear salad. We are typically too full to go for dessert, but it has always looked incredible on other people's tables. And now I am drooling on my computer. YUM.
One of the best restaurants in Ithaca, and definitely the best downtown. Their menu is excellent & constantly changing, their wine selection is vast, with a variety of flights to suit every taste, and their ingredients are fresh, local, and expertly prepared. Best of all, their prices are eminently reasonable-- the first time my wife and I ate there, we sent the bill back because we were sure they must have left something off. One word of warning-- they fill up *very* quickly, especially on weekends, and they don't take reservations. However, the excellent food is well worth it.
Had new years eve dinner there and was treated superbly by the serving staff (no stress!) And extremely pleased with the food. The brussel sprouts were amazing and very fresh
Pros: 1.) Conveniently located 2.) Parking nearby 3.) (Very?) Good food, tapas-style 4.) Well-priced Cons: 1.) Small and difficult to navigate 2.) Loud (many people talking in a small space) 3.) Almost always busy (can be a very long wait) 4.) Decor OK 5.) OBNOXIOUS wait staff. I used to think my experience was anomalous, until at a bar the other night I overheard other people discussing this. Recommendation: Go! I would rate this higher if it weren't for the staff. The food is good, the price just fine, and the experience worthwhile. However, don't expect to be charmed by the all-too secure wait staff...
One of our favorite restaurants in the whole country. We've had to wait for a table on occasion, but goddamn is it worth it! Their spicy coconut curry wings are one of the best preparations of chicken I've ever tasted. Sweet, meaty, crispy/chewy skin, spicy enough to break a sweat--perfect, in other words. The garlic braised greens are another perfect item. They pack more flavor into this warm salad than some restaurants can muster into a whole menu. Never soggy, never over-seasoned, this is a dish that has inspired countless attempted imitations in our own home to varying degrees of success. The foccaccia is maybe an A-, but a great way to thicken out a meal. We have tried at least a dozen other dishes on their menu and loved them all. Their wine and beer selection make them a destination as well. My ladyfriend likes their wine flight--a sampler of four or more wines. I'm partial to the local Ithaca Brewing varieties on tap (especially the Ground Break seasonal.) We have driven way out of our way on roadtrips to squeeze in a meal here and it is always worth the miles.
This is a tapas bar, and it is high scale. Very quiet and romantic and expensive. They have rare kinds of fish and drinks. The only downside is that its always booked. You would have to stand in the door way for one to two hours and wait for a table or make reservations a week ahead. It is very good for groups of people because you can each share your meals.
This is one of the most romantic spots in Ithaca. Excellent for a first date (I am living proof...I am marrying the man who took me here for our first date while I was an undergrad). The wine flights are enjoyable, and each "taste" is of adequate size and quality. Their flavor sensibility is quite good. I always try to stop here on visits back to Ithaca. They also have a cute outdoor seating area, which is wonderful on the (rare) occasion that the weather is nice in Ithaca.
Delicious and frequently updated tapas menu and nice wine flights. Don't expect much else, but there is a lot to be said for doing one thing and doing it really well.
A friend introduced me to this restaurant and I loved every bit of it.  The selection of tapas was good, and made you want to try every single one of them.  We had the focaccia with roast garlic (yummy), and some other dishes that I can't remember the names of--only that they were amazingly good, and quick to arrive at our table!  The service was very friendly and prompt, without being annoyingly so.
Should be michelin star rated.  Better than any place I've eaten at in California.
What is there not to love about this place? Tapas (small Spanish dishes) that you can share with a group for friends in a decorative back porch that is perfect for a date or just to enjoy on a fine summer day! Almost every main dish and dessert taste very delicious. And don't be afraid to order lots to have your fill. So come down to downtown; you won't be disappointed! Check out their website for hours and sample menu!
I'm really having a hard time understanding why everyone is raving about just a taste. I found the menu to be boring and uninspired. Just a taste is a substandard tapas place. Albeit the interior was nice, but that was completely overshadowed by uncreative dishes and slow service. I would NOT recommend just a taste. In my humble opinion it's not the fantastic tapas restaurant everyone claims it to be.

I think it's the best restaurant in Ithaca.  It is a lovely place to eat with friends, family or go on a date.  JAT has a very warm, friendly atmosphere.  They don't take reservations which is something of a double edged sword.  If you time it right (early in the night) I'd say you can always get in, otherwise it will be a long wait. The food and wine changes seasonally, mostly - they always have some items like the famous Deep Fried Potato wedges, which are a must have.  My favorite item is in the winter - "Brussel Sprouts Sauted in Brown Butter with Garlic, Pecans and Romano Cheese".  I didn't realize how great brussel sprouts can be until I had this. They have outdoor dining in the back in the summer.  It's a nice shaded patio with a fence around it, really nice in the summer except maybe when it is cool. They used to have a brunch, long ago.  I've seen it come and go twice.  If it reappears, go!  It will make any weekend morning wonderful.

This place is wonderful and has some of the best food I've ever had in any restaurant. I was extremely surprised to find a restaurant with such good food in a small city like Ithaca. Make sure you order their foccacia bread with their roasted garlic, which is out of this world. The pricing is definitely fair and the service is pretty good. The only negative about this place is that it is very very small so getting a table is usually very hard. I would suggest you call ahead or go there and plan on walking around the commons for at least 45 minutes.

The only reason I did not give this place 5 stars was because it is pretty cramped seating. Other than that, the food was phenomenal. I took my fiance here for his birthday celebration. The only thing we really didn't care for was the pork. Everything else-the asparagus, cauliflower, strip steak, and a few others, were so delicious. We ordered 5 tapas and that was a perfect amount. I wish we would have tried this place earlier in my trip, I would have come back! Maybe next time.
