As far as Thai food goes this place is nothing exceptional. The Thai fried rice was on the sticky side and was not as flavorful as most places make it. The other reviewer is right about the dishes being less on the sweet side, but coconut flavoring is integral to Thai food and why I often enjoy it.
Forgettable, but the appetizers are on point. Service was not good, our waitress was rude and messed up our orders. She only stopped by our table to take our orders and then to deliver it. We had to flag her down for the check.
I love their food - it's some of the best Thai food I've had. I always get their pad thai or fried rice. Their delivery wait time can be a little bit excessive though (over an hour), especially later in the evening or on weekends.
Their food was quite good, but be warned- they are liberal with the spicing! We both ordered a medium spiciness level (figuring it's upstate NY and they'll probably underspice- I know, we are so biased...) and it was pretty hot. I've heard similar stories from other people who have eaten there. So be warned- good food, but you might want to err on the side of caution.
Oh, Taste of Thai, you wonderful place, you. This is my favorite Thai place that I've been to. Pad See Ew is cooked wonderfully and quick service. Not to mention it's right on the Commons. I've come here multiple times with friends and we have always been pleased. They are also good at accommodating large groups.
Yay for Thai food. I was glad to stumble on such a tasty restaurant while vacationing in Ithaca. Having traveled all the way from Florida via car eating something that wasn't fast food was a priority. This restaurant was recommended by friends, that are locals, I was staying with. It lived up to all the hype. Food is authentic Thai with reasonable prices and good portion sizes. I got the green curry and it was more than enough for two whole meals for myself. The chicken satay was tender and moist with lots of the peanut sauce. The service was okay but they were very busy so I'm sure this played a role.
Serves decent Thai food at an affordable price, with friendly staff. The portions may be small for some, so I recommend ordering appetizers (such as lettuce wraps) before you dig in to your entrees.
Really good Thai place. I started with a cup of Tom Yum soup, which was exactly what I was expecting, tasty and spicy. My friend and I shared our main dishes, and we still couldn't finish, not for lack of trying. All said, a good Thai restaurant, I'd visit again.
Best Thai food in Ithaca. The wait can be a little long sometimes, other than that the service is good.
This is a decent restaurant for thai food but I think it's slight over priced. I've been here a bunch of times and usually order the pad thai. One time I ordered the pad see ew but it was really different than what I'm used to eating in Chicago (it sucked) so I never ordered that again. I've come here with large groups and they are pretty fast with everyone's order so that's a definite plus to this restaurant. There's a ton of thai restaurants in Ithaca and I'd say try Sticky Rice.
Went here for a weekday lunch.  I liked the decor and the menu choices.  The portion size was good too.  Service was good. My noodle dish was a bit heavy in a bland sauce, and my companions thought their dishes were more show than flavor. Still, next time I'm at Cornell I would not mind coming back.
I really like their food.  We've only done take out, and the food can take a while on a Sunday for instance, but the flavors are really good. The ginger basil dish with pork was great, and you cannot go wrong with the tom yum soup.  All the curries we tried hit the spot. ***last time we ordered take out they didn't include a side of rice with the curry, so be sure to ask for rice!!***
Possibly the best Thai food I have eaten. The serving and service is good. Suggest eating noodles with prawns.
There's nothing quite like sitting down and having a family-style thai dinner with share plates and a big pot of rice. A bunch of friends and I ordered gaeng masaman,  thai spicy noodles, pad thai, spicy eggplant, and a shrimp dish. All of them were incredible, but the curry stood out as our favorite. It was just such a perfect blend of sweet and savory and pure deliciousness. I still have dreams about that curry. We had five people in our group, including a dude friend with a massive appetite. Five dishes were absolutely fitting and although we scraped every single main plate clean, we left feeling nicely full but not overstuffed. The only issue I have with this place is the service. Our waitress was nowhere to be seen after taking our order without a pen/paper, showing up only as we were walking out the door. We had several different staff members deliver our food, drop off the check, and brusquely bus our table. We literally sat there awkwardly staring at each other as a random server loudly (and rudely) stacked our tableware into a rickety tower and whisked away to the kitchen without acknowledgement towards us. Talk about lack of customer service. Nevertheless, the food was amazing and you can't overlook that simple fact. Taste of Thai not only reignited my passion for thai food, but also patched up my bad experiences with previous places as well.
Delicious authentic Thai food, beautifully served.  We enjoyed Spring Rolls, Chive Dumplings, Phad Thai, Choo Chi Salmon, and Duck with Pumpkin.  The sauces had just a bit of heat (as requested), and a lot of flavor.  The prices were very reasonable.   The restaurant doesn't serve alcohol, but we were invited to bring our own.   Enjoy!
Absolutely delicious thai food. I ordered green curry with chicken last week, and it was probably the best thai curry I've ever had. The ambience is lacking; it's not very aesthetically pleasing and appears a little grungy/old (which is the only reason I've given this a 4 and not a 5), but don't let the appearance fool you! The food far and away makes the mediocre atmosphere worth it. Besides, you're going for thai food for the FOOD, not the atmosphere, right? Servers were nice, brought water and rice promptly for us spice-wimps. Very reasonably priced. Just a straightforward win when you're looking for purely tasty, satisfying thai food. Can't wait to go back and try something else.
When living in Ithaca for my undergraduate, I could not get enough Taste of Thai. I thought it was sooooo good. Especially the lettuce wraps, Taste of Thai chicken, and green curry beef. On a recent visit, however, I was disappointed. Since living in Ithaca, I have had much better Thai food that is lighter and more flavorful. It was just okay on my return visit. For those not experienced with Thai food, it may still be delicious, but alas the appeal fades with time.
Our group of 20 or so seemed to overwhelm the restaurant, but they did an adequate job of getting our food to us.   I had the Spicy Rad Nah Noodles, spice level 3 (out of 5), which was plenty spicy for me!  Others in our party dared to have level 4, which was probably the upper limit on spiciness able to be supported by a bunch of weak Americans.
I went here summer of 2008 and haven't been back since.  We went for lunch and the service was terrible, I had to flag down service at every point: getting water, ordering, asking for a piece of our order we didn't get, getting our check and paying. The last part, we had been waiting for them to take my money for 10 minutes and my 8 month old was 5 minutes into a meltdown and I still had to literally get up, go to the cash register, pull a server aside and say "excuse me, I'd like to pay now."   I'm willing to overlook such horrible service if the food is good, but the food we ordered was far from it.  I love peanut sauce, but theirs was not good.  The noodles it was served on were a gross texture and tasted like fish.  My friend's vegetable stir fry stuff was bland.  I've heard people say this is their favorite Thai in Ithaca, but I have no idea why.
This restaurant is almost completely empty at the start of the lunch hour, and then packed by the end - though the wait is never longer than a few minutes.  The food is tasty and quick, and the service is just right - they're attentive without being annoying. I've had the pad thai, and another dish involving those giant thick noodles.  The giant thick noodles were perfectly cooked and the spice was just right.  It's definitely the kind of place where you can go to lunch and not wind up in a food coma for the rest of the afternoon - portions are reasonable, as are the prices.
AWFUL. Try Taste of Thai Express or Tamarind instead. Or Sticky Rice. I got a mild upset stomach every time I ate here, so I'm guessing the food is not fresh. The duck curry is fine, as are the fried rice and pad thai dishes (but it's hard to mess up fried rice or pad thai). The other main dishes are gross. Flavorwise, they overdo it. Especially since Asian food already uses a lot of oil and salt--but also with the flavors generally--Taste of Thai's food is overwhelming in a bad way. The food doesn't taste good for Thai food in the States. Service is hit or miss. I once had an obnoxious server who didn't know the difference between the various red curries try to correct me. Rude. Atmosphere is good, nice ambiance. I have been many times--when I first moved to Ithaca, I thought it was the only Thai restaurant lol--but I will never go back.
Spectacular Thai food that lives up to the best Thai restaurants in NYC! I admit it - living in NYC has spoiled me rotten when it comes to ethnic food.  I love Thai food, but have become quite choosy about what I consider good, authentic Thai because let's face it, there are at least a thousand Thai restaurants in NYC.  Taste Of Thai did more than just live up to my favorite Thai restaurants in NYC; it really wowed me! My boyfriend and I had dinner here one night this past July when we were up in Ithaca for a week long vacation in the Finger Lakes region.  He had eaten here the last time he had come up to Ithaca and he raved about it, so I wanted to give this place a try. We started off with the Goong Sarong (prawns dressed in egg noodles golden fried served with a sweet chili dipping sauce) for an appetizer.  Definitely one of THE best and unique Thai dishes I've ever eaten!  For dinner, I had the Gaeng Kiew Pad Hang (dried emerald curry) with chicken, which was amazing.  It was flavorful and had a nice bite to it.  My boyfriend had the Thai Spicy Noodles, which he loved as well. The serivce was really good here as well.  Our server was pleasant and very attentive.  This was the cheapest meal we had all week while we were staying up here and overall, one of the best for the money.  I know I'll be coming back here the next time I am up in Ithaca!
Awesome for a date night. Not the best Thai food in Ithaca, but still very good. I took my girlfriend out for her first experience with Thai food, and she was extremely pleased. We had most of the typical Thai dishes (Tom Yum, Tom Kha Gai, Pad Thai, etc...) and were pleasantly surprised. Unfortunately the spiciness level used is very weak, with the hottest being hot but not to my taste. As far as Thai food in the US is concerned, you can't do much better than this short of the DC metro area/ NYC. And as far as the location is concerned, smack dab in the middle of the commons, and with a very quaint oriental theme on the inside, Taste of Thai served a really enjoyable night.
Excellent pad thai. Definitely get the Thai iced tea. In the world of Thai food, this place is good for the price but quite not the top of the line with food quality. You won't go wrong with it though.
The BEST Thai food I've had any place anywhere and I've been around. Totally fresh and delicious. A must have.
Duck curry is my fav dish on this menu. Fast seating, relatively quick service, good refills with water but the quality that gives this place a 4 star is the authenticity and greatness of the duck curry. The reason its not a 5 is because they are stingy with the duck and charge for extra rice, lame.
This is hands down the best Thai food I have found yet. When I lived in Ithaca I had an absolute addiction to this place. The flavours and seasonings are so bold and well done. Some Thai restaurants just don't do that complimentary mix of bold flavors nearly as well. I do have to mention Tamarind, which is on the other side of town. They also have excellent Thai food in which quality and flavor easily compare to Taste of Thai. I would give 5 stars except that the service is NEVER good here, but I think they know that their food is so good that people will still come back anyways. I now live in Philadelphia, the 5th largest city in the country, and still cannot find a Thai restaurant here that even comes close to Taste of Thai.
A very famous Asian restaurant in Ithaca and really crowded on Friday night. I've been there a couple times and love all the curries. The appetizers, spring rolls, and soup are all pretty good. Simply a nice place to have a joyful dinner with friends. A bit noisy inside, which also makes the place feel more free and casual to chat with close friends.
Best restaurant in Ithaca Commons if not in Ithaca itself and the Best Thai in upstate New York.  Delicious food.  This isn't cheap take out Thai, this is quality, flavorful authentic Thai cuisine.  Highly recommend to anyone who wants real asian food and not the cheap American-Chinese take out.
Forgettable, but the appetizers are on point. Service was not good, our waitress was rude and messed up our orders. She only stopped by our table to take our orders and then to deliver it. We had to flag her down for the check.
The curry, pad see ew, pineapple fried rice are all sooo good here! The service is quick and friendly.  Great place for Thai food.  Would recommend!
Their food was quite good, but be warned- they are liberal with the spicing! We both ordered a medium spiciness level (figuring it's upstate NY and they'll probably underspice- I know, we are so biased...) and it was pretty hot. I've heard similar stories from other people who have eaten there. So be warned- good food, but you might want to err on the side of caution.

This Thai restaurant definitely knows how to up the spiciness -- at least, for me. I LOVE that the spiciness levels (1-5) are actually pretty accurate with regards to the actual spiciness. I got the yellow curry here. It was really tasty, and the portion size was bigger than I expected -- you definitely get your money's worth here :) My only warning about here is that the lunch special does not apply on the weekends. i wish they were more blatant about that on their website/yelp/etc.

Taste Of Thai is great and it is made to order how spicy you like it. They're very well known and have a celebrities like Goldie Hawn and Whoopi Goldberg. Today I had their spring rolls for an appetizer with honey sauce and for the meal I had taste of thai Chicken with cashews and I had deep fried ice cream for dessert. They are always very friendly and the waitress Yuko is always a pleasure. Its a good idea to make reservations because the place fills up fast, it is worth every dollar and I've gone back many times.
Went here for a weekday lunch.  I liked the decor and the menu choices.  The portion size was good too.  Service was good. My noodle dish was a bit heavy in a bland sauce, and my companions thought their dishes were more show than flavor. Still, next time I'm at Cornell I would not mind coming back.
Only Thai place I've been to in Ithaca and its nice that its in the commons.  Everything I had is great and I would recommend this to anyone looking for some spicy Thai food!

As a student, I rarely came here because the restaurant is town in the commons, but when I came back to town I found that Taste of Thai has the best Pad See Ew that I've had anywhere.  The sauce was amazing.  They also had a cozy atmosphere and lots of choices for food.  My friends enjoyed tall glasses of thai iced tea and we were all too full to try to desserts.  I would highly recommend this restaurant!
Possibly the best Thai food I have eaten. The serving and service is good. Suggest eating noodles with prawns.

We've been here for dinner a couple of times, but we more often do carry-out when it's been a long day and we just don't feel like cooking (very convenient, since we live within walking distance of the Commons). It has been a consistently solid experience. My go-to favorite dish is the pineapple curry, but the Pad Kra Pao (spicy basil) is also quite good. My only regret is that despite always asking for the highest spice level, it is never very spicy at all.

I've eaten at Taste of Thai several times now (call me hopeful). The reason I've given it so many chances is that people have told me that it's an amazing place; unfortunately I could not find this amazing place. I only found a place which stole my money and in return gave me mediocre "Thai" food and mild indigestion. I would ask for the $30 that I've spent at TOT back, but chances are with the service there I will have died before receiving it. This place is nothing special, it's the Thai equivalent of Applebee's, lots of flash very little content. You can do much better in Ithaca and I would suggest you do.

Previously the #1 place to bring a visiting professor but lately the food quality has declined.  Still though worth a stop on the Ithaca Thai food tour.   I have fond memories of "mom's cashew chicken" (kinda a Thai version of General Tso's chicken which also means you'll either love it or hate it).  Other than that the food is mostly the standard Thai repertoire. The thai iced tea is good, but Tamarind has better (even though I think they have the same owners).

We had a mixed experience here last week.  The good: our entrees were very tasty.  My wife had the yellow curry and it was very well done.  The bad: the server was smirky and appeared to think very highly of himself. The restaurant was quite loud, and the fried tofu appetizer was very bland.
Love this place! My friends all started with the Thai iced tea (I skipped it because I dislike condensed milk) but all of my friends loved it. Almost every table had ordered Thai iced tea so I felt like the odd one out but it also meant that they have good thai iced tea. I had the special home cooked chicken for my main course. I had no idea what home cooked chicken meant bit it sounded interesting. Turns out it was chicken cooked in a light curry sauce that wasn't too coconut-milky (I dislike coconut milk as well, on top of condensed milk.) It was cooked with cashews and some bell peppers.  Despite my dislike for those particular types of milks, I enjoyed the homecooked chicken. You can choose how spicy you want your food to be on a level of 0-5, so I asked for a level of negative 1 haha. It was definitely not spicy. Lastly, our waiter was very friendly. He is currently a student at community college and always come to our table to talk to us, and was able to make good recommendations.
Awful food and poor service. The server decided to stream me and my partner twice by preparing someone else's dish by our table. Go to MIA instead
This is a nice place to grab some Thai food (okay, I went to Express, but that's splitting hairs at this point:) ).  I enjoyed that their menu had all of the usual Thai standards, as well as a few more creative menu options (an appetizer involving a sweet and savory mix of apples and onions...mmm...).  I also love that they deliver (something that more places in Ithaca need to catch onto!).  When looking for Thai in Ithaca, this is a very solid bet.
Very good food and well priced.  Waitress and staff nice and professional.  All dishes are hot from the kitchen. A lot of dishes tasted pretty good!
Good food, with a nice combination of tradition with some options for adventure.  A wide range of good eats.  Tolerant of a family with small children wanting to share dishes.  A good economical find.
Came here with a group of bros for an almost-end-of-semester celebratory dinner recently. We all had a different kind of curry. I had the Panang curry with beef and it was pretty good, a little too sweet though. I loved that the coconut flavor is still there. It is one of my pet peeves when I order coconut curry and I don't taste the goddamned cocos! I think they messed up my order because I had a spicier curry than my friend and I ordered no spice whereas he ordered the highest spice level. Overall the food was very savory and pretty satisfying. Price was not great but I can deal. Probably will not come here again unless I have an insane curry craving.

This place is OK, not amazing. Does the trick if you're in the mood for some super greasy and bad for you Thai food, but I wouldn't go here on a regular basis if you're concerned about health in any way.

I came here with a large party to celebrate my friend's birthday. The service was very friendly and accommodating. I was underwhelmed with the appetizers, given the praise I've heard about the restaurant. They tasted like the frozen-esque appetizer's I've had in Asian restaurants around the US (and when I say Asian, I'm completely aware of the distinctions between cuisines - it is just that many of the appetizers (Spring Rolls, Fried Tofu, etc, are all strangely similar). However, when the main course came, the restaurant shined. I had the Panang curry, which was just fantastic. It has a rich coconut base, with enough spices as well as fresh basil to make a wonderful combination. That, combined with the fried banana (as well as cake) at the end, made up for the underwhelming beginning. I would come back, starting instead with a salad, to try those out. (also note, the spice scale is very true, not watered down for Americans. A level 3 is the ideal amount without overwhelming the complexities of the dish).

The Pad See Eew and Green Curry (spicy level #2) were all delicious, but my favorite was the Kai-Kua. The booth seats were arranged back to back and the lady sitting behind me asked if I could sit still. My apologies.
Very good food and well priced.  Waitress and staff nice and professional.  All dishes are hot from the kitchen. A lot of dishes tasted pretty good!
Underwhelming. I went here with two friends last spring and tried Pad Khing (Ginger Delight) -- ginger, scallions, onions, wood ear and shiitake mushrooms with "assorted seafood" (prawns, mussels, squid, scallops). It was pretty good, but I'm spoiled by places like Thai Cuisine (near Wegmans), Erawan in Syracuse, etc. It was similarly priced but the quality did not live up and the taste just didn't explode in my mouth the way I've come to expect with Thai food.

I think they messed up my order because I had a spicier curry than my friend and I ordered no spice whereas he ordered the highest spice level. Overall the food was very savory and pretty satisfying. Price was not great but I can deal. Probably will not come here again unless I have an insane curry craving.
Picked up some take-out from here... They were good about getting the food out in good order and didn't miss any orders.  The rice was delicious and the spicy scale was a little off, but the food was great. A 3 on the spicy scale is more than a medium.
This place is OK, not amazing. Does the trick if you're in the mood for some super greasy and bad for you Thai food, but I wouldn't go here on a regular basis if you're concerned about health in any way.
I had the Taste of Thai Chicken. It was quite good. I can't recall what everyone else in my party had but it ranged from Thai Salad to some curry dish. It was very tasty and relatively inexpensive.
I came here with a large party to celebrate my friend's birthday. The service was very friendly and accommodating. I was underwhelmed with the appetizers, given the praise I've heard about the restaurant. They tasted like the frozen-esque appetizer's I've had in Asian restaurants around the US (and when I say Asian, I'm completely aware of the distinctions between cuisines - it is just that many of the appetizers (Spring Rolls, Fried Tofu, etc, are all strangely similar). However, when the main course came, the restaurant shined. I had the Panang curry, which was just fantastic. It has a rich coconut base, with enough spices as well as fresh basil to make a wonderful combination. That, combined with the fried banana (as well as cake) at the end, made up for the underwhelming beginning. I would come back, starting instead with a salad, to try those out. (also note, the spice scale is very true, not watered down for Americans. A level 3 is the ideal amount without overwhelming the complexities of the dish).
Favorite Thai food in Ithaca. The yellow curry is really good, as is the pad thai. I usually just get takeout, and then the leftovers last for days: curry on rice, curry on noodles, pad Thai in curry... So nice. Actually, the leftovers don't last that long, though they would if I wasn't so hungry all the time. The drunken noodles are also very good, but they can be spicy.
The Pad See Eew and Green Curry (spicy level #2) were all delicious, but my favorite was the Kai-Kua. The booth seats were arranged back to back and the lady sitting behind me asked if I could sit still. My apologies.
OK, I must admit that I do rag on Ithaca's food scene quite a bit.  The isolated nature of the town makes the food very hit or miss. Recently, we had a very nice meal at Taste of Thai in the commons.  We wanted to order the exact same dishes that we had at Thai cuisine and compare the two.  Here we go: Appetizers: Thai Cuisine: Chicken Satay- The satay was overcooked and somehow cold (not lukewarm, cold... as if it had been in a fridge.  Nasty.  Also, portions were small. Tom yum soup- VERY salty and somehow a little bland.  Not spicy at all!  Very disappointing. Taste of Thai: Chicken Satay- Huge, warm, moist chicken on skewers.  Served with a peanut sauce (out of a bottle).  Very good. Tom yum soup- You can alter the spice level from 0 (wuss) to 5 (tough guy).  I went with 5 and the soup knocked my socks off.  Very spicy but still tasty at the same time.  Very good. Entree: Thai Cuisine: Drunken Noodles (Pad Kee Mao)- Ordered it "as spicy as you can make it".  Was not spicy at all.  The noodles were undersauced.  Very bland.  More like Chinese Chow fun than drunken noodles. Panang Curry- Strange vegetables for a panang.  Also, sauce was very bland (although, admittedly my date ordered it mild, so....).  Not bad, but not great. Taste of Thai: Drunken Noodles- Ordered it 5/5 on the spicy scale.  It packed some heat!  Not too much, but you could taste it.  Also, the noodles were properly sauced and cooked.  Very good. Panang Curry- Your standard panang.  Again, my GF ordered it mild.  This time the panang was not flavorless, however.  Pretty solid. Overall, Taste of Thai was superior in every way.  The only drawback that I can see is that it can be noisy.  Also, the space inside is a little cramped and you can feel a little rushed (depending on how busy they are). Best Thai food we've had in Ithaca.
Underwhelming. I went here with two friends last spring and tried Pad Khing (Ginger Delight) -- ginger, scallions, onions, wood ear and shiitake mushrooms with "assorted seafood" (prawns, mussels, squid, scallops). It was pretty good, but I'm spoiled by places like Thai Cuisine (near Wegmans), Erawan in Syracuse, etc. It was similarly priced but the quality did not live up and the taste just didn't explode in my mouth the way I've come to expect with Thai food.
While on a business trip to Ithaca i had a craving for some yellow curry, so reading some of the reviews here i was really excited about trying Taste of Thai. I was somewhat disappointed. The yellow curry was so/so. I got a 3out of 5  on the heat scale, and it had no heat to it. In addition it almost tasted like they added a bit to much cornstarch or flour to the curry to thicken it. It satisfied my craving for the time being, but i will be probably go to another Thai restaurant next time i crave curry in the Ithaca area.
Best Thai ever had in the US.  Hands down.
Low quality!  We ate here and the staff did not correctly disclose an important ingredient when asked specifically about it.  When I got the food, I could not eat it due to the fish sauce -- it stunk of fish.   When I expressed concern, the staff was not helpful at all -- no replacement, no refund.  I will never spend money at this place again.

We've eaten here a few times during our visits to Cornell. The food is good, and the service is friendly. We've tried most of the menu and found everything to be enjoyable, but my personal favorite is the panang curry with beef or vegetables.

I've gotten Taste of Thai Express takeout many times but never went to Taste of Thai, so I decided to go with my mother and boyfriend when my mother was visiting me a few weeks ago. First off, decor is lovely inside and servers were nice.  We ordered 2 appetizers, the spring rolls (fried) and chicken satay.  The spring rolls were alright, nothing special, and the chicken satay was a bit dry and also ordinary.  More puzzling was the fact that the satay was served with toasted white bread cut into triangles.  Kind of a cop out as a garnish or complement to the dish. For entrees, I had the pineapple curry (w/ veg) which was once again, nothing special.  My mother had the emerald green curry (w/beef) which was far too salty.  My boyfriend had one of the fried noodle dishes and boy were those rice noodles over cooked.  Limp, mushy, and greasy.  Luckily, this time there were more vegetables + meat than noodles.  We each requested our dish to be a Level 3 spicy.  Now, typically at Taste of Thai Express, a Level 3 spicy is very, very hot.  It is Thai level spicy, not American level spicy.  At Taste of Thai however, Level 3 barely registered to us, and we all LOVE spicy food. Our original waitress also never returned to ask us how our food was, so we had to flag down a different waitress and ask her for extra hot condiments. Overall, the experience was unremarkable and I highly doubt I will ever return.  There are far superior Thai restaurants in the area.  At least they gave us 50% off the Emerald Green Curry, after complaining that it was too salty.

I usually just get takeout, and then the leftovers last for days: curry on rice, curry on noodles, pad Thai in curry... So nice. Actually, the leftovers don't last that long, though they would if I wasn't so hungry all the time. The drunken noodles are also very good, but they can be spicy.
My boyfriend and I decided to try taking some food to go from here earlier in the week. It was my first time ever going to Taste of Thai. I checked the website and saw that they did do to go orders, so I figured it wouldn't be a problem if we just went in and ordered something to pick up after walking the Commons for a bit. Boy, was I wrong! We should have called ahead, because when we got there, no one seemed to know what to do with us. I asked the waitress that came to seat us if we could order a to go order and she looked around and mumbled something about being right back before walking away. We were then ignored by every server in the restaurant, even though many were walking by or around us, or were standing at the bar about 5 feet from us. As we stood there, I noticed one server working his butt off, moving around to serve his tables as quickly as possible while keeping a smile on his face, even as one group called after him rudely twice (DO NOT call out or snap your fingers at a server please - it's just plan rude - they have other guests to tend to as well!!!!!). We decided it wasn't worth it to wait since no one had acknowledged us, and I was feeling very disappointed since I had assumed it wouldn't be a problem to walk in off the Commons to order food to go (I can't imagine were the only people that walk the Commons and then want to take food home with us). As we walked out, the one server who was working his butt off was headed out as well to deliver some food to guests. He realized we were leaving and told us as soon as he dropped off the food, he could take our order, but understood if we didn't want to wait any longer. Because he was so nice and not pushy about it, we decided to wait for him. He came right back into us and took our order. After placing our order with him, we left to wander on the Commons. We came back only about 20 minutes later, and I wasn't expecting the food to be ready yet. Our server came back to us and informed us the food was indeed ready! He quickly finished up our transaction and sent us on our way. When we got home with our food, we were glad to find out from our receipt that our server's name was Jerome! He did such a fantastic job, and without him, Taste of Thai would have lost our business - we probably would have just gone back to Sticky Rice. The food was fantastic! I had Thai Rice with Chicken, it was very tasty...and I even ate my entire portion at once, which is a rarity for me! That mean's it was just the right size and DELICIOUS!!! I will definitely be going back to Taste of Thai, thanks to Jerome! Erin says...you suck for not having a better system to take walk-in, to-go orders, you rock for the food and JEROME!

I had a dinner party there a few weeks ago and it went so well that it inspired me to write this review. I'm no This food connoisseur but all the times I've been there, the food is great. My one gripe is that the spiciness level is inconsistent, which is easily remedied by asking for the spice rack. Service is great and they were not annoyed at all when my party of 15 grew to a party of 21! Furthermore, when we paid the bill (with gratuity included) and we overpaid, they tried to return us the money! I would highly recommend this place.

The food at Taste of Thai is rather good--I've had some excellent Rama Noodles, sweet and sour Priew Wan, lime soda, and Thai iced tea, and I've never heard a complaint about the food from anyone I've taken there to dine with me. It gets a little crowded because it's a restaurant on the commons, but the food is delicious. However, when I was a college student, I felt as if some of the wait staff looked down on me or didn't expect me to tip based on my age. Because of that, our table was ignored, we didn't get any refills on our drinks, and rather than asking us if we wanted dessert, we were simply handed the check without a thank you or a goodbye. We actually had planned on ordering dessert (which would have added to our waitress's tip on an already very expensive bill), but we just paid and left, disappointed and reluctant to go back. I've still been back to Taste of Thai since then (with varying levels of service, ranging from passable to pretty good), but my new preferred Thai restaurant in Ithaca is Thai Cuisine on South Meadow. The service is more consistent and the food is, in my opinion, significantly better.

Good food, but the service can be a little weird.  Our server was so super awkward it made us uncomfortable.

I loved the whole experience! Its value for money ! The red panang curry is a must try!

A standard Thai restaurant with pretty good food.  The prices aren't too outrageous either.  The reason it doesn't get a higher rating is because they are inconsistent with how spicy they make dishes.

I feel like all the Thai places in Ithaca are pretty good. Taste of Thai continues the trend.  They have a good location (on the commons), good service, and a nice dining room.

Went here for lunch.  Not bad, have had better.
Good food, but the service can be a little weird.  Our server was so super awkward it made us uncomfortable.
So average. Super bland, barely any spice for anything even resembling Thai food and not even close to most restaurants in NYC. If you know what good Thai food tastes like, you probably won't find what you're looking for here.

Somewhere, somebody at some point got the idea that there was some sort of "famous" Thai restaurant in Ithaca.  This is resounding crap.  That being said, Taste of Thai is pretty darn good. Taste of Thai is good.  The red curry is good, as are their other numerous and excellent dishes.  Of course, this is far from a surprise: this place is routinely packed with happy customers, and justifiably so. Still, don't buy into the obtuse hype about Taste of Thai being famous for one reason or another - I'm not sure where it came from, but it's somewhat manufactured.  This place is a fine restaurant, but to my knowledge it's just that.  Enjoy it for what it is, not the nebulous idea that it might be famous for some reason.

I've been informed that the last manager (one* rating) has left and another manager, more focused on customer appreciation is now running Taste of Thai. Hopefully this change will make a significant difference in the quality of overall dining service. /// I'll go back in soon and see if this is what I experience. That one-star experience didn't make me want to return very quickly.

I ordered for delivery through EatStreet and without exaggeration, it literally took over 2 hours from the time I placed my order till I received it. I called the restaurant and they blamed it on EatStreet for the order taking 30 minutes to come through, which was a lie, as I spoke to EatStreet who said they emailed and faxed the restaurant immediately upon receiving my order. Taste of Thai didn't offer me any consolation or estimate of when I would receive my order after 90 minutes had passed. Just ridiculous. I will never order from here again.

overpriced andoverrated(´･･`) I would recommend thai basil rather than this place. I've been coming to this place for about a year and I have realized that most dishes have far more vegetables and sauces than necessary. The taste is generic and mediocre. The portion is also kind of small. Now switching to thai basil.

Hands down the best Thai in Ithaca! I went to school here 8 years ago, came back to town, had the same meal and it tasted as if I never left. You cant go wrong with the Pad See Ew with chicken or the green curry.  It has the perfect amount of seasoning and spice. For appetizer order the spring rolls it's light and flavorful. Make sure you try this place at least once if your ever in the commons.

Was at upstate and tried to find something that's not so rich for easy dinner and wasn't sure how Asian food is like in the upstate. We bumped into this place which had a line so we figured, this place must be good..........WRONG. We all ordered stir-fried noodles as we didn't feel like eating a full meal. Restaurants usually have big stove and big wok so stir-fried noodle shouldn't take that long.......WRONG AGAIN. It seriously took a long time. A large group who sat across from us got their dishes already even though they ordered later than we did. Although we do suspect that the kitchen forgot our order but still................. When the food finally came, it wasn't amazing; in fact it wasn't even to scale. Let's start off by the fact that the portion is pretty small yet it wasn't cheap. All stir-fried ranges from 11-14. For that price you can actually have a pretty decent portion in the city (Am I wrong to assume food in upstate would be cheaper?!?!? Not to mention this is a college town - serving several students who are always looking to save). Then the food wasn't even properly cooked. They literally grabbed the wide-flat noodle from the fridge, didn't even bother to soaked them in hot water to soften the texture, then dumped them into the wok - that's why the noodle wasn't fully cooked but then burnt on the surface. It's annoying enough to wait for forever for the food but then to find out it's not even cooked properly.... I also ordered the Tom Yum soup which was indicated on the menu that you can order this in 0 spiciness. The soup came; did it taste spicy? Yes it did. As for the service it was ok; some are friendlier than others, but I'm seriously wondering how the long line happened. Perhaps their entree dishes taste better but COME.ON.

I occasionally get take out from here, and I find the food is average at best. Not the best in Ithaca, but will do in a pinch. But the service...the worst. On the handful of occasions where I've dined in here, they've messed up my order almost every time. From minor forgivable mistakes like chicken instead of beef in my Pad Thai, to flagrantly terrible mistakes like giving me the wrong dish and then having the gall to be totally unapologetic about it. Just pathetic.

I have been 4-5 times and on a Friday or Saturday night and it'd be best to get a reservation. There isn't a lot of standing room in the waiting area so you might have to stand outside in the cold. Everyone is trying to stay out of the doorway for people coming in and out is not a good setup.  The restaurant is very small and crowded service is ok but not great but not terrible. They are really busy so that makes it hard. As for the food I feel the food compared to other Thai I have had is average standard Thai food but nothing great. The lettuce wraps were pretty good though.  So all in all 3 out of 5. The bathrooms are DISGUSTING.  Its like an outhouse its very small dark and dirty.  That a huge minus for me wondering where they cook my food is anything like that scary...
I have been 4-5 times and on a Friday or Saturday night and it'd be best to get a reservation. There isn't a lot of standing room in the waiting area so you might have to stand outside in the cold. Everyone is trying to stay out of the doorway for people coming in and out is not a good setup.  The restaurant is very small and crowded service is ok but not great but not terrible. They are really busy so that makes it hard. As for the food I feel the food compared to other Thai I have had is average standard Thai food but nothing great.

Delicious, high quality food. Varied menu. Appetizer came out kind of slowly. Service in general was good but on the slow side because they were understaffed. Would definitely come back though.

Had the red duck curry and it was great. Went with 3/5 for spice rating which was more than enough for this little Australian

Standard Thai food. They make excellent curries especially the Panang curry. I'm not such a big fan of their Pad Thai though. You will have to wait a bit at dinner time because its located right in the centre of town

To be honest, I prefer Taste of Thai Express over this place. We came here early on a Friday night and it was already packed. It'd be best to get a reservation. I was seated within fifteen minutes though. There isn't a lot of standing room in the waiting area so you might have to stand outside in the cold. The staff is very attentive despite the number of customers. We never had to wait around to get anyone's attention and the food still comes out fast when the place is busy. We got the gaeng masaman, pad kratiam prik thai, and pad priew wan. We got a different meat for each so that we had variety. While we enjoyed the curry, the other two plates could have used some work. Nothing about either of those two was memorable at all, and portions were pretty small. Make sure you ask for a certain spiciness. When we ordered, they never asked us how spicy we wanted the curry and it didn't come out spicy at all, even though the menu would say there's a scale. Each of us had a Thai tea as well, and it came out to $16.50 per person. Not a bad price for Thai food (I've seen worse), but food quality could have been a bit better to meet that price.

By far my favorite restaurant in Ithaca, if not the world. The food is amazing. I haven't had a bad dish here and I have slowly made my way through the majority of the menu. The service is equally amazing; the staff are super friendly and know me by name. I honestly have not had a bad experience here. My boyfriend and I eat here at least once a week, usually more. We go through withdrawal when we are out of town or unable to go out to dinner here. There isn't an adequate way to sum up this restaurant in a Yelp review, so I really am not going to try. But I absolutely love it.

Pro: The food is actually pretty good. Some stuff is phenomenal (4.5 star), other dishes are actually closer to 1 star, but on average I'd put this at 3. Con: Everything else.  The bathrooms are DISGUSTING.  One of the stalls in the men's bathroom doesn't lock. The other doesn't flush. That's not a good combination.  The service is mixed - some good, some bad. The worst part was just the general inability of the owners/employees to control their restaurant.   During my lunch this past weekend, there was a crazy woman (but a regular customer, apparently) SHOUTING and YELLING for almost a full 45 minutes at the management.  She was self-proclaimed "local activist with no power", a white woman with long white hair, trying to defend the poor defenseless thai restaurant from the bar next door which played their music a bit too loud. (The music was bothering no one except this woman, and wasn't really loud). Instead of speaking with the place next door, this crazy woman was literally yelling and screaming for my entire lunch at the tase of thai employees and management, and the management did nothing about it.  They didn't ask her to leave, they didn't move her to another area of the restaurant, they didn't speak with her outside.  It was absolute madness - I've never seen anything like it. For that alone, I would not be back.

Meh. Ithaca seems to have quite a few Thai places and out of the ones that I've tried, I would not recommend this one. I came for my birthday one year and remember a disappointing meal. The service was slow, though I will note that it was a busy night. I ordered Pad Kee Mao (drunken noodles) and it wasn't spicy at all, even though I asked for 5. If it isn't spicy, it just tastes like Americanized Chinese ho fun with basil. The portions were also small for the prices.

I have ordered from Taste of Thai a million times but I could not believe the service I received on one occasion.  I ordered a meal to be delivered.  TWO HOURS WENT BY AND I STILL HAD NOT RECEIVED MY MEAL.  I had called and was assured it would be there but clearly something went wrong.  I called up grub hub and canceled my food bc after 2.5 hours I had some place else to be.  I left my house and received a call that they were at my apt with my food.  I informed them that I canceled my order.  This was a crazy bad delivery experience and has not been my typical experience with them.  What a let down.  I felt betrayed by my favorite thai place.

I love dining here. This is a perfect restaurant to take on a date! I always order the lettuce wraps because the meat inside is extremely delicious and savory, while being a lower calorie option. The pad Thai dish was also really great!

Went for lunch and got the Spicy Thai Basil Noodles. They were pretty amazing but it is just as amazing as a few other Thai place's I've been too. That's not to say though that it was bad but definitely not 5 stars as it wasn't the best I've ever had. I would definitely go back though, the service was good, it was nice and cool on a hot day and the food was great. Very well priced too! For the price it was definitely the best! I will definitely go back here in the future for lunch.

Ithaca does Thai food fairly well, so unlike for other cuisines, I hand out no "Ithaca sympathy stars" in this category. I think this place is marginally better than Taste of Thai Express, but also slightly more expensive. This is my go to place when I want Laab, a spicy ground meet salad with lime juice, fish sauce and chilies. The curries and noodle dishes are business as usual, good but not fantastic. The spiciness scale (1-5), is really inconsistent here. In general though, I think 1-3 means almost no spice at all (warning: I have heard some people who don't like spice complain about a 3 being too hot but I honestly can't tell the difference most of the time between a 1 and a 3 here). The difference between a 3 (still almost no spice) and a 4 (medium hot) is pretty drastic. A 5, my preferred choice, is reasonably spicy but not insane. If you are a pepper head I really recommend asking the server if you could do a 6 or 7 (say you've eaten here before and that a 5 is not spicy enough).

Hands down the best pineapple fried rice I've ever eaten. Full of flavor slightly sweet goodness.

My boyfriend and I hit this place on Saturday night. I was still recovering from a wild Friday night and was desperately in need of a good meal. Taste of Thai was perfect! Our host/waiter was helpful and good-humored, the atmosphere was relaxing, and we had to wait for maybe a minute for a table despite the fact that the restaurant was packed. Admittedly, neither of us are terribly well-versed in Thai food, but we were both very happy when we left. We shared a plate of spring rolls, and I got the Massaman curry with an iced Thai coffee while he had the cashew chicken. We had more than enough for leftovers, and I'm looking forward to heating it all up tonight for dinner.

I am giving Taste of Thai (on the Commons) such a low rating because of the astonishingly nasty service.  I have tried multiple times now and it is always the same thing, so I cannot go back, ever again. Taste of Thai Express is much, much better- I give them a lot of business and 3 stars. If the owners care at all and if they ever read their reviews, I would respectfully urge them to evaluate their staff at The Commons location. I am overly nice when I go out and I tip well. I have a great amount of empathy for what service people do because I do it myself. But with all the ambivalent-to-rude service I have now experienced in my travels, I am honestly trying to recall if I have ever been treated with such inexplicable and downright bazaar rudeness. With the exception of one nice guy, the staff is weirdly angry and openly hostile. Do not even think of asking a simple question like, "Could you please leave out the peas?" or being so obnoxious as to order tea, believing that maybe you will receive it. Unless the "nice guy" is your server (how does he stand working there? Don't they pool tips?)... Taste of Thai Express has much, much nicer staff and better prices. They are always very friendly and helpful and their delivery guys are great. The food is good enough that I order frequently, but I think Sticky Rice's is better quality. If you are looking for less expensive, Taste of Thai Express is the better value. If you like the coconut milk soup (Tom Ka Gai) TOTE makes the best for Ithaca. Also, their Pad Kee Mao with pork is quite good. Greasy, but good. The Pad Thai is tasty in-and-of-itself, but not the best, by a long shot. I never order appetizers because they are overpriced by a couple dollars for what you get. It is like much better Chinese takeout- Thai food. I love Ithaca, but man is it overpriced! We need better quality value places to eat.

I think Taste of Thai might deserve about 3.5 stars, but closer to four so thus my rating. This is my favorite Thai place in the area, hands down. And I don't think I've had tastier duck curry anywhere else, and I eat a lot of Thai food. I love the mix of rich and subtle flavors of this dish: the sharper taste of fresh green bell peppers mingling with the softer, more rounded flavors of the red and yellow ones over basic eggplant (cooked so it is not too soggy, not too hard) and juicy grape tomato. Then there are the added tones of tangy grapes, sweet lychee, and citrus-y pineapple prepared with red curry past. Everything is smoothed over by the coconut milk into one well-balanced entree. Awesome. I've tried other dishes here also: the pad-thai (go-to thai noodle dish), pad-see eew (also a noodle dish), the choo-chee (fish in red curry), the khao pad sapparod (pineapple fried rice), and various curry dishes. All of them were good; I was never disappointed. Some of the appetizers are pretty good too (especially the som tum: papaya salad). Note: the spring rolls are really, really hot when they come out, so yes, they're wonderfully fresh, but will burn the crap out of your mouth. I starving when they got to the table the first time I ordered them, so I crunched into them right away, and, let me tell you, it wasn't pretty... but it was so, so goooood.... One thing I didn't like about Taste of Thai was that, while this place is good, some dishes are a bit more than I would usually pay for. Also, there can be a huge wait, especially if you come in a group. Look, I love Thai food and all, but I sometimes find myself wondering if the wait is actually worth it when there are some other tasty places to eat in the Commons. Moreover, I usually go with a group of friends, 5 or more. The bigger the group, the longer the wait, and possibly the more crowded and awkward the seating. But if you want to come here on a casual date, then I would definitely recommend it.

This place blows mad chunks. Their curries are clearly made from a can. I only came here because Sticky Rice Carry Out is closed on Mondays. Home-made Soup (Our house specialty; a combination of prawns, squid, Napa cabbage, baby corn, shiitake mushrooms and scallions in a rich broth), cup: $3.95 -If this soup is their "house specialty," then their other soups must taste like raw sewage. This soup was just hot salty water and some veggies thrown in. There was barely any seafood in here, it was mostly cabbage and corn. AVOID. Panang Curry with tofu (Choice of meat, bell peppers, kaffir lime leaves, and Thai basil prepared with panang curry paste and coconut cream), $11.50 -WAY TOO SALTY. This curry was clearly made from a can (they say 'panang curry PASTE' in the description), probably the Maesri Panang Curry paste can (priced at $1.35 on Amazon). Portions were tiny. The cup of rice served with this curry was also tiny. If you wanted another cup of rice, you had to pay $1.00 more. What kind of bullshit is that? I've made better curry myself with the Maesri pastes and the whole meal only cost a couple dollars while also yielding leftovers for a whole week. As a Thai restaurant, they could do WAY better. Service was ok, decor was nice, FOOD SUCKED. Never coming back. Sticky Rice Carry Out is the best.

3.5 Stars I finally got to see Taste of Thai for myself with a couple of friends over the weekend. This place gets PACKED easily, as it is one of the premier restaurants around Ithaca and at the Commons. It's better to make reservations, even if it's only for two, just so you know you have a spot and not have to wait anywhere between ten minutes and an hour. With the six of us, we got lucky and only had to wait fifteen minutes to get a table. We sampled a myraid of entrees: sweet and sour vegetables, red curry, yellow curry, spicy noodles, and pineapple fried rice. The curries and the fried rice were universal hits, while the spicy noodles and sweet and sour entree were good, but not amazing. One point of contention is the spicy level that Taste of Thai utilizes, and we can't seem to figure out. Any dish that warranted the spicy scale was chosen at level three, and the actual level differed by dish. Having coconut milk in the entrees certainly seemed to have diluted the spice, but we were left puzzled. Nevertheless, great food, great ambience. Our waitress was really sweet. Another note: If one wants to split the check in a group, you can do only do a maximum of three ways.

I think that most people that eat Tahi food on a semi- regular bais, or mroe frequently, enjoy it more than I.  Thus, those people who like this palce as much as I do just might rate it higher.  Having said that  the food here  is consistently good....  Last time i was here I had the pineapple fried rice which was splendid... One minue is that they don't have green tea ice cream.. I don't think that that is actually a Thai desert.. It is just something I am used to enjoying at Thai restuarants.  . Please note that the above is from last August.   It was meant to be a sreview of Taste of Thai, but I mistakenly posted the review to the a different Thia restuarant in Ithaca (one that I have never even been too)

If I can give this place a negative one star I would - I think this is my first one star rating on yelp and I dare to say I don't feel bad about it.   We got seated towards the back of the restaurant where you have a partial view of the kitchen and I instantly got this feeling that the restaurant's cleanliness is questionable.  However, we hadn't eaten all day and this was one of the few restaurants that was open at 4pm on a saturday in Ithaca Commons.   Anyhow, we ordered the chicken wings with chili thai sauce, pad thai, rah nah, and a curry dish.  When the chicken wings arrived, we were famished and we started chowing down on it unless my sister got halfway through and noticed it was uncooked...ewwww.  The waiter did a good job of appeasing us by taking the food away and having them recook it.  The second round of wings were ok but needless to say that kinda ruined our experience.  My pad thai was also really dry and boring but at that point, we just wanted to fill our stomach, eat as fast as we can and get out of there.   I would say do not go to this place unless u can absolutely not find any other place to eat at!

Very Good Pad Thai!  That is all that really needs to be said, this stop in Ithaca is a sure thing for lunch or dinner.   I travel as part of my job, and Ithaca is a nice place.   Stop in for the the tasty Thai, but don't stay long...  From the numerous head shops and the words of the locals, the only thing to do here is climb out to the Gorge and get stoned.  I did see a dude with GIANT dreads smoking a GIANT spliff in public...  oh upstate new york....

I order delivery from them very fequently, at least twice a week. Although delivery sometimes get messed up, their pad thai, druken noodle, tom yum, panang curry are always good! I highly recommend this place.

Mmmm... Thai. I have to say that Taste of Thai is the best Thai food in town. The food is great and the price is right. On my last last visit I went with 4 other people and we mixed and shared our entrees. The Pad Kee Mao (a basil stir-fry dish and my usual choice at any Thai restaurant) was great and I also tried a green chili sea bass (a special that night), a yellow curry, the Pad Thai, and the spicy drunken something. The Pad Thai was probably good - but I just can't get excited over Pad Thai anywhere. Too boring. Now - and this part is important - Taste of Thai has completely altered my opinion of Thai curries. I have hated them for years because there is always too much coconut milk and they come out too sweet. These guys got it just right for me - a sweetness balanced by delicate spicing - rather than just mixing up a bunch of coconut milk and chili peppers. Awesome. The best part? They deliver too!

It's not great, but not horrible. I'd say it definitely middle of the road Thai food that won't knock your socks off, but will fix your cravings.

I think these guys long took the "best Thai in Ithaca" mantle long ago, and a recent stop back into my hometown reaffirmed that fact. The food is fairly priced, and spiciness is actual - not merely a suggestion. Ive had a ton of Thai in California, and this place actually beats the average i've found in NorCal. Can't go wrong here so go. What you waiting for?

Friendly staff, clean and delicious food. You must try their yellow curry and of course Thai iced tea.

This is not the best Thai food in Ithaca. My friends and I love Thai food, and usually go to Ithaca's other Thai places, but gave Taste of Thai a try because we were downtown, and it was close. We started with a pot of their Tom Yum soup, level 4 spiciness. The soup lacked complexity and depth of flavor - it tasted of broth with chili flakes, and was not as spicy as we had requested. The other dishes we ordered were equally uninspiring. The tofu in my Pad Ped was overcooked and tough, and somehow the eggplant was undercooked. My husband's dish was underspiced - he ordered heat level 4, and could hardly taste the spice. My other friend's green bean dish was the only one that seemed to be satisfactory. The service was awkward - they had placed little appetizer plates on each setting, underneath the napkins, and after we had all settled in and ordered, the server asked us to pass her the little plates. This resulted in awkward maneuvering of the napkins (we hadn't undone them yet) to get to the plates, and then pass them forward. Consensus - we're going to avoid Taste of Thai, and stick to the places where we know the food is well-prepared, tastes good, and where the service is a little more polished.

I went recently and got the spicy rad nah. While it was decently spicy, it wasn't very complex and the presentation wasn't great either. The portion size was also slightly smaller than I expected. But I'm also used to the food from Taste of Thai Express, which is run by different people, and in my opinion is better. I will say that Taste of Thai has an excellent location and if you're looking for convenience more than anything else, it can't be beat. But if quality is a factor, there are better options.

Taste of Thai was not only one of my favorite restaurants in Ithaca, but a favorite of several friends as well. I was never disappointed with my meal, though I generally got the same thing. The service was always good - not exceptional, but pleasant and adequate, and the atmosphere is social, yet comfortable and cozy. I haven't had a lot of Thai food, but Taste of Thai was a memorable introduction!

Yum! I love this place. The pineapple fried rice is really good here; they put in more than just the typical veggies, pineapple, and cashews. They also add in raisins and chinese sausage. So yummy. The restaurant itself is cute, decorations are nice and the dishes they serve you on are usually jade-colored and I guess v. typically (or stereotypically) "Thai-looking" or whatever. Mood lighting and tablecloths and cloth napkins make this a date place. Portions are sort of smaller so it's not that easy to share dishes with a big group (unless you order multiple of certain dishes) but everything is really delicious. The pad thai here is really good too. It's not too sweet and not too savory, perfect balance. Highly recommend you visit this place if you're in the commons!

In a place full of Thai restaurants, it's hard to differentiate yourself as a Thai restaurant in Ithaca. I went with my friends on a Sunday night and the service was great. We were a huge group of loud, boisterous college kids and they were so nice to us. The food selection is really solid, all the types of Thai food you would expect. I was a little disappointed my thing wasn't spicier (I love spicy food), but it was still good. All the noodle dishes seem solid, pineapple fried rice, and I got garlic and pepper pork. It was pretty decent, a little on the salty side. The fried banana was amazing, straight out of the oven so I almost burned the roof of my mouth. Great atmosphere for casual/business casual dining and decent Thai food. The prices aren't too bad either.

So I've been on a quest for the best cashew chicken... I've had a LOT of cashew chicken (you can't go wrong!) and this is the best I've ever had. Nice and spicy, too. Sadly, I've only been to Taste of Thai once because I transferred schools and am no longer in Ithaca. So I can't speak to anything else about the restaurant, except the facility was decent and the atmosphere was fun because everyone was enjoying their food and company. When I get back to Ithaca, I'm going to Taste of Thai.

Get the choo-chee ... Four-star spicy is the perfect amount for spice. Crispy!

By far the best Thai Restaurant I have been to in Ithaca thus far. Had the Pad Thai for lunch today. It comes with a small bowl of vegetable soup which was quite cute. The pad thai was very fresh and delicious. I love how the bean sprouts are extremely fresh and the pad thai was not greasy at all. I hate how when I order pad thai at other restaurants sometimes and it's so greasy that I can't eat more than a few bites. But NOT THE CASE HERE! Happily finished my meal. Also, the soy sauce is not very heavy and salty, which is a plus. All in all the meal was great and refreshing with just the right amount. Will definitely go again!
Probably the best Thai in Ithaca, although is there much comparison? Mmm....I really liked their curry that is all made with coconut milk. Definitely a good place to take your parents to when visiting Ithaca, Cornell, or Ithaca College. There's also an express location w/o the ambiance: yelp.com/biz/taste-of-th…
There are a number of Thai restaurants in Ithaca and the surrounding area, and this is definitely one of them.  Out of habit, more than anything, we've come here once a year for the past few years.) House salad with warm peanut dressing was ho-hum, and the vegetarian pad thai was bland.  (My dining partner reports that the shrimp in the shrimp pad thai were tasteless.) Our primary server was friendly and helpful, but I believe our secondary server may have been in a trance. This place is always busy and it has a nice decor, but the food is usually a bit of a letdown. Remind us to try someplace different next year.
As far as Thai food goes this place is nothing exceptional. The Thai fried rice was on the sticky side and was not as flavorful as most places make it. The other reviewer is right about the dishes being less on the sweet side, but coconut flavoring is integral to Thai food and why I often enjoy it.
I love their food - it's some of the best Thai food I've had. I always get their pad thai or fried rice. Their delivery wait time can be a little bit excessive though (over an hour), especially later in the evening or on weekends.
Oh, Taste of Thai, you wonderful place, you. This is my favorite Thai place that I've been to. Pad See Ew is cooked wonderfully and quick service. Not to mention it's right on the Commons. I've come here multiple times with friends and we have always been pleased. They are also good at accommodating large groups.
Serves decent Thai food at an affordable price, with friendly staff. The portions may be small for some, so I recommend ordering appetizers (such as lettuce wraps) before you dig in to your entrees.
Best Thai food in Ithaca. The wait can be a little long sometimes, other than that the service is good.
This is a decent restaurant for thai food but I think it's slight over priced. I've been here a bunch of times and usually order the pad thai. One time I ordered the pad see ew but it was really different than what I'm used to eating in Chicago (it sucked) so I never ordered that again. I've come here with large groups and they are pretty fast with everyone's order so that's a definite plus to this restaurant. There's a ton of thai restaurants in Ithaca and I'd say try Sticky Rice.
There's nothing quite like sitting down and having a family-style thai dinner with share plates and a big pot of rice. A bunch of friends and I ordered gaeng masaman,  thai spicy noodles, pad thai, spicy eggplant, and a shrimp dish. All of them were incredible, but the curry stood out as our favorite. It was just such a perfect blend of sweet and savory and pure deliciousness. I still have dreams about that curry. We had five people in our group, including a dude friend with a massive appetite. Five dishes were absolutely fitting and although we scraped every single main plate clean, we left feeling nicely full but not overstuffed. The only issue I have with this place is the service. Our waitress was nowhere to be seen after taking our order without a pen/paper, showing up only as we were walking out the door. We had several different staff members deliver our food, drop off the check, and brusquely bus our table. We literally sat there awkwardly staring at each other as a random server loudly (and rudely) stacked our tableware into a rickety tower and whisked away to the kitchen without acknowledgement towards us. Talk about lack of customer service. Nevertheless, the food was amazing and you can't overlook that simple fact. Taste of Thai not only reignited my passion for thai food, but also patched up my bad experiences with previous places as well.
Absolutely delicious thai food. I ordered green curry with chicken last week, and it was probably the best thai curry I've ever had. The ambience is lacking; it's not very aesthetically pleasing and appears a little grungy/old (which is the only reason I've given this a 4 and not a 5), but don't let the appearance fool you! The food far and away makes the mediocre atmosphere worth it. Besides, you're going for thai food for the FOOD, not the atmosphere, right? Servers were nice, brought water and rice promptly for us spice-wimps. Very reasonably priced. Just a straightforward win when you're looking for purely tasty, satisfying thai food. Can't wait to go back and try something else.
Our group of 20 or so seemed to overwhelm the restaurant, but they did an adequate job of getting our food to us.   I had the Spicy Rad Nah Noodles, spice level 3 (out of 5), which was plenty spicy for me!  Others in our party dared to have level 4, which was probably the upper limit on spiciness able to be supported by a bunch of weak Americans.
This restaurant is almost completely empty at the start of the lunch hour, and then packed by the end - though the wait is never longer than a few minutes.  The food is tasty and quick, and the service is just right - they're attentive without being annoying. I've had the pad thai, and another dish involving those giant thick noodles.  The giant thick noodles were perfectly cooked and the spice was just right.  It's definitely the kind of place where you can go to lunch and not wind up in a food coma for the rest of the afternoon - portions are reasonable, as are the prices.

Spectacular Thai food that lives up to the best Thai restaurants in NYC! I admit it - living in NYC has spoiled me rotten when it comes to ethnic food.  I love Thai food, but have become quite choosy about what I consider good, authentic Thai because let's face it, there are at least a thousand Thai restaurants in NYC.  Taste Of Thai did more than just live up to my favorite Thai restaurants in NYC; it really wowed me! My boyfriend and I had dinner here one night this past July when we were up in Ithaca for a week long vacation in the Finger Lakes region.  He had eaten here the last time he had come up to Ithaca and he raved about it, so I wanted to give this place a try. We started off with the Goong Sarong (prawns dressed in egg noodles golden fried served with a sweet chili dipping sauce) for an appetizer.  Definitely one of THE best and unique Thai dishes I've ever eaten!  For dinner, I had the Gaeng Kiew Pad Hang (dried emerald curry) with chicken, which was amazing.  It was flavorful and had a nice bite to it.  My boyfriend had the Thai Spicy Noodles, which he loved as well. The serivce was really good here as well.  Our server was pleasant and very attentive.  This was the cheapest meal we had all week while we were staying up here and overall, one of the best for the money.  I know I'll be coming back here the next time I am up in Ithaca!

Excellent pad thai. Definitely get the Thai iced tea. In the world of Thai food, this place is good for the price but quite not the top of the line with food quality. You won't go wrong with it though.
The BEST Thai food I've had any place anywhere and I've been around. Totally fresh and delicious. A must have.

A very famous Asian restaurant in Ithaca and really crowded on Friday night. I've been there a couple times and love all the curries. The appetizers, spring rolls, and soup are all pretty good. Simply a nice place to have a joyful dinner with friends. A bit noisy inside, which also makes the place feel more free and casual to chat with close friends.
