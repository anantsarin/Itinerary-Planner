I ate here over the weekend while I was in town for a graduation.   The atmosphere is great and the service was very friendly.   I ordered the roasted red pepper and basil hummus and a wedge salad.  The hummus was lovely (and people who would compare FRESH hummus to Sabra's or Trader Joe's?  Seriously...)- it was just the right touch of spicy and the pita was toasty but not crunchy.  Delicious!  I don't understand serving it with olive oil AND balsamic... Olive oil?  sure- typical middle eastern fare.  But balsamic?  No need.   The wedge was well sized for the price.  Usually wedge salads come under dressed but this one had plenty of dressing and was yummy. The rest of our table got everything from onion soup to one of the many choices of eggs benedict to chicken Caesar and a bbq brisket sandwich.  Every eggs benedict eater cleaned their plates and I was able to try the CRAZY scrumptious hash brown casserole.  Oh. My. Goodness.  So good!  Everyone loved their food.   I *did* also have a Bloody Mary that could have used a little less horseradish... the heat was good but the flavor was a bit strong.   Otherwise?  I would totally go back if I ever found myself in Ithaca again.
In town for a meeting and looking for a place withing walking distance of the hotel, I decided to give the Mahogany Grill a try.  It was a winner for several reasons. First of all, they offer outdoor dining as an option.  Given that a New York winter is always on the horizon this time of the year, it is good to take those opportunities to eat outside. The corn chowder had a decent amount of spiciness and a good kick, but not so hot that you could not enjoy the flavor. The crab cake sandwich was a tasty piece of meat on good bread. And my colleague's grilled chicken salad also was quite fresh looking with several good looking pieces of chicken to supplement the salad. Not sure when I will be back in Ithace but would come here again.
Came here on a Saturday night (right before my graduation) with a very large party and no reservation. I had gone to several restaurants nearby (Viva, Mercato, etc) and couldn't find a table for us, but the people at Mahogany told me to wait 10 minutes, and they got us a table! My dad (who's never met a stranger) started talking to the manager, who sent us a bottle of champagne (brut), which the waiter poured for each person and then left the rest for me in a bucket! I had the red pepper hummus which was good but not as good as Sabra or Trader Joe's. The chicken wings were amazing! Amazing! I had a steak, I can't remember which one. It was ok, but over cooked. I wanted medium rare, but it was more medium-medium well. It was also very charred on the outside. The side of macaroni and cheese was great though. I had several drinks, a strawberry based mixed drink which was good. My Hennessey and coke was very strong (yay!). If I'd known it was so good, I'd have gone while I was in school! I definitely recommend it.
The Thai wings are fabulous, as well as the calamari. Totally enjoyed my experience and got to enjoy the outdoor service in the nice fall weather. Waiters are knowledgable about the menu and very friendly. Would visit again next time in Ithaca.
We stopped in with kids after hiking at Treman State Park.  Food was great and staff was friendly.  Good beer and wine selection.  Ithaca is great!
We were in Ithaca for Cornell, and while walking the Main Street stumbled upon this place. Their wine was suggested by the server and it was out of this world... we are to this day trying to find anything similar. For the meal we had gotten a round of burgers and the Kobe burger on toasted Brioche.... Wow! It was amazing. The service was prompt, and the overall experience was very pleasant.
I can only review the bar, where we went for a night cap.  It was fine.  It served it's purpose and the bar tenders were attentive.  However, two things stood out to me.  The first was when a plate of scallops came out to the bar and the smell of bad seafood overwhelmed the whole area.  It was BAD. I seriously hope no one ate them.  I don't think they did.  After that, I went to use the bathroom and realized that the smell coming from the kitchen wasn't any better than the horrible bad scallop smell.  Not a good sign.
Great service, but horrible food. Our waitress was wonderful. She was honest about her thoughts on the menu, which I appreciated. She was quick and attentive to all our needs and she checked in regularly. The brisket and mashed potatoes are pre-cooked and they taste that way. I would avoid that menu item if you aren't a fan of leftovers. My Mahogony burger was nothing special. The beef didn't have much flavor. If my experience was based on service alone, I would return. If you're looking for good food, go to Just a Taste next door.
With lots of options in DTWN Ithaca for lunch we just went with our gut and landed here.  Not disappointed.  15 min wait for table - no problem Server was terrific - attentive but not a pain.   food was great.   Grilled chicken sandwiches cooked to order. and a BBQ beef.  Alternatives to menu options were happily accommodated.   Mac and cheese side was worth the calories.
Food was ridiculously amazing! Some things are pretty expensive for what they are but most are average nice restaurant prices. The waiters were charming and very attentive. We went in a big group for someone's birthday and they handled us very well. Great place :)!
The positives - The burgers offer a reasonable price point on this menu and are quite good. Get the sweet potato fries, well worth the extra charge. The brunch menu is also affordable and reasonably tasty. The service is really spot on here. I ran trivia for a short while, so I know a few of the servers, and in my opinion they are very nice and professional. As for the bar, if you are looking for a cocktail, the Moscow mules are fantastic. The negatives - I think the food at dinner is just not up to standard compared to other "upscale" restaurants in Ithaca. I guess one could call the presentation rustic, but I'd call it sloppy; it has been improving though. I once splurged on the fillet here and for $30 I expected it to be fantastic, seasoned well and cooked to perfection (medium rare in my case), but unfortunately it wasn't either. The insanity - I can't for the life of me understand why the restaurant doesn't fix the taps. The beer comes out with an insane amount of head, so much so that they have to let the glasses overflow for several seconds. They must waste so much beer; frankly its embarrassing and looks totally unprofessional ... unless you happen to be drunk, then it becomes highly amusing. Overall - great service, awful beer taps, decent food, but in my opinion it's over priced.
Great service. Great food (Thai wings, Mac and cheese, Kobe burger, ginger chicken salad). Had a screen and projector to show the football games which was really nice. Great experience.
This review is for the Bacon Vodka Bloody Mary, which my husband had whilst I sipped on a very nice martini that rather paled in comparison to my partner's choice. The Bacon Vodka Bloody Mary completely rocks. It has bacon infused vodka (why didn't I think of that?) and comes with a crispy bacon garnish. Which is quite appalling, really, in a sort of "Let them drink bacon infused vodka..." kind of way. Luckily, I live no where near Ithaca, and thus am in no danger of becoming a drunken Marie Antoinette of Upstate New York, or of catching my husband coming home with bacony-vodka-spicy-tomato deliciousness on his breath.   I highly recommend this beverage, but only for the more shameless of you carnivorous drinkers.
So unimpressed with this place. I've expected good things both times, thinking it was more like its neighbor (Ithaca Ale House)...sadly, it was not. I got a steak and gorgonzola salad the first time, which was okay at best. The second time, I got the Cobb salad at the recommendation of the waitress. It was horrendous. Tasteless, lukewarm (should at least be cold!), just...not good. Normally I'll finish a salad even if it's not very good, cause at least I'm getting in some veggies, but I couldn't even finish this one. So disappointing.
I have had lunch and brunch here. Brunch most recently this Sunday. I ordered oyster eggs benedict: one of the specials. It came with a complimentary mimosa (delicious) and our party of 4 had a good time. The oyster patty was excellent with a crunchy exterior and a soft flavorful interior. I was disappointed with the hollandaise sauce - it was too overdone and wasn't very viscous. The poached egg was also overcooked. The home fries were average at best - they had a nice color but no taste at all especially compared to the rich flavor of the oyster patty. The home-made english muffin was out of this world excellent though - very moist, crisp and perfectly baked. My friend got the steak and eggs, which I thought was delicious - although it is hard to screw up steak and eggs especially if you're a grill. Otherwise, my coffee was delicious and well roasted. The service was pretty average. Our waitress didn't really fill our water glasses, I had to ask three times for milk with my coffee, and she forgot to tell us about the specials. She was very courteous and our orders were exactly right.
Kobe burgers, calamari and atmosphere are excellent.  Service is also very good.  Our server, Jana, was prompt, courteous and knowledgeable.
Sometimes I don't know why this restaurant exists but then I see eager Cornell parents perusing the Commons with their incoming freshmen children and it makes sense.  but I feel no desire to eat there - the food is boring, the seating is crowded, the staff is ambivalent, and the prices too high for what is delivered.   I gave this place one last chance last year because I received a gift certificate, but alas, it just did not deliver on anything memorable.  It's a shame because restaurants on that street get a certain amount of built-in business, and I just don't think they deserve it.
My son and I had dinner here last night.  We chose this restaurant because of the good online reviews.  The hostess was very sweet.  We waited 30 minutes for a table, which is typical for a better restaurant on a Saturday night.  Once seated, we ordered the calamari fritters as an appetizer, which was a little greasy, but good.  My son had a ceasar salad, which was just ok.  I ordered the pecan crusted salmon.  I asked to substitute the fingerling potatoes for sweet potato fries, and was told by the waiter that I could NOT because the orders were already portioned out.... which is the most ridiculous thing I ever heard!  The salmon was just ok.  The fingerling potatoes were way over salted and not eaten.  Overall, I would give this place 2 stars
As Grill/Pubs go, this place is fairly standard. The interior is very pretty with the dark wood and brass. Our lunch was standard Grill/Pub fare. I got the pulled pork (6 out of 10 on my pulled pork scale. Nobody makes it like mom) and my wife got the Pesto Chicken with sweet potato fries (she really liked it). The Mahogany grill might have a different crowd during evenings, judging by Kat H's review, because it felt like a standard "I need a bite to each after sight seeing/shopping in downtown Ithaca" type of crowd. Solid place. I would recommend. I just wouldn't say its amazing.
This bar feels sporty. The vodka tonic and white Russian I consumed were both about the same size as a tall glass of orange juice. Needless to say, it does not take long to get trashed, and you can do it faster and with less cash than at, say, Madeline's.
if i had to describe the food in one word, it would be salty. I came here for lunch during Restaurant Week and ordered the lobster bisque, which was tasty but overly salty-- to the point where I had to slow down sipping it, and the New York Reuben, with a generous portion of salty corned beef, heap of sauerkraut, and small but sufficient amount of Russian dressing on a toasted marble rye, and sweet potato fries on the side.  The thick sweet potato fries were amazing though, definitely the best part of the meal.  All this for $10 off the prix fixe menu only available during restaurant week (otherwise the bisque would be $8, and the sandwich with fries $11).  The portions were moderately large, but the bisque is heavy and will fill you up right away. I must say I wouldn't order the bisque again, especially if it's $8. Besides the mediocre food, the restaurant itself was very homey but nicely decorated with books and old pictures.  The atmosphere makes for a good business/casual lunch or dinner place.
The prices are reasonable for their appetizers and salads but the food is super salty. Although the staff was friendly, the service was pretty inconsistent. They brought out our entrees before the appetizers. They filled our water only when we sat down and we never got bread for our table. Needless to say, I was disappointed.
I liked the steak and eggs served for brunch. The steak was well cooked and seasoned nicely. Scrambled eggs were a touch overcooked for my liking, but in my experience that's pretty standard in the USA. The place also keeps the brunch menu going fairly late on Sundays (I ate there around 3pm). Service was efficient. I don't know why the place wasn't busier. Only real downside was the lack of espresso. This is an issue for me.
Tuna steak was awful: tough, stringy, and doused with oregano! When mentioned to the waiter, he says "Sorry" and drops the check, without any sort of follow-up. Med-rare burger was completely charred on the outside, and completely raw inside, with soggy onion rings to boot. Plus, patrons seated next to us loudly dropped f-bombs throughout dinner. Not a pleasant dining experience, with prices that should have assured it was!!
Enjoyed mussels and marinated skirt steak. Generally happy with the food, but a little pricey. Also, I wish the restaurant is a bit brighter. Not a big fan of restaurants with little lights.
Only a bar review here. Bartenders mix very well. Quick service also. Pricing is moderate. Expected it to be cramped on a Friday night but there was some room to breathe. Nice scotch menu. Overall was quite pleased.
I've been to the Mahogany Grill twice. Both times I had an amazing burger. Try their ranch sauce with their fries...it's different than other places. On my second visit, I order the lobster bisque. You should avoid that. Can't beat the burgers.
I went here on a date once. The food is nothing special in my opinion and way too overpriced for what you get. I had a sweet tooth that day and I found that the dessert selection is very poor and quite limited. I hardly remember what I ordered, which speaks to the quality of the restaurant. I do remember, however, constantly swatting flies and being seated by the busy kitchen. The butter for the bread is pretty good, sort of apple flavored, but I wasn't too impressed. Come to think of it, I believe I ordered crab cakes and my date ordered steak and mashed potatoes...I found neither to be special but his dish was better than mine, which I suppose makes it mediocre. To make matters worse, when we got home we got sick! I couldn't go out that night and he spent the night going back and forth to the bathroom. I will take back what I said earlier; Mahogany Grill did provide me with a memorable experience--food poisoning! I'd heard good things about this restaurant but I was very disappointed. My experience at Mahogany Grill definitely put a bad taste in my mouth and I will not be returning...EVER!
I usually go for the Tuesday trivia, and they have drink specials and 1/2-price appetizers. The place is packed for trivia and I usually get an appetizer. The Kizammy Tuna is delicious and the pot stickers are definitely above average; the "bbq pork wings" weren't bad but I'll probably get something else in the future.
The location is great, the decor appropriately collegiate, but the food... I went with my boyfriend and his parents.  His parents had salads and seemed pleased with them.  My boyfriend ordered a wild mushroom burger, medium rare, with sweet potato fries.  It came medium well and with no mushrooms whatsoever.  The server took the burger back but left the fries on the otherwise empty plate on the table to be eaten (that seemed weird.  put them on a fresh plate.)  The new burger took so long to come that the rest of us were done by the time it arrived.  And wild mushrooms?  Looked like crimini mushrooms to me.  But it was cooked right. I ordered the "Waitress" - a chicken salad sandwich with cranberries.  Yum!  Or so I thought.  It was basically flavorless.  I'm a huge fan of chicken salad with cranberries and it doesn't take a lot to make me happy.  This sandwich made me unhappy.  The sweet potato fries were fine.   I'll probably go back but order something that someone else has recommended here.
Food was usual pub food had the blt special and it was ok not fabulous.  Sat outside and the service was fast and friendly.
Service is good, but the meals leave much to be desired. I recently went back to the Mahogany Grill to try it again (the first time, last year, was average) and to order something new. The spinach and artichoke dip was good, but all restaurants serve this appetizer, and it's hard to mess up. I ordered a shrimp scampi dish and was greeted by three, rubbery shrimp atop a bed of flavorless pasta. I couldn't even finish my meal because the shrimp was too rubbery. I tried to feign interest in the dish since I was being treated to dinner by a school administrator. Overall, the dinner did not agree with me and made me sick to my stomach after an hour. I do not see myself returning to Mahogany Grill when there are many better options in Ithaca.
this place is great. just great. staffs were friendly, service was fast, food was yummy and price was reasonable. we had lobster bisque, wedge salad, filet stuffed with lobster and scallops on flat bread. everything was so delicious and we ended up too full to order a dessert.
Complaints are that the place is on the expensive side. Yes, it is, but I'd argue the food you get is well worth it. Their steaks are very good, and service is great as well. Personally, I think the Boatyard Grill's ambiance is better, but you can't go wrong at either place.
I LOVE Mahogany.  I think this is one of the underrated places in Ithaca.  Their food is delicious and their seasonal raviolis are to die for.  The prices are a bit high, but so worth it for the value of the food you get, and I love the sweet butter they serve with the bread.  Plus it's right on the Commons so it's a great place to stop if you're walking around Downtown.
I had a good steak here once.  It's pretty pricey for Ithaca but what are you gonna do?  Your choices are few.  Can't you see you're stuck?!  You're trapped in this tiny ass town!!  GET OUT!!! GET OUT NOW!!!
Don't miss this eatery.  Great food, excellent service.  Interesting menu, nothing too exotic, but out of the ordinary.  One of the few places that serves filet oscar ( My favorite)  Gorgeous interior; real mahogany paneling, beveled leaded glass windows,  tin ceilings.  On the commons, and right around the corner from the art house theater, Cinemopolis.   Perfect for dinner and a movie.
We were visiting Cornell this past weekend and happen to come upon the Mahogany Grill when our attempts to get in at Simeon's and Mercato fell through.  Despite the previous yelp reviews, we decided to take a chance, as we were starving. From start to finish, we were pleasantly surprised by the food.... Hot, crispy loaves of bread served with butter and an amazing garlicky tomato sauce on the side, followed by a pan seared mahi that was both fresh and moist. My wife and kids all had the Kobe burgers, which they said was great.  Drinks were tasty and generously sized. All in all a wonderful meal!
Kind of a let down. I was expecting more and had been told it was great. The food was just ok. I hate going out and feeling like I could have made the same meal but better and that's exactly how I felt here. Service was good but not exemplary
My wife and I visited Ithaca for the first time.  We walked around downtown looking for a nice restaurant.  Mahogany Grill caught our eye with how nice it looked with all the old wood work.  I made reservations and they were right on-time with seating us.  However, it took longer than an acceptable amount of time to be initially acknowledged by our server.  Once I brought the issue to the manager's attention, the issue was taken care of.  The server apologized for the wait and went above and beyond to make up for the error.   The food we ordered tasted very good.  The presentation could have been a little fancier given the price of the food.   Overall, I will be going back upon my return to Ithaca
Great black angus burger!
Loved the warm cheesy bread rolls- best part of the night. My oven roasted half chicken was lacking in flavor, but the black cherry currant port reduction was delicious. More sauce drizzled over the chicken might've helped with the flavor. Cheesecake was okay- too dense and somewhat bland.
The building itself has changed much over the years...It's got that Cheers feel to it. It went through a renovation when the new owners took over but much of the inside decor didn't change. In the summer time it's great because the windows are removed and you have a nice little sidewalk patio area to eat in or in the main dining area. Half the bar is a restaurant, or if you want to just go in for a drink, the other half is reserved for bar patrons. But you can also eat at the bar. I have sent soooooooo many people to this place, I should be considered a part owner. I love their filet mignon. I love steak, and these guys do steak right! Excellent flavors, the sweet potato fries are an excellent choice for the side dish. It's just a great place to eat that is pretty classy for downtown Ithaca. It's a real jewel and one of the best places for steak in Ithaca. I think it was even better than John Thomas which prides itself on aged-beef.
Mahogany Grill is your typical American grill / pub style restaurant where the food is decent and the service is good.   My boyfriend and I selected this place for dinner on our first night in Ithaca during a week long vacation up in the Finger Lakes this past July.  The atmosphere was nice - it was a beautiful night out, so we decided to eat outdoors in the sidewalk cafe area.  We ordered a nice bottle of local wine to start (a Glenora Vineyards cabernet franc), which was a nice, solid bottle of red at a reasonable price.  We started off with the zucchini stack, which was flavorful and crispy.  We also chose one of the special apps; the "dank and unruly" wings.  With a name like that, we were expecting super spicy wings covered in a dark sauce, popping with flavor.  What we got was some chicken wings covered in a very light, citrus honey sauce.  They should have been called "Summer Wings" instead because they were neither dank nor unruly!  When we gave our honest feedback to the waiter, he seemed surprised that they were not what we were expecting and unemphatically agreed to bring us more sauce to see if that would help boost the flavor (most unfortunately, it did not).   For the main course, I had the cast iron seared Jail Island salmon (with mashed potatoes and asparagus), which was delicious.  My boyfriend had the filet medallions Oscar (with mashed potatoes and creamed corn), which he really enjoyed as well.   Overall, we really did enjoy our experience here.  The service is reliable, but not great.  The food is very good, but a bit overpriced for a grill style restaurant in Ithaca.
My 6 friends and I visited here when we were in town for a wedding.  We arrived, put our name on the list, and went into the bar side of the place.  Drinks were good.  Of course its hard to mess up a Makers and Coke.  After about two drinks each, we were seated.  I ordered the 30oz+ T-bone steak, medium, with mashed potatoes and corn chowder, and a salad with strawberry vinaigrette.  Salad was good, strawberry viniagrette isn't really my first choice, but I don't recall them having ranch. But whatever.  Ok, steak came.  WOO HOO a big piece of steak.  Alright, lets slice my first piece.  Hmmm... ok, needs a little salt.  I add some salt and try again.  Hmmmm.  Keep eating...  Hmmm... Something's funny here.  The steak had no taste!!!  All I could taste WAS the salt, and the char from the cooking!  WTF?!  Ok ok, I ate the steak, bc its a steak after all.  I mean, it didn't taste bad, just didn't taste like anything.  Actually, right at the end, right next to the bone, there was flavor, but not enough for the entire piece of meat.  Fortunately their saving grace was the seasoned mashed potatoes and the corn chowder.  They made up for the lack of flavor with the steak.  Each was very good.  Like, yeah, hella good even.  Really good.  Def get those.  Anyway, I think my friends enjoyed their food, and I'll just have to try a different steak there if I ever make it back to Ithaca, either the strip steak or the ribeye.  I believe in second chances.  But I also believe in flavor--in steaks, not just tasty mashed potatoes and corn chowder.  But I also believe in second chances.
I love this place. Food was excellent. Atmosphere, excellent. Service, excellent. We had the dry rubbed salmon with kale and beans.....and the cavitapi with pesto...mmmmmmm! Highly recommended!!!!
As another reviewer said, the only reason they can get away with these prices is the location.  The location and the decor is excellent.  No issues with the service, either.  As for the food... well, let's just say that most of the salt in their kitchen found its way in our lobster bisque and nothing else.  We couldn't even finish the bisque, it was so salty.  My steak and potatoes had less seasoning than I might have desired, and the vegetables were a little undercooked.  My wife's sirloin burger was what one would expect from such a simple dish.  (I should note, with the exception of some of the appetizers, most of the menu was rather uninspired.)  On a positive note, the bread tomato-garlic sauce was an interesting twist on the complimentary appetizer, and the highlight of the meal may have been the sweet potato fries.  Nevertheless, given the price, I will have to pass on Mahagony Grill next time.
I went here to eat the weekend I got engaged, and it was the perfect location to go. The interior practically glows with all the shiny mahogany and brass fixtures; it's beautiful, old, and warm. It's divided into an area with a bar and then a dining room area by a red curtain, keeping the two crowds apart. The food was up there in price (probably upwards of 25$ per plate) but was so worth it. The salad dressing was delicate, the meat cooked perfectly, and the vegetables wondrously seasoned. They have a wide variety of choices on the menu too, unlike many formal restaurants, so no one is left wondering what to order.
Mahogany offers everything from brunch to dinner and has different specials everyday. They offer indoor and out door seating, they are always very clean, They keep the lights on a low setting so it is relaxing and romantic. They can be pricey if you are ordering drinks. I recommend this restaurant to college students families or friends that are having a night on the town. I would definitely say try there burgers and there calamari.
Great pub style restaurant with nice decor.  Awesome burgers....I mean awesome! We were eating like pigs in a trough at the food we ordered.  Awesome and tasty pub fare.  Definitely would go back.
Bad service, but great food!
Nice lighting and attentive service make up for a rather ho hum menu.  I had the chicken potstickers, expecting they would be lightly - not deep - fried.  My steak salad was huge but the cut of meat was not very good.  Good sweet potato fries though,and my H liked his burger.  Then again how hard is it to make a decent burger?  The "tall" chocolate cake for two was served warm and very moist.
I had the filet of beef with the fried chicken dumplings and was extremely satisfied with my food. I ordered the beef medium well and it was cooked perfectly, very juicy on the inside without being overly done. The dumplings were also delicious! My friends ordered the salmon and they too were happy with their order. Our waitress was courteous, prompt, and more than happy to answer our questions. She checked on us every so often to ask if the meal was all right and to refill our drinks. We enjoyed our dinner at this restaurant and it was a great way to end a trip to Ithaca.
They sat us outside and got us water, then forgot about us for 20 minutes.  We got up and left.
The prices are reasonable for their appetizers and salads but the food is super salty. Although the staff was friendly, the service was pretty inconsistent. They brought out our entrees before the appetizers. They filled our water only when we sat down and we never got bread for our table. Needless to say, I was disappointed.

Something's funny here.  The steak had no taste!!!  All I could taste WAS the salt, and the char from the cooking!  WTF?!  Ok ok, I ate the steak, bc its a steak after all.  I mean, it didn't taste bad, just didn't taste like anything.  Actually, right at the end, right next to the bone, there was flavor, but not enough for the entire piece of meat.  Fortunately their saving grace was the seasoned mashed potatoes and the corn chowder.  They made up for the lack of flavor with the steak.  Each was very good.  Like, yeah, hella good even.  Really good.  Def get those.  Anyway, I think my friends enjoyed their food, and I'll just have to try a different steak there if I ever make it back to Ithaca, either the strip steak or the ribeye.  I believe in second chances.  But I also believe in flavor--in steaks, not just tasty mashed potatoes and corn chowder.  But I also believe in second chances.
As another reviewer said, the only reason they can get away with these prices is the location.  The location and the decor is excellent.  No issues with the service, either.  As for the food... well, let's just say that most of the salt in their kitchen found its way in our lobster bisque and nothing else.  We couldn't even finish the bisque, it was so salty.  My steak and potatoes had less seasoning than I might have desired, and the vegetables were a little undercooked.  My wife's sirloin burger was what one would expect from such a simple dish.  (I should note, with the exception of some of the appetizers, most of the menu was rather uninspired.)  On a positive note, the bread tomato-garlic sauce was an interesting twist on the complimentary appetizer, and the highlight of the meal may have been the sweet potato fries.  Nevertheless, given the price, I will have to pass on Mahagony Grill next time.
