Pi craft is a locally owned place in a sea of restaurant chains. It's fast too-- each time I've been there it's taken six to eight minutes to get my pizza hot from the oven. I like the create-your-own option at Pi. It's reminiscent of chipotle in that it's made right in front of you, the way you like it, using fresh ingredients. Unlike Crust on Allen st. in Buffalo, which has a similar concept, you can add as many toppings as you like for a set price. Pi has a gluten free crust option! I tried a pepperoni pizza, and the hand cut pepperoni was really good. Not too spicy. While the shredded mozzarella gives the pizza a nice melted covering, I recommend adding the fresh mozzarella as well because it added nice flavor and texture. I had this with the herb red sauce, which was okay, but I think if go with the plain tomato next time. I tried the oil and cream base with four cheeses, caramelized onions, mushrooms, and arugula and balsamic afters. The pizza was a little too oily, so it was kind of soupy in the middle. The Balsamic drizzle and arugula were really great. I think it needed more garlic and less cheese. Good service and nice, casual atmosphere.
Their gluten free pizza is not gluten free.  Sliced with the same cutter as every other pizza (Oh, and although I previously suggested that they use a different tub of sauce for gluten free pizzas, since they touch the ladle all over the crust and dip it back in the sauce repeatedly, they just grab a different ladle for you and use the contaminated sauce).   The toppings are also cross contaminated, too, since they are reaching in the bins after handling the crust.  I've been there twice and got (Celiac) sick each time- not coming back again.  Don't bother offering a gluten free crust if you won't take basic precautions to avoid cross-contact, even when your customers suggest easy changes!
I am from Long Island, so my favorite kind of pizza is New York style with thin crust. I've avoided eating pizza in Buffalo because I never seem to like any place I've tried. Pi Craft has the best crust in Buffalo as well as the best pizza. I ordered the chipotle pizza which comes with the standard dough, bbq sauce, mozzarella cheese topped with chicken, caramelized onions, mushrooms, and banana peppers. I topped it off with their bbq sauce after bake and the pizza was fantastic. It was crispy and every bite was packed with flavor and toppings. My boyfriend custom ordered his pizza with the standard dough. He added red sauce  with mozzarella cheese and topped that with banana peppers, mushrooms, onions, spinach and turkey sausage. His was also fantastic. The toppings were plentiful and the red sauce was savory and provided a lot of flavor. I also appreciate the fact that they provide healthy options for pizza with gluten free and multigrain crust. They substitute things like regular sausage for turkey sausage to make it just a little bit better for you. I will be coming back more often.
Excellent pizza fast. So many toppings to choose from. They have suggested pizzas but I created my own. Meatball banana pepp and ricotta cheese. So good. Owner is friendly. Recommended bringing kids in Sunday since they would get a free pizza for each pizza I ordered. Right off 290 exit, a lot more parking in back if front lot is full.
I've been meaning to try this place for a while and Local Restaurant Week was the time to make the leap. The service is alright. My husband and I showed up at 8 on a Monday night (the place closes at 9) so maybe it was just a little too late in the evening for everyone behind the counter to be welcoming. Pi Craft is laid out like Chipotle or Subway, however you can also order pizzas and focaccia-wiches that are house specialties, which is exactly what we did. I got the Veggie Focaccia-wich and my husband when with the Ham Jam Focaccia-wich. Since it was LRW Hot Dessert Sticks and Johnnie Ryan fountain drinks came with our sandwiches. I will say, everything was really good, probably my husband's Ham Jam Focaccia-wich more so than my Veggie Focaccia-wich, but it still wasn't bad at all. And the pizza dough that the Hot Dessert Sticks were made out of were out of this world!  If nothing else, I'll be back to try the veggie pizza. That dough, man, it was great!   You can read more about what I have to say about the food at my blog, vegetarianbuffalo.com/pi…. So while PI Craft might not be my new favorite place for lunch or dinner, it definitely serves up a tasty meal and I'll most likely be back!
Pi Craft has become my default stop for a Friday pizza fix, especially if I'm going to hit a movie at the AMC on Maple. It has been compared to Chipotle for the ordering style and speed and just like I wouldn't review Chipotle against a real Mexican restaurant, I wouldn't compare Pi Craft to a regular sit-down pizza joint. That said, for what it offers Pi Craft is top notch. For a set price you can choose as many ingredients as you like to go on your choice of regular or gluten free crust. I typically go for a standard crust with olive oil & garlic (actual real garlic gets schmeared on, which is amazing) topped with mushrooms, spinach, and sometimes banana peppers. I've also tried the original cheese with tomato herb sauce and I'm a fan. After assembling your pizza they throw it on a conveyor belt through the oven, and by the time you figure out what you want to drink and pay the pizza is ready. They have some after-drizzles (pretty sure that isn't the real name) and I'm partial to the balsamic because it's amazing. The pizza is solid, and considering the claim that everything on the menu is under 700 calories, almost too good to be true. (Seriously HOW is everything under 700 calories? Does not compute). Overall, I'm definitely a fan.
Pi craft is a cute addition to the area.  The food tastes great, all the ingredients are very fresh.  They offer Johhny Ryan fountain soda which is awesome!  I'm a pretty plain person when it comes to pizza so I just got the basic cheese pizza, but it tasted so good. I could taste all of the garlic and spices and the sauce has a really nice flavor. The atmosphere in the restaurant is cool, it doens't seem like a brand new place. The owner came over and talked to me about the business and how he's very exciting and expansion plans are in the works! He also let me know that they do a special with White Rabbit next door, if you buy the apple dessert from Pi Craft you can get a scoop of vanilla frozen yogurt to top it of for free!
The pizza was very delicious and interesting. Atmosphere is gorgeous. Very good quick run in pizza spot. Pizza is made quickly and freshly. Cons: I feel as though they're a bit stingy with topics. I would've loved more cheese and more sauce. I feel like it would give it a better pop to the flavor. Overall: great place, would highly recommend to friends. BUT coming from NYC I have a high standard of pizza and hope the owner sees this post and becomes a bit more generous with the topics. Speaking of owners, he is very nice as is all his staff. Was greeted with a warm smile and laughter. Definitely coming back.
My all time favorite spot for pizza!!! Ingredients are all fresh and service is excellent!!!
Disgusting! Nothing about this place was fresh. It's like going to a day old salad bar then they throw it on crust or in a plastic salad bowl. I even witnessed the manager climb under the pizza conveyor, pickup the pepper grinder from the floor come out and crack pepper on a customers pizza. And he never changed his gloves after. My salad was wilted and brown and the arugula I had added to my pizza smelled like it was rotten. What a disgrace to Buffalo
I'm surprised to see all of the mixed reviews on Yelp because I thought this place was fantastic. I came here with my in-laws for a graduation celebration.  We all very much enjoyed our food. We started with the grilled and fried calamari.  Our table was split as to which we liked better but I think both were equally good. The restaurant has specials that they change out every week. I ordered a special of thick noodles, shrimp, and saffron brandy cream sauce.  I like how fresh the egg noodles tasted. I thought it was great. I think the sauce could have had a bit more flavoring but the shrimp and pasta were cooked perfectly. My husband had a meat ravioli and devoured his meal as did most everyone at the table. The service was excellent.  The waiter was very friendly and brought a cake for the graduation celebrants. I would definitely return!
I'm not that much of a pizza fan generally, but this was very good.  The half for $5 perfect for lunch, filling but not enough to leave you falling into a food coma at your desk an hour later.  They have interesting toppings and you get as mo Any as you want for the same price.  Service was quick and friendly too.  I totally appreciated that they have Johnnie Ryan's instead of Coke or Pepsi.  I think that's a bold move!  Way to go local!   The decor is also clean and comfortable.  My only complaint would be the fan.  I understand that their employees are probably cooking at a 700 degree oven, but where I was sitting it was super cold and our napkins kept blowing off the table. It was really annoying, so watch where you sit.
Ordered Mexican and Chipotle Pie. And 2 Waters (Cup). Summary: Very friendly, good food, fast. Each pizza is about a 10-11 inch, I'm not so good at estimating. It was enough for two small eaters to make a full meal, and you'd be a medium-heavy eater to eat it alone. It is like a small-medium size pizza from a chain place. Mexican was way better than the Chipotle. They offered sauce drizzled on the chipotle, and after they persuaded me a bit I reluctantly agreed. I wish I hadn't. The pizza was still very good, but with light chicken (thin sliced and not in great quantity) the sauce was just more than it should have been. The Mexican was well balanced and flavored in all ways. It has nice pulled chucks of pork, corn, jalapenos, very thin onions, thin green peppers, and maybe something else. Not too much of anything and plenty of meat. This pizza is what kept the place at a 5 star rating. Very spacious, quality, and clean bathrooms. Individual bathrooms (one person at a time), but this isn't a large store so it is fine. They make the pizza while you watch, and you can even build your own as they go through the topping process. Crust was fluffy and delicious! $8.50 per custom/specialty Pizza.
Could actually be the best pizza in buffalo.  I really like the "Chipotle" set up where they build your pie and top it with whatever high quality fresh ingredients you want. Priced right too, if I remember correctly you can eat for less than $10 a person, including Johnny Ryan soda which is an awesome touch. First time I went it was kind of dead, so I got a interesting little lesson on the oven and a bit about how and where they started from the manager (owner?).
A new pizza place in buffalo shocker. But this place has  put a new spin on it. The crusts are pre baked and you pizza is made to order within about 3 to 5 min. They have every topping you could think of and then some,  even some stuff you can add on after the baking of the pie. It is recommend to eat the pizza there because the crust in the middle is a little thin and gets soggy if you take it home. Im looking forward to coming back and trying one of those steak sandwiches 2 months latter So it took longer than I thought to get back and try the steak sandwich.  This was one of the best steak sandwiches ive ever had. The steak is well cooked and very tender and they put a good portion of it on there. The bread was soft and the cheese and sauces were delish all melted together.  All and all im impressed with this place and I will be back again and again
Just discovered this place!  Boy, what a delicious pizza. I'm so freakin' excited.  Finally some killer, quick, thin crust, create your own, scrumptious "pi" in Buffalo.  Can't wait to return.  The manager was extremely cool too.
Finally the Chipotle of pizza is here and it's absolutely awesome ! Unlimited meat and unlimited toppings for just $8.50!! Beware though,  adding too many toppings will just  weigh the pizza down due to the thin crust. It's the one place where hogging a full pizza still feels healthy! Overall a great place with great food and courteous staff! !
I love being able to improve my ratings for restaurants over time and this place totally deserves the upgrade.  I have been here about fives times and each experience has surpassed the last.  The staff is really friendly and patient.  If you're lucky enough to come in while the manager/owner is there he will greet you with an enthusiastic hello and guide you through the pizza making process.  Their house made pesto is the way to go, although friends of mine have tried the red sauce and say it's superb as well. They haven't officially named a pizza after me (ha, ha) but if they did it would consist of multi grain crust, pesto sauce, mozzarella, spinach, roasted red peppers, caramelized onions, tomatoes, grilled chicken topped with the herb basil after bake. Alright enough with the watering mouths, I know, it sounds fabulous and IT IS. Everything is so fresh and has such flavor.   If you are a big fan of cheese then definitely go with the mozzarella AND the fresh mozzarella curds.  It's the perfect combination and the manager describes the duo as tasting like a mozzarella stick, only without all the artery clogging fried junk. (Yes, cheese is okay for you sometimes, google it.) This place really has healthy options for every kind of dieter.  I will admit, the gluten free crust isn't my favorite, only because the consistency is slightly different than that of the multi grain.  With the gluten free crust you're getting more of a soft crust instead of that crunch.  The more toppings you add the more it weighs your slice down so when you pick it up it sort of flops but adding more ingredients does nothing to the cost or the taste so I say pile em on!  I hope this place continues to thrive because it is definitely reasonably priced and a perfect treat when you feel like being bad but also good at the same time.  Nothing wrong with a pizza splurge every once in a while!
Here you go Amherst, your own pizza joint right out of Seinfeld episode from the 1990s. Setting the cucumber topping argument beside this restaurant is one of those things that I'm just not sure about. It's a great concept but the experience leaves me just wanting a little bit more when I walk away. Pizzas prepared in under 10 minutes and you can choose to sit in or take-out. Don't get me wrong from the start the food is alright you can create your own pizza or choose from several other options that are preset. I've only been in three times but each time I've somewhat enjoyed the experience but wished that take it up a notch. Maybe they could add options for local craft beers, or possibly have some toppings that are unique or artisan. This is just one of those places that would be helpful to see it kick it up a notch to be successful in this area. For me it's not bad food it's just not a stellar experience, placing it at a more enjoyable fast food option for the area.
It was so good that my family brought home a pie for me. They use fresh ingredients, wonderful sauces, and amazing crust. Hell they have a mission statement (see below). I want to eat this everyday. Pi Craft's mission is to bring healthy, good conscious, real food: pizza, focaccia sandwiches, and chopped salads, to our guests.
Excellent crust and choice of toppings. A serve yourself joint so it has a fast food atmosphere.
I got the triple meat pizza - the pizza had substantially less flavor than I anticipated. The sauce tasted like pure tomato with no spices whatsoever. The parbaked crust was also quite average. My partner made a custom pizza with several veggies and commented that they didn't seem as fresh as they are billed to be. Service was quick, and the atmosphere was nice, but we probably won't return.
This is hands down, the best pizza I have had in Buffalo. I regret that it took me so long to find this place. My boyfriend and I came here for lunch and made our own pizza. Ingredients are fresh and picked exclusively by.... you! We had the pesto sauce with meatballs, braised pork, mozzarella, ricotta, spinach, and tomatoes. It's unlimited toppings for creating your own pie (which I love). A pie that fed us both was $10. Most people got their own pies but we didnt want to be stuffed so one pie was just right for us to share. The guy put the toppings on quickly but not without care. They mean it when they say your pizza will be done in 3 minutes. We topped off the pizza with balsamic drizzle (a definite must) and EVOO. I have never tasted a pizza that so fresh in Buffalo. The crust is thin (just the way I like it) and the toppings were hot and toasty. Their drink varities included soda on tap, honest teas, and lemonades in bottles. I do wish there was more variety for the drinks but I like that they had organic teas to choose from. As we sat down to eat our pizza, the manager (assuming it is) came around asking how everyone's pizza is. Now there's someone who cares about his business. They also have a jar to place your business card in for a chance to win free pizza! And they have a punch card for their pies so after a certain number of purchases,  you get a free pizza! I will definitely be back before I leave Buffalo.
What a wonderful concept! This is our second time here and we could not be happier. Atmosphere is open and surprisingly homey. Food is to die for and employees are quite friendly. Both times I happened to order a similar pizza but they were both phenomenal. All your ingredients are laid out right in front of you an workers are not afraid to make suggestions to help add to the flavor of your food. I chose to get a meat pizza both times. Both the pepperoni and the meatballs are amazing, and the meatballs are made in house! The girlfriend got a cheese pizza the first time and a veggie the second, the veggie was definitely more loved. Overall a great experience and would return in the future for sure! Oh did I mention Johnny Ryan on tap?!

A few things: 1. Look at the menu ahead of time and think about what you might want; 2. The parking lot isn't bad really. Don't let that be the deciding factor of coming here; 3. All meals here are under 700 calories! Not shabby at all!; 4. Unlimited toppings; 5. Overpriced beverages (but they do have Johnny Ryan's on the fountain, including grape and cherry flavors); So, this place is great! I really like the concept and the taste/quality of the pizza spoke for itself. I ordered the Chipotle pizza, bell pepper instead of banana peppers. I see why they suggest banana though- this pizza needs acidity. I'd probably get roasted reds if I ordered this again. My mom is a traditionalist and got good old fashioned cheese and pepperoni. At close to 2pm, we were the only people there. The manager Jason, a really nice guy, explained the process and all sorts of greaT stuff about the oven itself. The interior is really nice! I liked the industrial like exposed duct work, etc. I'm coming back next week with 2 friends and 2 little girls, 2 & 4 years old. Will see how it goes! Looking forward to coming back!
Their gluten free pizza is not gluten free.  Sliced with the same cutter as every other pizza (Oh, and although I previously suggested that they use a different tub of sauce for gluten free pizzas, since they touch the ladle all over the crust and dip it back in the sauce repeatedly, they just grab a different ladle for you and use the contaminated sauce).   The toppings are also cross contaminated, too, since they are reaching in the bins after handling the crust.  I've been there twice and got (Celiac) sick each time- not coming back again.  Don't bother offering a gluten free crust if you won't take basic precautions to avoid cross-contact, even when your customers suggest easy changes!
Fantastic fast fired pizza. I normally go for the 3 meat, which is awesomely delicious.
Excellent pizza fast. So many toppings to choose from. They have suggested pizzas but I created my own. Meatball banana pepp and ricotta cheese. So good. Owner is friendly. Recommended bringing kids in Sunday since they would get a free pizza for each pizza I ordered. Right off 290 exit, a lot more parking in back if front lot is full.
First time at Pi Craft and it's definitely not going to be the last. This place is great, I love the concept! (Reminds me of Chipotle because of the build-your-own) Originally had planned on ordering pizza from a local pizza parlor, but so glad I found this place instead. Amazed at the low traffic this place brought, would have expected to have a decent amount of people, much like chipotle's busy atmosphere, but then again I liked how quiet and relaxing the atmosphere was. The staff was friendly and helpful. So many choices, I can't wait to go back again. Oh! And I love how fast the service was and how fresh the ingredients were. Definitely recommend trying this place out.

Delicious, hand-crafted, wood-fired stove pizza on a multigrain crust with an assortment of fresh sauces, vegetable and meat toppings, and herbed oils to choose from. All delicious, fresh ingredients. And I love that they have spiced-turkey sausage available. As good as the pizzas that you'll find in the upscale restaurants, and very reasonably-priced-and they don't charge you per topping -- pizza's are just one price.. The manager, Adam, was very attentive and went out of his way to make sure our needs were met. We will be going back often -- a true WNY gem. Delicious food and terrific service! Kids under 12 eat free on Sundays and Tuesdays.
Pi craft is a cute addition to the area.  The food tastes great, all the ingredients are very fresh.  They offer Johhny Ryan fountain soda which is awesome!  I'm a pretty plain person when it comes to pizza so I just got the basic cheese pizza, but it tasted so good.

Since it's opening, I've really enjoyed the food, at least twice a month. The girls in my salon will pitch in for a pizza and we will split it. I love the more gourmet feel to the toppings and that they will easily substitute items. My favorite is the Chipotle pizza. Men, I would recommend getting an entire pizza for yourself, since they are a thinner crust with 14 inch size. DON'T FORGET TO PARK OUT BACK!!!
My all time favorite spot for pizza!!! Ingredients are all fresh and service is excellent!!!
It's not the best pizza that I've ever had.... but the concept is fantastic, everything tastes fresh and yummy, the place is clean and bright, and everyone who works here is very friendly and helpful. Last night my son and I had dinner here.  We each had a "Craft Your Own Pizza" and we shared a salad.  There are 6 different "Pi Pizzas" to choose from..... but it's so much more fun to pick your own toppings and have your own creation.  And, it's very nice that the price is the same ($8.50 each) whether you choose one topping or get everything they have to offer piled on your crust.   The place works like an assembly line of sorts.  First you pick your crust (multi-grain or gluten-free) and then move on down the line to choose sauce (plain tomato, herbed red sauce, chopotle BBQ, pesto, olive oil and garlic.....), cheese (mozzarella, ricotta, cheddar, Gorgonzola, Parmesan....), meats (including choice filet, chicken, and house-made meatballs....), and many, many veggies.  Then everything is assembled and it goes through a super-fast pizza oven.  In less than 10 minutes your pizza is ready.  Fresh, hot, and personalized!   There are also focaccia sandwiches (6 varieties)  and chopped salads (3 varieties). That's really the only thing I would change about the menu.  I would love it if there was a "Craft Your Own Salad" option.  the "Mexican Bowl" (with chick peas instead of braised pork) was delicious.  We especially loved the Black Bean & Corn Relish and the Chipotle Lime Vinaigrette Dressing.  Everything worked well together and it was nice to see all of the fresh ingredients chopped up right in front of us.  The addition of quinoa make that salad a complete meal on its own. All in all "Pi Craft" is a great place to grab a quick, fresh, filling, and healthy alternative to the usual fast food meal.  I'll definitely be back.

EXCELLENT! Cheap fast delicious and perfect! I will be here like everyday ha! The food is so good. No waiter service which makes it that much cheaper and good portion size! Manager Adam was a HUGE help for my husband and I's first time, explained everything and SO NICE!! YOU HAVE TO COME HERE!!!!
Ordered Mexican and Chipotle Pie. And 2 Waters (Cup). Summary: Very friendly, good food, fast. Each pizza is about a 10-11 inch, I'm not so good at estimating.

I was recently told that yelp keeps small business owners up at night.  This review will allow for sweet dreams.   I do try new pizzas in town, and am very fond of Lovejoys on Main near Allen.  Its seriously good Buffalo style pizza.  What I remember from my youth.   But this pizza is what I crave as an adult.   The flavors are actually thought through, textured and layered.   They have 6 that they make as standard, but you can also make your own.   When I went the first time I asked the person behind the counter what the "best seller" was.  His answer was, last week Meat (I think) and this week Chipoltle BBQ (I know).  Wow.  He knew immediately.  Impressive.  Even given that info I tried the artichoke and ham one, which was not the best seller either week.  But it sounded so good.   And it was.   The bread is perfect (for me), not too thick, cooks well in the 700 degree oven, nice crust - strong enough to hold the peice by hand, yet small enough to eat easily as well.  The employee asked if I wanted "drizzle" on top after it came out of the oven.  I suggested they just do whatever they think makes the best pizza.  So I dont know what the drizzel was, but it did add to the flavoring all around.   I'll be back for this pizza. These pizzas are made in front of you and then put into the visible oven, the first of it's kind in NY I gather.   It reappears a few minutes later.  It's 8.5 inches I believe, which I think is a perfect size.   I have since tried the BBQ chicken, the best seller.  It was very good as well, but I'll stick with the underdog artichoke in the future.  But if you read my reviews you know I dont do much BBQ, and this had less Chipoltle flavor than I expected.   We have had the chick pea chopped salad as well.  It was great.  Really great.  And really chopped, like I used to get daily in NYC.   Harder to find around here.  Its a generous portion, easily enough for a lunch meal (with some left for dinner).  We added quinoa, which was a nice addition.  House dressing on the side, also good.   Surprisingly a dining companion picked up the apple pie.  I had not even seen that on the menu (I dont really get past the pizza part of the menu).  It was a generous size, we brought some home, warmed it up later and enjoyed with icecream.  Terrific. They offer a few things here - The "house pizzas" are all interesting and easily get my attention.  However, you can make your own as well, and they offer half pizzas for $5.50.   You can choose a foccia-wich as well - the "house suggestions" look very good, with "a choice for everyone".   There are vegetarian and gluten free options here. The space is very large, and I imagine they may have some heating and cooling bills they wont be fond of, but its nice, clean and "fresh".  Parking is not good, but there is a large lot in the back as well.  When the school opens again I can see parking getting more challenging.   5 stars - they still have some tweaking to do, but its a mom and pop (although they are in Geneseo I think), its a fresh new idea for Buffalo (that takes guts), its priced right (given the hands-on touch for each order), the seating is comfortable and easy, the music is not too loud (often a problem in "Hard Rock Buffalo" pizza joints) and, important to me, the employees seem to be happy to be working there.   They take CASH of course, and Visa, MC, Amex. I did not ask, but assume wifi is on the way, although not yet there.  Who does not have wifi these days? Thanks Carley M!  Your review got me here, and I'm glad it did.

Remember Kramer from Seinfeld came up with a pizza place where you make your own pizza pie.  Well Pi let's you do that without getting your hands dirty.  This great new pizza place will definitely deter me from going to the Blvd. Mall - I'd rather go design a pizza instead.  The atmosphere is pleasant and clean, the toppings are endless, and the staff ready to serve and please.  Within minutes I had a delicious pizza - fresh and hot and full of flavor.   Bring the kids, bring a date, bring a fussy friend- I know they will all love Pi!!!!
Just discovered this place!  Boy, what a delicious pizza. I'm so freakin' excited.  Finally some killer, quick, thin crust, create your own, scrumptious "pi" in Buffalo.  Can't wait to return.  The manager was extremely cool too.
I finally ventured out here and utilized the awesome promotional card that Wayne (thanks Wayne!!) gave me at the most recent Yelp Elite event.  Upon reading Jody's review, I figured I should go with a create your own.  I chose the herbed red sauce with mozzarella, parmesan, and some fresh mozzarella curds that the owner insisted on me trying.  For starters, it's nice that you can control the amount of cheese.  I really hate cheesy pizza, so this was nice for me to get just the right amount.  For toppings I got the caramelized onions, the roasted seasonal veggies (squash, zucchini, and mushrooms), turkey sausage, spinach, and basil. Upon bringing out the card Wayne gave me, the owner gave me a weirdly difficult time at first, but it turns out he had misheard me, and did not realize who I was talking about.  Once he realized where and who the cards came from, he graciously honored it. The pizza was very good -- it was warm but not too hot, which does make me wonder how long the heat would stay if you were to get it "to-go".  It's not the best pizza in the world, but I can definitely see the appeal.  It was not overly greasy (YES, I am someone who may be seen dabbing grease off pizza), but I did find myself craving just a teensy bit more salt/spice.  That's why I deducting the star... I was craving a little bit more.  A big plus for having Johnny Ryan pop and Stewart's Root Beer in the fountain pop machine; I have never seen those! While we were eating, he came over and was talking to us a bit about the restaurant and while we disagreed about putting in a city location (again, here is pretentious old city-loving me talking), I could tell he had a knack for the business.  Overall, the workers were great and the food was good.  I do wish Pi Craft nothing but the best for their ambitious business endeavors!
I love being able to improve my ratings for restaurants over time and this place totally deserves the upgrade.  I have been here about fives times and each experience has surpassed the last.  The staff is really friendly and patient.  If you're lucky enough to come in while the manager/owner is there he will greet you with an enthusiastic hello and guide you through the pizza making process.  Their house made pesto is the way to go, although friends of mine have tried the red sauce and say it's superb as well. They haven't officially named a pizza after me (ha, ha) but if they did it would consist of multi grain crust, pesto sauce, mozzarella, spinach, roasted red peppers, caramelized onions, tomatoes, grilled chicken topped with the herb basil after bake. Alright enough with the watering mouths, I know, it sounds fabulous and IT IS. Everything is so fresh and has such flavor.   If you are a big fan of cheese then definitely go with the mozzarella AND the fresh mozzarella curds.  It's the perfect combination and the manager describes the duo as tasting like a mozzarella stick, only without all the artery clogging fried junk. (Yes, cheese is okay for you sometimes, google it.) This place really has healthy options for every kind of dieter.  I will admit, the gluten free crust isn't my favorite, only because the consistency is slightly different than that of the multi grain.  With the gluten free crust you're getting more of a soft crust instead of that crunch.  The more toppings you add the more it weighs your slice down so when you pick it up it sort of flops but adding more ingredients does nothing to the cost or the taste so I say pile em on!  I hope this place continues to thrive because it is definitely reasonably priced and a perfect treat when you feel like being bad but also good at the same time.  Nothing wrong with a pizza splurge every once in a while!
Excellent pizza. We like the regular  Buffalo pizzeria's but this is what other city's have that we didn't until now. Go and try it you WILL love it.
It was so good that my family brought home a pie for me. They use fresh ingredients, wonderful sauces, and amazing crust. Hell they have a mission statement (see below). I want to eat this everyday. Pi Craft's mission is to bring healthy, good conscious, real food: pizza, focaccia sandwiches, and chopped salads, to our guests.
I got the triple meat pizza - the pizza had substantially less flavor than I anticipated. The sauce tasted like pure tomato with no spices whatsoever. The parbaked crust was also quite average. My partner made a custom pizza with several veggies and commented that they didn't seem as fresh as they are billed to be. Service was quick, and the atmosphere was nice, but we probably won't return.
Tried today, ordered number 1 to see what these guys got. Not disappointed. Fresh ingredients, nice interior (a lot of copper), warm atmosphere, and good food. There are several different kinds of sauces next to the soda fountain, you can add it to spice it up your way. However, i suggest to try it without anything on it first. Overall taste was clean and fresh. Also I like that they use regular olive oil for before bake, and Extra virgin for after bake drizzle. Simple but careful touch.
What a wonderful concept! This is our second time here and we could not be happier. Atmosphere is open and surprisingly homey. Food is to die for and employees are quite friendly. Both times I happened to order a similar pizza but they were both phenomenal. All your ingredients are laid out right in front of you an workers are not afraid to make suggestions to help add to the flavor of your food. I chose to get a meat pizza both times. Both the pepperoni and the meatballs are amazing, and the meatballs are made in house! The girlfriend got a cheese pizza the first time and a veggie the second, the veggie was definitely more loved. Overall a great experience and would return in the future for sure! Oh did I mention Johnny Ryan on tap?!
I wish this was closer to where I live/work because I could easily see this becoming a regular stop for me. The crust is a good texture, crispy but not thin and not doughy. I like being able to guage the amount of sauce and ask for more. The ingredients are fresh and good quality. I wasn't sure about the "after bake" toppings, but manager (?) Jason encouraged me to try the balsamic drizzle on my white pizza, to which I daringly added garlic and herb oil. Delicious! This is a very good start!
Very good! I prefer a very thin crispy crust pizza, with a nice tomato sauce that is not overdone with spices and sometimes sugar. Very simple ingredients that are clean and fresh. Pi Craft delivered that in less than 10 min! My husband and I stopped in on New Yrs Eve right about the time they were going to close. They stayed open for us and a few other people who walked in right after us. We split the classic cheese, and also split a fountain drink. $9.75. Not bad. The pizza was a perfect size to split, but if I was really hungry I probably could have eaten the whole thing:) the ingredients were really fresh and they have a lot of toppings to choose from. I like that the toppings are also a lil out of the ordinary. I will definitely be back.
A few things: 1. Look at the menu ahead of time and think about what you might want; 2. The parking lot isn't bad really. Don't let that be the deciding factor of coming here; 3. All meals here are under 700 calories! Not shabby at all!; 4. Unlimited toppings; 5. Overpriced beverages (but they do have Johnny Ryan's on the fountain, including grape and cherry flavors); So, this place is great! I really like the concept and the taste/quality of the pizza spoke for itself. I ordered the Chipotle pizza, bell pepper instead of banana peppers. I see why they suggest banana though- this pizza needs acidity. I'd probably get roasted reds if I ordered this again. My mom is a traditionalist and got good old fashioned cheese and pepperoni. At close to 2pm, we were the only people there. The manager Jason, a really nice guy, explained the process and all sorts of greaT stuff about the oven itself. The interior is really nice! I liked the industrial like exposed duct work, etc. I'm coming back next week with 2 friends and 2 little girls, 2 & 4 years old. Will see how it goes! Looking forward to coming back!
There is a difference between something that's hot, something that's warm, something that's been cooked.  If given a choice, 99 of 100 people will admit to you that something baked in an oven tastes better than something nuked in a microwave, further that something cooked more recently tastes significantly better than something cooked less recently.  I don't understand how extant reviews of Pi Craft universally neglect the implications of Pi Craft's modus operandi on the quality of the product served, that each of the crust, sauce, cheese, and toppings components of a pizza fail so much because of its rather unique serving method. See, Pi Craft is another one of those Cold Stone/Chopt/Subway-type restaurants that specializes in quick custom orders.  On entering, you may choose from a list of favorites or else choose your own toppings, crust, sauce, and so forth (all pre-made, pre-cooked, and so forth).  The assembled product travels through a conveyor belt-type oven and emerges on the other side in minutes, now warm to the tongue, never piping hot. One of the delights of taking a bite into a pizza is the either wonderfully warm and fluffy or else wonderfully charred and crispy sensation of the crust of the pizza.  Because the crust here is prebaked and quite dense, it merely reheats in the oven and acquires none of the desired textural qualities.  Moreover, while the crust can come in optional multigrain or gluten-free varieties, none of it arrives with actual flavor, with any indication of even oil, pepper, garlic, or butter utilized.  The thing's bland as canvas, as cardboard, as Dominos pizza was back in the day when only the real schmucks ordered from them. The sauces that Pi Craft employs are quite thin and accordingly heat up quite well in the quick heat of their instant easy bake ovens.  Sauce on the chipotle pizza, for example, was sweet, was saliva inducing, was so overwhelming that components of the rest of the pizza were impossible to discern for reasons I will detail later. The immediate warming of the sauce was only possible because the cheese layer was very, very thin.  As this thin layer melted, it melded with the sauce, becoming a molten mess lacking any flavor or textural note.  Again, one of the virtues of a pizza completely lost.   The cooking method employed also meant that many of the wonderful flavors and textures of toppings elicited thanks to a slow cook time were in utter absence.  Think on pepperoni, chicken, or sausage you would normally consume.  Depth of flavor is achieved only through a cooking process that allows the various spices in which they were likely marinated to rise to the surface.  Anchovies lose some of their fishy edge and gain a savory aspect thanks to the heating.  Proteins, fruits, and some vegetables gain a wonderful char.  Others caramelize, tenderize.  In such an enterprise as Pi Craft, such nuances are impossible to achieve.  On my chicken chipotle pizza, the chicken pieces had been precooked and diced into small bits.  Even so small, not enough time had passed for them to acquire any char.  In essence, they were bumps in the cheese-sauce guck.  Advertised caramelized onions had already been cooked, had sat, had lost any of the sweetness which caramelization affords.  Rather, these were long flavorless strings.  Banana peppers, on the other hand, were uncooked, had not tenderized, offered a bizarre contrast to the cheese-sauce guck.  The wild mushrooms were discernible only after much hunting.   To add insult to injury, these pizzas are all quite small.  Per another reviewer's note, many top out at less than 1,000 calories, a thought with two ramifications:  1) It is very possible to eat all of this pizza and still be hungry.  2) Your calories/dollar ratio is ridiculously poor.  Although considerably less expensive than its competitor Crust in Allentown or any other pizza in general, the value is not there.  After each eating half a pizza at Pi Craft, my sister and I wound up at another Italian place on Hertel Avenue where she consumed half a rather large pasta plate and I consumed all but one slice of a pizza.  In her words, food here constitutes an appetizer.   Though apparently locally owned, everything about Pi Craft has been arranged to remind you of a garden variety chain store.  With but changes to the logo and the menu, you could have sat me in its confines and told me that I was in a Chipotle, a Quizno's, a Coldstone, and I wouldn't have been surprised at all.  Service is Spartan.  Drinks are fountain.   The city of Buffalo boasts a higher pizzeria-to-people ratio than almost anywhere else in the nation.  Many aren't great, but a bunch are excellent.  Given the plethora of available pizza, I can't justify revisiting this joint. 2 stars for food 1 star for value 3 stars for décor/service (chain standard) 2 stars overall
Fantastic fast fired pizza. I normally go for the 3 meat, which is awesomely delicious.
I'm not a thin crust person, but I LOVE Pi Craft's crust! Fresh crust, fresh ingredients, and allergen knowledgeable staff. The Gluten Free pizza crust is great and there is only one topping that isn't Gluten Free as well. Very happy we tried Pi Craft, we will definitely return!
First time at Pi Craft and it's definitely not going to be the last. This place is great, I love the concept! (Reminds me of Chipotle because of the build-your-own) Originally had planned on ordering pizza from a local pizza parlor, but so glad I found this place instead. Amazed at the low traffic this place brought, would have expected to have a decent amount of people, much like chipotle's busy atmosphere, but then again I liked how quiet and relaxing the atmosphere was. The staff was friendly and helpful. So many choices, I can't wait to go back again. Oh! And I love how fast the service was and how fresh the ingredients were. Definitely recommend trying this place out.
Delicious, hand-crafted, wood-fired stove pizza on a multigrain crust with an assortment of fresh sauces, vegetable and meat toppings, and herbed oils to choose from. All delicious, fresh ingredients. And I love that they have spiced-turkey sausage available. As good as the pizzas that you'll find in the upscale restaurants, and very reasonably-priced-and they don't charge you per topping -- pizza's are just one price.. The manager, Adam, was very attentive and went out of his way to make sure our needs were met. We will be going back often -- a true WNY gem. Delicious food and terrific service! Kids under 12 eat free on Sundays and Tuesdays.
Since it's opening, I've really enjoyed the food, at least twice a month. The girls in my salon will pitch in for a pizza and we will split it. I love the more gourmet feel to the toppings and that they will easily substitute items. My favorite is the Chipotle pizza. Men, I would recommend getting an entire pizza for yourself, since they are a thinner crust with 14 inch size. DON'T FORGET TO PARK OUT BACK!!!
It's not the best pizza that I've ever had.... but the concept is fantastic, everything tastes fresh and yummy, the place is clean and bright, and everyone who works here is very friendly and helpful. Last night my son and I had dinner here.  We each had a "Craft Your Own Pizza" and we shared a salad.  There are 6 different "Pi Pizzas" to choose from..... but it's so much more fun to pick your own toppings and have your own creation.  And, it's very nice that the price is the same ($8.50 each) whether you choose one topping or get everything they have to offer piled on your crust.   The place works like an assembly line of sorts.  First you pick your crust (multi-grain or gluten-free) and then move on down the line to choose sauce (plain tomato, herbed red sauce, chopotle BBQ, pesto, olive oil and garlic.....), cheese (mozzarella, ricotta, cheddar, Gorgonzola, Parmesan....), meats (including choice filet, chicken, and house-made meatballs....), and many, many veggies.  Then everything is assembled and it goes through a super-fast pizza oven.  In less than 10 minutes your pizza is ready.  Fresh, hot, and personalized!   There are also focaccia sandwiches (6 varieties)  and chopped salads (3 varieties). That's really the only thing I would change about the menu.  I would love it if there was a "Craft Your Own Salad" option.  the "Mexican Bowl" (with chick peas instead of braised pork) was delicious.  We especially loved the Black Bean & Corn Relish and the Chipotle Lime Vinaigrette Dressing.  Everything worked well together and it was nice to see all of the fresh ingredients chopped up right in front of us.  The addition of quinoa make that salad a complete meal on its own. All in all "Pi Craft" is a great place to grab a quick, fresh, filling, and healthy alternative to the usual fast food meal.  I'll definitely be back.
EXCELLENT! Cheap fast delicious and perfect! I will be here like everyday ha! The food is so good. No waiter service which makes it that much cheaper and good portion size! Manager Adam was a HUGE help for my husband and I's first time, explained everything and SO NICE!! YOU HAVE TO COME HERE!!!!
I was recently told that yelp keeps small business owners up at night.  This review will allow for sweet dreams.   I do try new pizzas in town, and am very fond of Lovejoys on Main near Allen.  Its seriously good Buffalo style pizza.  What I remember from my youth.   But this pizza is what I crave as an adult.   The flavors are actually thought through, textured and layered.   They have 6 that they make as standard, but you can also make your own.   When I went the first time I asked the person behind the counter what the "best seller" was.  His answer was, last week Meat (I think) and this week Chipoltle BBQ (I know).  Wow.  He knew immediately.  Impressive.  Even given that info I tried the artichoke and ham one, which was not the best seller either week.  But it sounded so good.   And it was.   The bread is perfect (for me), not too thick, cooks well in the 700 degree oven, nice crust - strong enough to hold the peice by hand, yet small enough to eat easily as well.  The employee asked if I wanted "drizzle" on top after it came out of the oven.  I suggested they just do whatever they think makes the best pizza.  So I dont know what the drizzel was, but it did add to the flavoring all around.   I'll be back for this pizza. These pizzas are made in front of you and then put into the visible oven, the first of it's kind in NY I gather.   It reappears a few minutes later.  It's 8.5 inches I believe, which I think is a perfect size.   I have since tried the BBQ chicken, the best seller.  It was very good as well, but I'll stick with the underdog artichoke in the future.  But if you read my reviews you know I dont do much BBQ, and this had less Chipoltle flavor than I expected.   We have had the chick pea chopped salad as well.  It was great.  Really great.  And really chopped, like I used to get daily in NYC.   Harder to find around here.  Its a generous portion, easily enough for a lunch meal (with some left for dinner).  We added quinoa, which was a nice addition.  House dressing on the side, also good.   Surprisingly a dining companion picked up the apple pie.  I had not even seen that on the menu (I dont really get past the pizza part of the menu).  It was a generous size, we brought some home, warmed it up later and enjoyed with icecream.  Terrific. They offer a few things here - The "house pizzas" are all interesting and easily get my attention.  However, you can make your own as well, and they offer half pizzas for $5.50.   You can choose a foccia-wich as well - the "house suggestions" look very good, with "a choice for everyone".   There are vegetarian and gluten free options here. The space is very large, and I imagine they may have some heating and cooling bills they wont be fond of, but its nice, clean and "fresh".  Parking is not good, but there is a large lot in the back as well.  When the school opens again I can see parking getting more challenging.   5 stars - they still have some tweaking to do, but its a mom and pop (although they are in Geneseo I think), its a fresh new idea for Buffalo (that takes guts), its priced right (given the hands-on touch for each order), the seating is comfortable and easy, the music is not too loud (often a problem in "Hard Rock Buffalo" pizza joints) and, important to me, the employees seem to be happy to be working there.   They take CASH of course, and Visa, MC, Amex. I did not ask, but assume wifi is on the way, although not yet there.  Who does not have wifi these days? Thanks Carley M!  Your review got me here, and I'm glad it did.
Remember Kramer from Seinfeld came up with a pizza place where you make your own pizza pie.  Well Pi let's you do that without getting your hands dirty.  This great new pizza place will definitely deter me from going to the Blvd. Mall - I'd rather go design a pizza instead.  The atmosphere is pleasant and clean, the toppings are endless, and the staff ready to serve and please.  Within minutes I had a delicious pizza - fresh and hot and full of flavor.   Bring the kids, bring a date, bring a fussy friend- I know they will all love Pi!!!!

Upon bringing out the card Wayne gave me, the owner gave me a weirdly difficult time at first, but it turns out he had misheard me, and did not realize who I was talking about.  Once he realized where and who the cards came from, he graciously honored it. The pizza was very good -- it was warm but not too hot, which does make me wonder how long the heat would stay if you were to get it "to-go".  It's not the best pizza in the world, but I can definitely see the appeal.  It was not overly greasy (YES, I am someone who may be seen dabbing grease off pizza), but I did find myself craving just a teensy bit more salt/spice.  That's why I deducting the star...

I'm not a thin crust person, but I LOVE Pi Craft's crust! Fresh crust, fresh ingredients, and allergen knowledgeable staff. The Gluten Free pizza crust is great and there is only one topping that isn't Gluten Free as well. Very happy we tried Pi Craft, we will definitely return!
Friendly, knowledgable staff with good food. Ingredients are very fresh and pizza is really good. Would like to try their focaccia wich. Happy to see they have organic options and a kids menu (kids eat free Sundays and Mondays)
Unfortunately, this place does NOT have gluten free pizza.   I watched them dip the ladle into the sauce and spread the sauce around on a 'regular' crust then put the ladle back in the sauce and put sauce on my 'gluten free' crust.   Complete and total blatant cross-contamination. When confronted on this issue, almost in a laughing tone, I was told 'we do the best we can do... It's impossible to be completely Celiac Friendly.' There is a complete lack of knowledge on food preparation in dealing with food related illnesses.  This is a serious issue and they probably should be reported to the health department!! There was 100% complete disregard for their customers' health.   If you have Celiac Disease, please do not go here. And for the record, the pizza was horrendous!!! Raw, sent back and was raw again!! Don't go!
Our 1st time here and it surely will not be our last!!! Our pizzas were awesome! We ordered the classic cheese with the basil herb drizzle and the chipotle chicken. They were perfectly cooked with a crisp but chewy crust and had just the right amount of toppings. It was just a delightfully crafted pi! I cannot wait to go back to try another and make one of our own. The girl who took care of us was also super nice and helpful and the place was very clean with a neat minimalist decor. The prices are great and they strive for organic and local whenever possible. Really fun place I hope they stay around for a long time.
This is a good place for pizza! The ingredients are fresh and the crust is verrrrry good . The  3 meat pizza with the plain tomato sauce , mozzarella cheese and chicken,sausage and pepperoni soooo good! The staff are very nice and helpful if you don't know what to try. The prices are pretty cool as well . I will be back;)
My husband stopped here with a friend for lunch a few weeks back and raved about it so we went together last Friday. I love the concept! Subway for pizza really. We split a large pizza which was actually a decent amount for us for our appetite that night. They let us do half and half (as long as we got the same sauce which we chose their homemade red.) Hubby went with a ton of meats and cheese. I got peppers and mushrooms. After it came out of the brick over, they drizzled it with a basil sauce. It was crispy and really tasty! All for under $10.00. We will definitely go back!
I saw a friend post a picture about this place on his facebook, and saw his pizza creation which prompted me to visit this place when I had time. The concept of creating your own pizza pie I thought was clever. You get to choose what type of sauce, cheese, meat, and other additional toppings you want on your pizza. The nice thing is you get to put as many toppings you would like. Another thing that I liked was all the ingredients looked very fresh. The employee who was making my pizza whom I'm assuming must have been the manager was kind enough to make recommendations on which toppings might not work well together. The pizza probably took about 3-5mins to bake and I was pleasantly surprised on how good the pizza was. I Feel this probably a more healthy alternative to other fast food places. I definitely recommend this place to other people who are fans of pizza.
Customize your pizza any way you like, and get it hot, fresh and delicious in under ten minutes. Highly recommended.
Pi Craft can be summed up best in one word...  INCREDIBLE! I have now had the pleasure of enjoying most of their signature pizzas and today, my first sandwich.  Every item I have tried has been a new experience. My wife and three daughters joined me today.  With a few picky eaters in the group, I was wondering how it was going to go... What a hit!  They all loved their creations! We will definitely be back, soon!!!
Stopped here for lunch the other day. Definitely a different kind of pizza experience than you usually get in Buffalo. I thought the pizza was very good. It was piping hot and the crust was crunchy. Very tasty and the staff was extremely nice and very helpful. Great place for a quick bite to eat. I'll definitely be back.
Friendly, knowledgable staff with good food. Ingredients are very fresh and pizza is really good. Would like to try their focaccia wich. Happy to see they have organic options and a kids menu (kids eat free Sundays and Mondays)
Picked up dinner here today because of rave reviews on Yelp. It was very, very good. It was also very quick. The employees were very friendly as well as attentive. My only complaint is that the pizzas are a little small for the price. However, that won't deter me from coming back! I will be back soon :)
Unfortunately, this place does NOT have gluten free pizza.   I watched them dip the ladle into the sauce and spread the sauce around on a 'regular' crust then put the ladle back in the sauce and put sauce on my 'gluten free' crust.   Complete and total blatant cross-contamination. When confronted on this issue, almost in a laughing tone, I was told 'we do the best we can do... It's impossible to be completely Celiac Friendly.' There is a complete lack of knowledge on food preparation in dealing with food related illnesses.  This is a serious issue and they probably should be reported to the health department!! There was 100% complete disregard for their customers' health.   If you have Celiac Disease, please do not go here. And for the record, the pizza was horrendous!!! Raw, sent back and was raw again!! Don't go!
Try the bbq chicken pizza!  My son & I absolutely love it! The staff is fantastic, too!
Our 1st time here and it surely will not be our last!!! Our pizzas were awesome! We ordered the classic cheese with the basil herb drizzle and the chipotle chicken. They were perfectly cooked with a crisp but chewy crust and had just the right amount of toppings. It was just a delightfully crafted pi! I cannot wait to go back to try another and make one of our own. The girl who took care of us was also super nice and helpful and the place was very clean with a neat minimalist decor. The prices are great and they strive for organic and local whenever possible. Really fun place I hope they stay around for a long time.
I tried Pi Craft thanks to Channel 7 news' deal of the day. I must have passed it a few times as it is literally down the road for me. Needless to say, I'm there at least once a week now. The pizza's, the salads! I can't put into words how good they are. I have yet to try a sandwich. All the ingredients are fresh, organic, natural, from local farms, and healthy! The manager shows his passion for the place every time you go in. I wish Pi Craft much success in the New Year!
This is a good place for pizza! The ingredients are fresh and the crust is verrrrry good . The  3 meat pizza with the plain tomato sauce , mozzarella cheese and chicken,sausage and pepperoni soooo good! The staff are very nice and helpful if you don't know what to try. The prices are pretty cool as well . I will be back;)
I went in yesterday and got a meatball ficaciawich. The best sandwich I've ever had. When I went back to the office I told a free people I work with how delicious it was. Today 5 people from the office went down and everyone loved everything they got. This place is awesome.
My husband stopped here with a friend for lunch a few weeks back and raved about it so we went together last Friday. I love the concept! Subway for pizza really. We split a large pizza which was actually a decent amount for us for our appetite that night. They let us do half and half (as long as we got the same sauce which we chose their homemade red.) Hubby went with a ton of meats and cheese. I got peppers and mushrooms. After it came out of the brick over, they drizzled it with a basil sauce. It was crispy and really tasty! All for under $10.00. We will definitely go back!
After weeks of anticipation Pi Craft opened today! I ordered a Classic Cheese and I built one of my own - a Classic Cheese with pepperoni, green peppers and onions. Both were finished in less than 5 minutes and it was one of the BEST pizzas that I've had in Western NY! The flavor was almost like a hybrid of a New York style pizza and a wood-fired pizza. Sauce was perfect, not too sweet. You could tell the pepperoni was high quality - it did not contain pools of grease like every other pizza place in Buffalo. The vegetables were extremely fresh. I barely scratched the surface of what the menu has to offer - they have tons of combinations, including after baking toppings, oil drizzles, etc. I'm going back tomorrow! Pros: Great Flavor, Friendly Service, Fast! Cons: Parking lot is a little small - when it gets busy that may be a hassle.
I saw a friend post a picture about this place on his facebook, and saw his pizza creation which prompted me to visit this place when I had time. The concept of creating your own pizza pie I thought was clever. You get to choose what type of sauce, cheese, meat, and other additional toppings you want on your pizza. The nice thing is you get to put as many toppings you would like. Another thing that I liked was all the ingredients looked very fresh. The employee who was making my pizza whom I'm assuming must have been the manager was kind enough to make recommendations on which toppings might not work well together. The pizza probably took about 3-5mins to bake and I was pleasantly surprised on how good the pizza was. I Feel this probably a more healthy alternative to other fast food places. I definitely recommend this place to other people who are fans of pizza.
Customize your pizza any way you like, and get it hot, fresh and delicious in under ten minutes. Highly recommended.
This place was amazing! Everything was so fresh, the workers were so friendly and helpful and the food was amazing! The prices are so reasonable and you get a lot for the money! I highly recommend trying this place
Pi Craft can be summed up best in one word...  INCREDIBLE! I have now had the pleasure of enjoying most of their signature pizzas and today, my first sandwich.  Every item I have tried has been a new experience. My wife and three daughters joined me today.  With a few picky eaters in the group, I was wondering how it was going to go... What a hit!  They all loved their creations! We will definitely be back, soon!!!
I like good pizza. I like good humor. I like good service. I like style. The Pi Craft has all of these things. I ordered three meats pizza, it is outstanding. I really mean it. Pizza is crusty, juicy, ingredients are fresh and perfectly balanced. I live in the New York city, and there are many good pizzerias, the Pi Craft could easily kick out of business many of them. I am happy I live far from this place, otherwise I would gain too many extra pounds in no time. But I will definitely come again next time I am in the area.

Very tasty and the staff was extremely nice and very helpful. Great place for a quick bite to eat. I'll definitely be back.
Pros:  the pizza is cooked very fast in a conveyer style "brick oven";  from order to checkout with piping hot pizza in hand took only about 5 minutes;  reasonable cost- I paid $13 for what I would describe as a medium size pepperoni pizza with mozzarella and parmesan cheese and a fountain drink;  the herb tomato sauce was quite tasty and brought what would have otherwise been a below average overall taste experience to at least average;  lots of options for complete customization of your pizza. Cons:  although of reasonably good taste and consistency the dough is pre-cooked as is necessary to deliver a finished pie in under 5 minutes, this detracts from the aesthetic experience of watching a fresh pizza dough being shaped and topped (think of pre-made pizza crusts you can buy in your local grocery store);  the bottom of the dough was crispy and nicely browned, but the top of the pizza was less well done; while many toppings were available they did not offer anchovies which for many pizza gourmands are non-negotiable.   Final thought:  if you are looking for a highly customizable, decent tasting pizza in record time Pi Craft will deliver.

If your from the Buffalo area I'll save you a trip not worth it. If your from outside of buffalo you may actually enjoy the pizza.  The pizza is a step above little ceasars or gas station pizza. The ingrediants options are plentiful but lack bacon and real sausage not turkey sausage. They have johnny ryan soda fountain drinks and other more natural drinks like juices and organic milk. If your in the area and want some pizza quick and dont mind overpaying this may be the place for you. The staff is helpful and friendly and is the reason for a 3 star rating vs a 2.
Try the bbq chicken pizza!  My son & I absolutely love it! The staff is fantastic, too!
So excited to have found a new gluten free pizza spot that is fresh, affordable, and has lots of options for customization.  The staff are super friendly and helpful.  A loyalty club would be a great perk, as I plan on eating here often!  It would also be great if they could sell craft beer, bc then this could be an all in one Friday night or happy hour spot.  Great addition to Amherst either way!

Before reading my review, glance down at Alex K's review.....Ok, done? Now that you've read that, you can go ahead and completely disregard it. No, really, just erase it from your memory bank!! I live in the area and was not only one of the first customers, but I personally had a chance to talk to the owner and was able to get the full run-down/tour. They use a brick/stone conveyer oven that pumps out heat well over 600 degrees, pretty far from an "easy bake oven" if you ask me. I actually did some research on similar style ovens and let me tell you, not only are they not cheap, but they are pretty complex when it comes to shoving pizza dough in them. Then there is the food.. There is NOTHING "prepackaged" or "pre-made" about Pi Craft. Not only have I been a chef for 10 years, but I have eaten at enough great "from scratch" restaurants and typical chain style restaurants to know the difference between fresh and preprepared ingredients. Their salads are fresh (cut right from heads of iceberg and romaine heads) and their dressings/sauces are unique and tasty. The pizza toppings are fresh and wonderful, too! I mean how many pizza places serve you braised pork on top of your pie? If your answer was yes, how many of those places actually do it right? One of my favorite ways to eat meat!! Hell, they even put it in their salad! (I highly recommend trying to Mexican salad they offer) They even caramelize onions the correct way, I have been to decent restaurants that still serve me barely cooked onions on my burgers and try to declare them as "caramelized". A bonus to a quick-serve style restaurant if you ask me! As far as the dough goes, yes, it's not pressed out right in front of you, they are pre made shells. Don't let that make you think what you're getting isn't top quality. As far as quality goes, yes, I agree that if it was made from dough ball to pizza right there, it would have a different, more appealing texture. That doesn't mean it still doesn't taste great! By "par-cooking" the shells, They are just pressing out their dough and cooking it just until the crust has risen slightly and there is a slight char to the bottom of the pie. I can tell that by just glancing over the counter when I'm there, you don't even need to be a cook to recognize that process. They aren't slopping sauce and ingredients on to a pizza shell that has been almost fully cooked and serving you barely cooked ingredients on top of a fully booked crust. I have had every pizza on the menu and even created some of my own with the numerous ingredients they offer and I have never had a bad pie.   All in all, Pi craft is taking a go at a concept that is quite new to the restaurant industry, and to Buffalo, for the matter and they are doing a knock out job, thus far. They serve fresh and healthy ingredients, right down to their drinks/chips. (love the soda they offer) I would highly recommend checking them out if you are ever in the area! OH and I almost forgot! Try the "Ham Jam",  it's by far my favorite "Focaccia-wich"
I went in yesterday and got a meatball ficaciawich. The best sandwich I've ever had. When I went back to the office I told a free people I work with how delicious it was. Today 5 people from the office went down and everyone loved everything they got. This place is awesome.
Great food, everything is freshly made and the different choices are great. Being from this area there are a lot of different pizza places. This place took pizza and put a very delicious spin on it. The balsamic drizzle is amazing. Staff and manager is friendly and fast.

Very good - much better than the new Crust in Allentown (both on value and quality). High quality ingredients, friendly folks, and a nice atmosphere - so far the service has been pretty quick and worth it. I've enjoyed the Chipolte BBQ chicken twice now and its' almost as good as Wolfgang Puck and California Pizza Kitchen. I like this concept -I hope they expand.
This place was amazing! Everything was so fresh, the workers were so friendly and helpful and the food was amazing! The prices are so reasonable and you get a lot for the money! I highly recommend trying this place
This pizza is really great.  Its not your typical Buffalo pizza.  I'll definitely be back.  The crust is fantastic.
I was beyond impressed with Pi Craft, when you first walk in you get the amazing smell of fresh pizza and a cool atmosphere that's laid back but cool. I had a basic pizza with basil and a after bake basil oil. Simply put it was to die for, I'm so glad I live close to this gem because I'll be back often! Amazing product at an affordable price! Not to mention staff that are friendly which is hard to find these days! Thank you so much for a delicious dinner! I'll be back very soon!

I had the #2, Excellent!!! Quality toppings I just ordered and let them do the rest and took it easy, they know what they're doing.  I'll be back to tweek and try different combos' forsure.  Good Stuff.

pizza crust is pre made and not fresh there sauce is not very flavorful and over all just a mediocre pizza nothing special and the pizza are pretty small do not recommend as other places around the same area are a lot better
