Now, this is my kind of theater! I LOVE the seating. It's spacious, the aisles allow for ample leg room, and the acoustics are great! This is definitely my favorite theater in Buffalo. Annoys the bleep out of me that most broadway shows come to Shea's and not here. I actually think this facility is better suited to live theater than Shea's. I've seen several shows here (from Rent to India Arie), have had a few graduations here, have even been to a few school orientations here in the atrium, and have performed here myself too. It's wonderful. My only complaint from seeing the Brian Setzer Orchestra perform their Christmas Concert here the other night, is that some seating (the middle back area) isn't optimally designed to see the stage well. Especially if you have tall people sitting in front of you. And actually, the Brian Setzer concert was SUPER loud. I was glad I had my noise-cancelling ear buds on me. I used them as ear plugs. The best show I've ever seen here was India Arie in 2006. It was AMAZING. I love her as a performer and the intimacy of this venue (we sat like 6th row) made is so amazing. More shows should go on here!!! BTW, if you're looking for better parking, park on the lake side of the Center (back past the Flint Village Apartments). You'll have to walk up very steep steps (kind of cagey when icy) but you'll walk right in. Great access point!

I love this venue! They host a huge array of productions, from stand-up comedy to Broadway musicals. I have seen at least 6 different events here and I can honestly say, there is no bad seat in the house... I haven't actually sat in the very last seat of the balcony... but I can speak for the second to last row of the orchestra. My favorites areas are Orchestra Center near Row Q and the first 2 rows of the Loge. One of my favorite things about this venue is the ease of parking, even if you are late! Just note that you may have to walk a long distance though. All the lots say something about "Permit Required"...or something like that, but I have never had any problems. The last time I was here with my girlfriend we saw TAO (very fun show, I was seriously smiling the whole time). It had been one of those days where we were rushing all day. On the way to the theatre I though we were running late and was stressing out. This is when quick easy parking is a game-changer. When we got inside the building we realized that we had about 20 minutes before curtain-up. That was great news, but we needed a drink so bad, we were seriously stressed out...   Inside there were a lot of tables occupied by students and what I suppose were other theater goers. Even though my partner and I really wanted/needed a drink we decided to walk towards the theater entrance, since this is a university venue we didn't think there would be a place to buy a drinks.... luckily we were wrong. Near the theater entrance they had a beer and wine bar setup. Yay! When it was time to go in the theater, the staff was very friendly and quickly to offer an elevator ride. My girlfriend is having to walk with a cane for a while since she had 2 ankle surgeries less than 4 months ago. The gentleman operating the elevator was super nice, he was even waiting for us during intermission and at the end of the show. After such a stressful day going to see a great and fun show with no additional hassles and nothing but nice people was priceless!!!

I have been here a number of times throughout the years.  Most recently to hear Walter Mosely speak earlier this year and then Steven Pinker this past week. The facility is so nice.  Parking is a little farther away than I would have imagined in Buffalo winters, but ok.   The facility is clean, well lit, nice little coffee stand inside, great seating both In the lobby and in the theater.  It holds about 1400 people we were told., but the traffic flow is so good you don't feel rushed or crushed.  We have been to a few small catered events there, and the catering is fine, but its catering, so keep that in mind.   If you have a chance to go see something here, you should go, its nice, comfortable, great acoustics, small enough to really see well, etc.

I'm a fan of the shows that come through here! There's a great variety of performances, from stars like Morrisey to Russian ballet (Nutcracker, Swan Lake), comedy and just about everything in between. The building itself is beautiful and has ample parking (although it's a 5-10m walk away). The main Theater is a standard proscenium, although they sometimes have tickets to shows in the Black Box Theater -- while those shows are generally student-acted. Although you're not allowed to bring any food into the Theater, they do sell coffee and snacks before the shows and during intermission, but the choices are generally simple (chips, candy, etc). I'm originally from Russia and I'm used to Theaters serving caviar sandwiches and delightful pies and pastries in between performances and it's upsetting that you don't get that sort of experience much around here. I've never had any trouble with seating and the staff has always been extremely pleasant to deal with. As one other reviewer have mentioned, the one big problem with coming here is...getting out, after a show. For sold out shows, there are traffic jams which will delay you getting out for up to a half hour. If you're with good company and you're not in a hurry to get home, it's no problem..but otherwise, it can put a bit of a damper into your night. Nonetheless, if there's a good show you want to see, don't let that stop you from coming here. It's a great space!

This is a great theater with amazing acoustics and good views from just about everywhere. It's a good size - big enough for decent acts to come through, but not so big that you dread sitting in the last row (like Shea's). It is part of the University so parking can be dicey, but not if you don't mind walking a bit (come on, it's good for you anyways). The CFA has done a good job of attracting interesting acts and speakers and always accommodates the students, which is a good thing for a venue that exists as part of a school! Always clean, lots of space and bathrooms, and an educated staff. I love this venue!

Awesome acoustics and there is not a bad seat in the place. Large lobby with refreshments and lots of free parking, although it's an uphill walk to the theater.

I saw Morrissey here last week and the venue was just perfect for an 80's love child like myself, who used to cry during the opening bass of 'How Soon is Now', because I was all crazy and shit back in 1985. I was way way way up top in the nosebleeders section and still had a clear view of the stage, and Mozzer's sexy chest.   The seats are high-backed and comfy. Lots of bathrooms.  Nice and clean. Plenty of parking, close by, so I didn't want to blow my brains out while traipsing through 100 miles of parking lots to get to my car after the show. Two thumbs up!

If you wander around the CFA, you will see examples of students' work hanging on the walls. It usually consists of charcoal drawings and digital photos. So if you come early, you can take a peek and get an idea of what goes on in a classroom. Shows I've seen at the CFA were a Night of Belly Dancing, Baba Yaga, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Augusten Burroughs, Craig Ferguson and Colin Mochrie & Brad Sherwood. I enjoyed them all! I recommend that you buy your tickets early for anything that you really want to see. When I saw Baryshnikov, there were people outside begging for tickets. And these were not one or two people. These were entire families. You just never know what will sell out. Or if you wait until the last minute, you will get rotten seats. I sat in the last row of the balcony for Craig Ferguson and I couldn't see anything. While you are not allowed to bring food into the theater, they do sell refreshments before the show - such as beer and bagged chips. There are also vending machines in the basement. This way, you have something to do if you come early. The ticket window is also opened an hour before the performance in case you are cutting it close. The ushers are very nice, sweet people, but I have yet to be helped to my seat. I just get a casual wave and a "somewhere near the middle" instruction. But that's quite fine because it's not like the theater is a maze. The seats are clearly labeled. However, that may pose a problem if you come late and the theater is dark. Parking is a nightmare if you are looking for something close! But if you don't mind the walk, there is plenty to be found. However, making your getaway can sometimes prove difficult. It's a college, so there are still new drivers, some of which who have never driven in snow before. Keep that in mind. Plus, a popular show means crowded parking. In which case, it is going to take you longer to exit the parking lot. Plus, if class is still in session, the students are going to want their parking spots too.   The CFA offers wonderful performances and guests. I love receiving the booklet every year so that I can plan out who I want to see. I can always find at least one performance that I can't wait for. However, I find some of the ticket prices extremely expensive. I can't help but take that random renovation fee personal. :)

Attending the WYRK, Country 106.5, Fall Acoustic Concert, featuring Easton Corbin, Charlie Worsham, and Joel Crouse.  I am accompanied by Carley Mealey.  I always enjoy attending one of these events.  Being able to enjoy the performers stripped down music is great without all the other band members.  There are always up and coming country artists at these events and again I was not disappointed.  Waiting for the next WYRK event there.
Great venue to see a show or lecture or for a reception - there is plenty of wide open space along with a unique art gallery attached to it.  The acoustics in the auditoriums are wonderful and there isn't a bad seat in the house!
