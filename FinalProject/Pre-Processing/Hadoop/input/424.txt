What a fantastic place! Came to see The Curious Case of Phineas Gage and really loved the space and the vibe. It was an intimate theatre, allowing you to really get up close with the performers. You can tell that the staff have a true vested interest in the place. I felt like I had stumbled upon a true gem and wish this arts center was a little closer to me.
Comfy seats. Small theater, but that means every seat is a great seat. Comedy Improv needs work.  Stephen "with a PH" should look for a different career instead of comedy.  Bill (the lead man) is good. Cheap, only $10. Need to be courageous, as you might get pulled onto stage EASILY.
Love this place! Tiny theater makes you feel that much more wrapped in the show. I've seen a couple of productions here, and I wasn't disappointed. Great vibe. Cafe is decent also.
