Been going here for a while for odds and ends (bike replacement parts, etc) and advice.  Always good service.  When recently shopping for a new bike, received a lot of helpful information and advice.  They even set up a bike in an alternate configuration (requiring swapping out the stem) to attempt a better fit.  Did not end up buying from HA as they don't carry the bike that best met my needs, but I would have been very comfortable buying from them if they had.
I bought my skis here several years ago and get them tuned up once a year or so. Today I came back so my boyfriend could possibly buy a pair of skis. The staff was very helpful and helped him find a pair that was affordable and within price restrictions, and he walked out with an awesome set of skis / boots / poles. I recommend buying late in the season to get the best discounts. One great thing about High Adventure is that they will size-adjust boots for you after you buy them there. So if you walk out with boots, go for your first ski run and decide they're squeezing your toes, they'll adjust them for no extra price. I'm not sure if the prices here are the best price you can get, but the staff will do binding adjustments, boot adjustments, and the whole nine yards. If you know what kind of skis you want already, sure, buy them online. But if you want somebody to help you make a purchase, I can't think of a better place to shop for skis in the Capital District. This place also has a ton of mountain biking equipment if you're into that, with a few road and racing bikes as well.
Excellent Customer service and the best prices I could find in the area on Fuji Bikes.  They listened to my needs and fit me to a perfect bike!  If they don't have it, they will find it and order it!
