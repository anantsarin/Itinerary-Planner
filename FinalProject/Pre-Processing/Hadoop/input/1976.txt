Great. I moved to upstate New York for school from Southern California and had to find a salon for personal grooming. I had a wonderful experience here and I'm glad I found it. I highly recommend her: fast, friendly and relatively painless. I'll for sure be making another appointment soon.
Little Owl is absolutely adorable!! So inviting, warm and relaxing.  Kiki is AMAZING.  I went for a wax and I will definitely be going back!!! :)
From the minute I met Kiki I knew I was in good hands. One of the best massages I have ever had and I have had the luxury of having many of them. She worked on my back with such care and detail as well as working the rest of my body. I am SO happy to have found her.
This place is a secret that's too good not to tell. Today was my first time here, and I loved the experience.  I had a wax done, and it was easily the quickest, most painless, and thorough wax I've ever had... and I've been getting them for years at various salons all over the country (and world).  Kiki is so sweet and so easy to chat with, and clearly very good at what she does. The ambiance of the place is wonderful.  It's small and intimate - just one room and a waiting room, but the warm, eclectic decor is so homey and welcoming.  It's hidden away in an office building like a secret nesting place for all the little antiques and owl statues, obviously meticulously collected and placed with a rustically elegant style. Add to this that the prices are reasonable and the products are all natural, and it's honestly the best I've ever found.  I'll definitely go back for more waxes, and I want to try out all her skin treatments, too.

Little Owl is the best! The two room space is adorable and relaxing and even though its on a busy street in Poughkeepsie, it was quiet and felt tucked away. My Cleanse facial felt great and my skin has been glowing for days since! Kiki is a talented lady and I always feel like I'm in great hands when I see her for a massage or facial.

I moved to the New Paltz area recently from NYC and have been looking for a good spa and place to get a waxing.  What a find!  Kiki is wonderful - a great manner and personality, her place is beautiful and she does a fantastic facial!  My skin is still glowing!  Obviously there is no way I could say that a Brazilian is going to be exactly pleasant . . .   but Kiki's was one of the least uncomfortable I've ever had! And she is very careful and thorough.  The Little Owl Spa stands up against any of the fancy NY spas I used to go to!  I will definitely be coming back!

Kiki is excellent! The atmosphere of the little owl is so relaxing. I got a wax here and could not be happier with the results. Kiki was meticulous and thorough. I will definitely be going back.
