I'm originally from the Hudson Valley, but I was in town last Friday and decided to meet up with an old friend at this new place. I had heard good things about this place, and decided to multi-task by checking this place out while catching up. The location is on Main Street, and it is hard to miss, so no worries if  you are from out of town. The bad news is that it's close to the "not so nice" part of Poughkeepsie (upon parking on the street, I was promptly greeted with one of the local "upstanding gentlemen" about how I needed to talk to him, and then give him $2). Not much of an issue for a grown man, but ladies, watch out. The restaurant itself is very well decorated, and has a bistro look that goes for classy and trendy at the same time. I couldn't help shake the feeling it had a bit of a 50s diner vibe from the booths and tables and how they looked, but I know it's a French restaurant. The tables settings were well arranged, and when they saw it was a party of two, the promptly removed the extra setting. They have a small, but decent wine selection; their Chardonnay was pretty good, and I would recommend it to others. For appetizers, I had their oysters of the day, which I cannot recall the exact name. They were small, but very good, and no complaints. For dinner, I had the Duck Confit and spinach, both of which were excellent. The spinach was really good, and had the exact amount of seasoning. It wasn't complex, but it still tasted great. The duck was good too, and I liked that it was not dry. The vegetables in the dish were terrific and they went great together, and with the seasoning. For dessert, my guest and I split the Creme Brulee, which was decent, but nothing impressive. Two appetizers, two glasses of wine, two entrees, and one dessert went for $140, so it's a bit on the pricey side. It was good food, but tough to justify the high price. The food is excellent, but just doesn't have that kind of WOW factor to take it over the edge, and make it 5 stars. I think Brasserie needs to be a bit more modest, and recognize they are not in NYC, and to reconsider their pricing. They may also want to keep in mind, that while they may not have a lot of competitors, the ones they do have been around for ALOT longer (Casa Milanese, Shadows, even Bull and Buddha, though I do like Brasserie better than Bull and Buddha). They may get the curious foodie, but odds are, if they are local, they might migrate back to their familiar eateries rather than fork over $140 for two.
Ok, I don't take the time to do this often, but this place was awesome!  Can't imagine a better place in Poughkeepsie
I've been here a million times. Service is always prompt, attentive and knowledgeable . Food is so consistent, and delicious every time. Menu is just a tad different every time I go. Great commitment to local fare. All in all, I've never had a bad experience here and it's the first place I recommend to someone asking about where to eat in Poughkeepsie.
Absolutely horrible service Béarnaise sauce was watery Aioli sauce was watery Pommes frites (glorified french fries) were the side dish for all entrees pretty much and they were too wimpy to hold up the sauce Where's the salad and/or vegetables? For a French restaurant , very chintzy with the butter. The herb butter on my friend's steak wouldn't even melt because the steak was cold They brought appetizer after dinner They brought the wife's drink without bringing the husbands
A pretty place with a nice menu and acceptable, not very attentive service, but the kitchen and the portions have a way to go. The chicken club was tiny little pieces of meat tooth picked together on bread that fell apart when raised to the mouth. The salmon on a bed of greens was small dry and somewhat tasteless. Wine portions were meager. Architecturally, the place is a gem. Their heart is in the right place, but I'm not so sure about the chef.
Returned to Brasserie 292 yet again and, as usual, had a great experience.  If you haven't been here for Sunday brunch you don't know what you're missing!  Not only do you get to enjoy the consistent high level of service and the great surroundings, you get to feast on an imaginative array of menu selections.  This is not your typical brunch fare!  Always a refreshing twist on food and, of course, drink.  Enjoy!
Ok so after Gaslight Brassiere in Boston, its been a struggle to find a place that stands up to such greatness. I must admit, I am more at about 3.5 stars with B292, but yelp is a fan of whole numbers so I was forced to round down. I ordered the spinach salad with bacon vinaigrette to start. (sigh) this was a bit of a disappointment, although large enough to share, I wasn't the biggest of fans. Call me cray, I guess I assumed a bacon dressing might contain...bacon! Instead I got  bacon essence , so most likely just bacon fat, but not even so much as a matchstick of actual bacon IN the salad. I found it way over dressed, so there was just so much of that I could take. Ricotta was nice, but basic, and the shallots to my knowledge may have been pickled, so nice but ehhhh..idk I definitely wouldn't be ordering that again...bacon lardons and less dressing, we got a deal. The bread was quite lackluster and I know I know, its bread, chill out. But a $110 bill sans alcohol...I expect the bread to be stellar, and hello we are talking french cuisine, so bread, is a big deal. I ordered the short rib with creamed Kale, and sweet potato crisps...sooo good. The creamed kale was insane, the short rib, super tender and juicy, and the sauce had a warm hint to it...cinnamon? My husband ordered a burger (hes a daring lad I tell ya) which I nabbed a bite from, and found quite tasty as well. So the desserts, this ones tough because if you read my reviews you know how hard I am to please in this department. The chocolate gelato was definitely not held at the proper temperature, so speckled with ice crystals...$9... uh no. The pear tartin should probably be served with a side of insulin..holy crap was that overly sweet! Overall, it was good, my entree was fantastic and I am still very curious as to what the rest of the menu has to offer. I'm a french onion soup junkie and could have kicked myself for choosing the bacon fat salad, but hey C'est la vie (see what I did there...french..no?) In the end, I'd give it another shot, the service was great, entree's good...beware of the salads...and skip the dessert, but definitely give em a shot!
Came twice for brunch. Overall the selection is good and staff is professional. So far, the food is average. Both times I ordered egg dishes, omelette and scramble. In both cases, they were overdone. Also tried the blue point oysters (1$/ea during Sunday brunch), they were better than at other places in the area. I will go back and try some else.
Drinks and food terrific.  Front of house needs work in the overall customer service  area (being able to identify what the customer is feeling, thinking). Overall a real gem.
Worst experience of my life. Not only did the server roll her eyes at us (mind you we were a party of 8 that was an auto grat) but they tried to charge us $58 dollars to put a piece of pie on a plate. They never mentioned a charge and they offered to warm it up but never did. They charged is $18 for a tablespoon of melted ice cream all over the plate and when we asked the server of the charge she said it was the policy. It took us 30 minutes to be able to speak to a manager and when he did he treated us like children. He removed the bill and the charge then literally threw it at our table and walked away. Terrible customer service and I have never been treated that way in my life. Do not go here unless you want to be over charged and eat food that is new York city prices in the middle of Poughkeepsie but not near the quality. I will never return and will only say bad things of this place.
I was here a couple of weeks ago, just after they opened.  In short, the place is great. They were packed when we got there, but the staff were very efficient in greeting us, getting us a drink at the bar, and then seating us within about 10-15 minutes.   You can see the Bar Americain and Balthazar influences here.  The menu is french-leaning brasserie, but very accessible and reasonably priced.  We started with HV fois gras and banana bread because it seemed like such a unique combination for the area and I wanted to see if they pulled it off; they did.   For dinner, we ordered a steak and mussels.  Both were very good, but I have to say that I am very glad I ordered the mussels for myself.  The broth was excellent. Besides good service and good food, the ambiance is exactly what you would want to see in a newly launched place-- nice decor, customers buzzing, and altogether a fun energy. Absolutely recommended.
By the time we got to Poughkeepsie, we may have eaten anywhere. We were starving after a long drive . I had no idea what to expect and felt we must have misunderstood the hotel receptionist as he told us to check out Main Street Poughkeepsie, which was not at all what we expected... seemed like a downtown where all the businesses had fled and just a tired, kinda boarded up place with some cool architecture. I was not feeling too optimistic about finding a decent place to eat . We ended up asking a young man on the street  who had recently moved from Manhattan and he recommended this place.   And it turned out to be excellent, like a San Francisco restaurant but with friendly servers.  Ok, just kidding but the serving staff did seem exceptionally young, attractive and friendly. Bread and drinks came fast, and I thought the bread was excellent. I ordered the steak poivre and it was so big that there was no way I could finish it. The meat was tender and the sauce peppery and buttery. My BF had the lone chicken dish and ate every bit. He wasn't initially thrilled with the menu but ended up liking his food a lot. Although I don't anticipate getting to Poughkeepsie again anytime soon, I would definitely go here again if I had the chance.
Husband and I ate here for restaurant week and were very impressed. Excellent food and service! Can't wait to go back!
This is definitely my favorite place to go in Poughkeepsie. I love the atmosphere and the energy mostly, but the food can be really excellent as well. I recommend the Steak Tartar. All I can say about it is, "WOW"
I was looking for a great dinner in a casual atmosphere and, not to be insulting, Poughkeepsie is not awash in great restaurants. I took my 3 teens here after a long day at Mohonk and we had a fabulous experience. First, the service was great--very friendly and attentive. It was late on a weeknight, so the place was less than 1/2 full, but the vibe was still very upbeat. We started with half a dozen oysters and a half dozen clams, and they were perfectly briny and fresh. We also had onion soup and the pommes frittes, which were just right. I had the cod entree, which was cooked perfectly. The kids each had a different plate of steak--steak au poivre, tri-tip and the strip--and they were perfectly medium-rare. We had the nutella hot chocolate and the chocolate cake with 3 kinds of ice cream. Great cup of coffee ended a fantastic meal, and I thought the bill was totally fair. Would definitely come back on the off chance of another trip through town.
As I begin to write this review, I reminded myself not to rate it until something within this write up tells me what is a rightful rating.   Walking into Brasserie I felt as I have once before experienced this.  There was a dinning room filled with people that all shared a common smile.  The wait staff was very professional and they as a team worked well with one another.  Not for one moment did I feel neglected.  The menu was simple enough to understand yet stood as a heavy weight.  A nice line-up for what every your palate craves. Portions were just the right, and they didn't overload us with bread, which I might add, "had you asking for more".  A nice job on the beer selections, but sometimes I like enjoy a familiar face.  I am not going to bore you with what I ate, or suggest for you anything that enjoyed.  Notice I said "enjoyed".  Enjoyed is exactly what I did.  I enjoyed my experience. The restrooms were out of sight.  If you can't appreciate that you will not appreciate this review, (click the back arrow now).  Not only were they out of sight they were "out a sight".  one at a time bathrooms, are good because I like my space.   I didn't like the desserts.  OK, I can eat, and I can eat desserts too. As a matter of fact, I just killed a cookie! 5 star cookie (my daughter made them) I love CC cookies that have a little bit of a saltness to them.  Sorry A.D.D. moment. NYC has a Balthazar, and when I dared to ask if they were the same owners, the staff answered "no".   I do not know if the standard layout for a "Brasserie" is that of which Brasserie 292 and Balthazar share, so I will leave it at that.   As for pricing... who gives a shit...It was enjoyed I wish I didn't order dessert
The fried oysters are the best I have ever had ANYWHERE! Yes ANYWHERE! It is impossible ti share them. Perfectly cooked a must have. The red pepper relish compliments the oysters without over powering their delicate flavor. I want them now, my month is watering thinking about them.
Ok, I don't take the time to do this often, but this place was awesome!  Can't imagine a better place in Poughkeepsie
Given a small sampling of friends who had visited this relatively new downtown Poughkeepsie restaurant, I heard mixed reviews.  However, our visit on a bustling Saturday evening was very positive all around.  First, they were very accommodating when I needed to change the time of our reservation and when we showed up even earlier than planned there was no problem.  The décor is crisply authentic of a typical French brasserie in a modern repro sort of way--tiles walls, banquettes, bentwood chairs at other tables, lots of bustle and liveliness.  The starters we tried, fried oysters in a sort of light chopped salsa and the chevre and beet arugula salads were excellent, so to were the mussels (cooked in a slightly smokey cream broth) and the duck confit which was very tender and smothered in a wild mushroom and cream sauce that was redolent and flavorful. A cone of the frites on the side was more than enough for two.  Desserts ran the gamut from sinful to virtuous.  We shared a selection of homemade ice creams, the perfect finishing touch.  Service was generally good but one needed to attract attention in most cases when things got busy.  Brasserie 292 has some good momentum going for them at the moment.  Keep it up!  Poughkeepsie deserves a restaurant of this kind of ambition. Postscript: Returned in October of 2012.  Here are a few observations.  The service continues to be eager to please and when something went very wrong with my martini order --twice-- they struggled to get it right.  The menu has been revised and has a number of excellent dishes including a new piquante broth for the mussels and a tasty although improbable appetizer combination of Fried Oysters laid over bits of steak tartare.  In our party the only losing bet was their too greasy rendition of the strozzopreti  with sausage and black Tuscan kale.  Otherwise, Brasserie 292 is trying to maintain their earlier high standards.

The closest thing the Hudson Valley has to a "New York" brasserie. One of the best kitchens in the area. On my Hudson Valley Top 10 list.

Really good food but, it wasn't very busy our service was a bit lacking. I loved the Ommegang Abbey Ale. It's definitely a new favorite beer.

Casual, classy atmosphere.  Food was delicious-mushroom soup, pork shank, and bass with sea scallops. Service was attentive & informative.  We were treated to a complimentary dessert for our anniversary!  The cocktails were wonderful too.  We plan to return the next time we're in P'town.

Went out last night and visited Brasserie 292 for the first time. My friend and I have been talking about it for a while now, and I happened upon a pre-fix offering that we couldn't pass up! When we walked in the door it was a happening bustling place. Right off the bat we were welcomed by a very charming young man who took our name and was very personable. We were sat in a back corner, which I love because we could watch everything. The waitress was friendly and informative with all our questions. We started with the fried oysters and warm camembert, which just let me say OH MY. So good. The reason why I will drag my husband there! My girlfriend had the Monkfish and I had the braised Pork shank. Both equally delish. Finished the meal off some brilliant desserts and strong coffee, which is loved by us girls. Bottom line, if your in Poughkeepsie and you are hungry and wan't amazing food, service and atmosphere visit Brasserie 292, you will not be disappointed!!!
Brasserie 292 is very nicely decorated and comfortable inside.  It is a little expensive, but as long as you are prepared for that, it is a good option for dining in Poughkeepsie.   I had the strozzapreti with sausage, kale, and squash and it was delicious.  The sausage was amazing and the pasta was very good.
Hippo loves me some Brassiere 292!!!!!! 6 stars
This wasn't our first time here. Brasserie 292 is wonderful restaurant with an unusual  menu, great food and a friendly staff. We tried the scallops with pork belly and were  very pleasently surprised. The mussels were delicious and the steaks were cooked pertectly. Our server Ali was a delight!  Would recommend Brasserie 292 to anyone.
Everything you taste here is superb.  Service is impeccable.  The atmosphere and decor is perfect.  Love the marble topped bar and tiled everything.  I like the raw bar, oysters and cherry stones.  Not many places in the area serve it to this quality so when I get the urge for oysters I go here.  On the pricey side but you get what you pay for.

Had a very nice lunch here for a friend's birthday.  Had steak frite and it was pretty good.  Coffee was good and desert i remember being delicious.  I didn't have wine, but I would like to return to check out the wine list.

When it first opened, I thought this place was amazing but more recently the quality seems to have declined a bit. The dishes are now just so-so.

I'm a reluctant transplant from Manhattan, and Brasserie 292 is a saving grace. As good as the best NYC restaurants, I've never had anything other than a superb meal here. Ambiance, service, decor, and drinks are all top notch as well. I hope it stays as long as I do.

Delicious brunch, amazingly fresh and great oysters, Croque Madam was flawless also Pain Perdue crusted with almonds and served with creme anglaise and pure maple syrup. Great service!

We loved this place after our first meal; felt we were in Paris with the decor and menu. We shared a good salad and the steak frites and the number of fries was enormous; the sauteed spinach tasted off, however, not sure why. AND the bread came hard and cold though the butter was sweet and delicious. We also shared a great glass of Pinot Noir. And next time we'll save room for dessert-they craft their own ice creams with flavorings and all sounded delicious as did the profiteroles we spied at another table. The neighborhood is sketchy so park nearby and there's another great place on the street--Artist Palette. This is a great addition to the hood and we hope the chef can get better bread and serve it warm! But that's minor. We'll return and give it a fifth star! Second visit, Sept. 14th We went back for a second visit and have some additional comments, some a bit more critical and ready to knock off a star. The special first course of lobster was incredibly tasteless and overpriced for the little bit of meat; the tomatoes quite hard and the dressing nonexistent, no taste whatsoever! The second course we had of tender tasty short ribs was great and the waiter kindly substituted pomme frites for mashed potatoes. Have something better please than escarole as a vegetable, also tasteless. the big disappointment of the night was the ice cream sandwich, which after much fanfare and a long description was a big nothing--two mediocre cookies--almost hard, and dabs of ice cream--almost invisible with a garnish of a few berries; quite underwhelming. Finally, the bread is served cold though with great butter. We will keep coiming back but the restaurant can be much better if it improves certain courses. We still love the atmopshere and the staff is terrific-helpful and friendly...and the manager came by twice to ask how all was; we lied since not his fault. A lively bar scene and we hope it survives in a sort of dismal part of Poughkeepsie, though Artist Palette across the street is also wonderful.

I went there for a lady's night with the the girls from work. It was an amazing night. They don't have much for a vegan, which is totally expected for a french restaurant, but I made it work with an app of roasted beet salad sans cheese, which was literally the best salad I've ever had. For an entree I got a pasta, which he said was dried and I believed him, tagliatelle with mushrooms. It was okay, but it probably would have had more flavor with dairy, but whatcha gonna do...My friends had moules frite, steak tartar for apps and bunch of other things, they said it was all amazing. Proseco was delicious as were a few bottles of white. They enjoyed dessert while I had more Proseco, vegan dessert at its finest. The service was really good considering they were slammed, and it was a Thursday night during Restaurant Week. It was worth a day's pay for an awesome evening.

By far best meal and service we have had in the Hudson Valley in a long long time. Job well done!
Delicious brunch, amazingly fresh and great oysters, Croque Madam was flawless also Pain Perdue crusted with almonds and served with creme anglaise and pure maple syrup. Great service!
LOVE.  I'm partial to the Poughkeepsie area for a reason that I can't even define, and I wish it many more restaurants of this variety and quality.  It's damn cute, they make a mean Manhattan (which says something about the skill and character of the bartender and restaurant!), and everything was delicious.  The owner told me he can't get his exec to work Saturday mornings, and, thus, they aren't opened for brunch on Saturdays and don't foresee it happening.  This is the kind of restaurant God invented brunch for, and I can't wait until Sunday.  I have witheld a star in bitterness and protest for Saturday brunch!
Outstanding food and superior wait staff. Everyone was very friendly and attentive. We will definitely be back!  The owner was friendly and knows how to run a class operation. Cod was the best I've had in years!
Brasserie 292 was a big surprise to me.  It's very hip and cool with great service.  Our waitress for Sunday brunch was very helpful and sweet and gave great suggestions.  I had what has to be the finest fried chicken and waffles I have ever tasted.  My partner had what sounds ordinary a cheeseburger but this was no ordinary cheeseburger.  Had to be amongst the best cheeseburgers I have tried.  Every detail has clearly been thought out.  Homemade ketchup, Homemade delicate vinaigrette dressing for the salad,  wonderful coating for the chicken.  Really try this place out.

And next time we'll save room for dessert-they craft their own ice creams with flavorings and all sounded delicious as did the profiteroles we spied at another table. The neighborhood is sketchy so park nearby and there's another great place on the street--Artist Palette. This is a great addition to the hood and we hope the chef can get better bread and serve it warm! But that's minor. We'll return and give it a fifth star! Second visit, Sept. 14th We went back for a second visit and have some additional comments, some a bit more critical and ready to knock off a star. The special first course of lobster was incredibly tasteless and overpriced for the little bit of meat; the tomatoes quite hard and the dressing nonexistent, no taste whatsoever! The second course we had of tender tasty short ribs was great and the waiter kindly substituted pomme frites for mashed potatoes. Have something better please than escarole as a vegetable, also tasteless. the big disappointment of the night was the ice cream sandwich, which after much fanfare and a long description was a big nothing--two mediocre cookies--almost hard, and dabs of ice cream--almost invisible with a garnish of a few berries; quite underwhelming. Finally, the bread is served cold though with great butter. We will keep coiming back but the restaurant can be much better if it improves certain courses. We still love the atmopshere and the staff is terrific-helpful and friendly...and the manager came by twice to ask how all was; we lied since not his fault. A lively bar scene and we hope it survives in a sort of dismal part of Poughkeepsie, though Artist Palette across the street is also wonderful.
Dinner 4/5/14 and this time a disappointment.  Someone in the kitchen is playing around, messing up classic French recipes.  The escargots  were smothered with breadcrumbs. That's  a no-no. Garlic butter only, please.  Also, the dish was luke warm, it should be sizzling.  The mussels, too, were luke warm, although the cream sauce below was very hot.  Mussels with smoked  bacon lardons doesn't work - mussels flavor is very delicate and the lardons made the dish unpleasant.  Also, the broth was overly creamy.  Seems to me it's a classic case of an inexperienced chef playing around.  Skinny fries with mussels were a good touch, but they too lwere luke warm and soggy.  Garlic mayonnaise dip was excellent. My guest's salmon was excellent, bread was wonderful, young female server very competent.  We were in the side room, extremely noisy, a large table of very loud and annoying young men alongside.  Don't know if I'll return, seems classic Brasserie is morphing into Noo Yawk basic.  Someone should take a look.
I went there for a lady's night with the the girls from work. It was an amazing night. They don't have much for a vegan, which is totally expected for a french restaurant, but I made it work with an app of roasted beet salad sans cheese, which was literally the best salad I've ever had. For an entree I got a pasta, which he said was dried and I believed him, tagliatelle with mushrooms. It was okay, but it probably would have had more flavor with dairy, but whatcha gonna do...My friends had moules frite, steak tartar for apps and bunch of other things, they said it was all amazing. Proseco was delicious as were a few bottles of white. They enjoyed dessert while I had more Proseco, vegan dessert at its finest. The service was really good considering they were slammed, and it was a Thursday night during Restaurant Week. It was worth a day's pay for an awesome evening.
Great food, simply amazing! I ordered the french onion soup to start and had the pork belly and scallops as my main dish, then shared a chocolate pot de creme with my hubby for dessert. Having traveled to France several times in the last few years and eaten in my share of bistros, I was transported by the atmosphere and terrific food. This is a gem for Poughkeepsie and I'd dine here frequently were I to live close-by.
By far best meal and service we have had in the Hudson Valley in a long long time. Job well done!
This place is a find, for sure. The ambience is really cool -- looks like a Paris train station -- and the food is a tasty take on brasserie fare. My husband had the agnolloti, stuffed with mushrooms, and I had the crispy pork belly over polenta; both were excellent. We split their delicious box of doughnuts for dessert, which were enough for four people not just two. After having an utterly mediocre meal at The Artist's Palette across the street, we went back here for dessert another night and had the ice cream sandwich. The cookie could be a bit less hard, but loved the idea of two homemade cookies filled with your choice of gelato.  All in all, a pleasurable experience.
LOVE.  I'm partial to the Poughkeepsie area for a reason that I can't even define, and I wish it many more restaurants of this variety and quality.  It's damn cute, they make a mean Manhattan (which says something about the skill and character of the bartender and restaurant!), and everything was delicious.  The owner told me he can't get his exec to work Saturday mornings, and, thus, they aren't opened for brunch on Saturdays and don't foresee it happening.  This is the kind of restaurant God invented brunch for, and I can't wait until Sunday.  I have witheld a star in bitterness and protest for Saturday brunch!
Really hit or miss. Like all expensive restaurants in that area either I have a perfect time or my Girlfriend does.  but the big thing about 292 is that EVERYTIME I have ordered a Manhattan up I get it on the rocks. it is infuriating
Brasserie 292 was a big surprise to me.  It's very hip and cool with great service.  Our waitress for Sunday brunch was very helpful and sweet and gave great suggestions.  I had what has to be the finest fried chicken and waffles I have ever tasted.  My partner had what sounds ordinary a cheeseburger but this was no ordinary cheeseburger.  Had to be amongst the best cheeseburgers I have tried.  Every detail has clearly been thought out.  Homemade ketchup, Homemade delicate vinaigrette dressing for the salad,  wonderful coating for the chicken.  Really try this place out.
Went to Brasserie 292 with my husband on a Friday night before a show at the Civic Center.  We were fortunate to get a seat at the bar, as we had gambled on heading in there with no reservation.  We sat down right before the evening rush came in.  The bartender was very friendly and provided insight on the beers on tap.  We couldn't quite decide on what to order for our entree but placed an order for some appetizers.  As our appetizers arrived, the place really started to get busy.  It took a very long time between when our appetizers arrived and when we were finally able to order our entree, which we had to place with the manager because the bartender became so busy.  There was only one person to serve drinks for the bar and the entire restaurant on a Friday night!  We ended up ordering the burgers because they sounded so yummy, but when I ordered mine well done I was told "Well if you're in a rush I wouldn't order that" which is not what a diner really wants to hear.  That's what I wanted so that's what I ordered!  When our burgers did arrive, we had about 15 minutes to eat until we needed to get to our show so we shoved the burgers and "hand-cut" fries (which did not look hand-cut to me) down our throats.  The burgers were quite well done.  Overall, my recommendation is to not sit at the bar on a Friday evening when there is only one bartender to service the entire restaurant unless you have some time on your hands and can sit back and relax and wait.

Overall this was a very nice, sophisticated restaurant. The waitstaff was excellent and attentive. I would have given it 5-stars, except for the price (maybe sometime in the future, as we will be back). They have two separate rooms, one for smaller groups (2-4 people/table) and a separate long room, that can be set up for larger parties. We were in the long room,as we had a party of 7. They specialize in different types of oyster for starters, which were nice presented on beds ot ice with lemon and two different types of cocktail sauce. They were large and very fresh. The spinach salad with the hot vinaigrette was excellent,as well as the risotto (it was definitely done "to the tooth"). All of our entrees had a well balanced mixture of spices, and were just the right size (not "he-man" portions, but not miniature portions either.) We ahd enough room for dessert, which was a trio of chocolate desserts. Once again, not too large, just the right amount for our table to share.

Lovely decor, loved the varied menu, all food excellent (fish, meat and ribs, as well as steak tartare, even salads), portions ample, service helpful and well paced. Of course our wine by the glass was fine too, and we appreciated sampling before ordering. Only wish we had stayed for dessert but it was late and we were too tired.  Definitely worth going to Brasserie 292!

We always have a great time here.  The service is excellent and the food is always delicious.  We love classic cocktails and Brasserie definitely does too. You can tell that the owners definitely understand the restaurant business and the importance of the "customer experience."   The mussels are my favorite followed by the steak frites.  Desserts are awesome too.

The styling, menu offerings and prices at Brasserie 292 set an expectation for excellence that the restaurant sadly does not live up to. Pros: Service is excellent and food comes out promptly, considering it is made fresh. Wait staff are friendly and courteous and check on you often. Some dishes, like the steak tartare, are excellent. Cons: Food is not up to snuff. The first time I stopped here, I was in the mood for pasta, and was therefore tempted by the special, a pasta dish whose exact composition I no longer remember. What was memorable was how painfully undercooked the pasta was, and how little flavor the sauce had. This was a costly mistake, but it was entirely my fault. You don't order pasta in restaurant like this. On the other hand, a $25 pasta should either be great, or not be served at all. The second trip, I decided to avoid my previous mistake and order to the restaurant's strengths - steak frites. I opted for the au poivre, which, among the sauce choices, carried bizarre $2 surcharge. My father ordered the same, but ordered medium, while I asked for rare. His steak, I should note, was perfect, where mine was at least 30% gristle. The remaining 70% was rare, as ordered, and yet it was the toughest piece of meat I've had in ages. I have a nearly pathological fear of returning food, because I hate confrontation of any kind, but at nearly $30 a plate, this needed to be remedied. I returned the steak, with lots of apologies, and the wait staff was very understanding. The second attempt was a much thinner cut of meat, but the texture was perfect and there was no gristle. HOWEVER, the chef signaled his displeasure at my return by slathering the meat with so much pepper I had to practically chisel through it. It was painful to eat as served. I managed to scrape most of the pepper off, and salvage the meat, but I'm afraid I've learned my lesson. Other reviewers say Brasserie would be right at home in NYC, but the fact is, we have some terrific restaurants in the Hudson Valley - Rhinebeck, Millbrook, the Culinary Institute, etc.. So while the food might be up to NYC standards, it's not up to ours.

The food is fantastic. Friends from NYC discovered this place and brought us as a treat. A treat it was, and we will be going back soon. Prices are high, which usually scares me off, but the experience was worth it. The place has a nice feel. it's stylish, a little cramped but still airy. The staff were all friendly, real and did their jobs well. The reason I'm writing a review though is the food. It's all about taste. We were using bread to soak up the last bits of flavor before our plates were cleared. If you can afford it, you will not be disappointed.

From start to finish an outstanding experience. We were greeted by the friendly staff who made us feel welcome and comfortable.  The food and service were outstanding, and the servers very knowledgeable about the food and wine. The place is spotlessly clean and impeccable managed - you can tell a lot of pride and care goes into what they do. We eat in Brooklyn and Manhattan often and thought if this restaurant was in either of those two places, you'd never be able to get a table.  a++!

Sunday brunch, service was fine.  Omelettes lacked flavor, very bland.  Banana tart was too gooey with a too thick layer of ricotta cream.   I've been here many times for dinner and it was fine but brunch needs a little work.

came here out of town based on recommendation from hotel. nice atmosphere, oysters were very tasty. beet salad barely had enough beets. maybe end of the day the bread was a bit chewy. main issue was i think service is amateurish. we had an allergy but they had very inconsistent check with the chefs (fries are cooked in peanut  oil) and we were told way after we started the meal about things that had nuts in it after we had eaten half the dish. the place was very empty so it is not as if he were that busy. Usually most wait staff are extremely concerned and helpful in that regard. and make us feel comfortable. that did not make us feel like staying for dessert. The yellowfin tuna was tasty, althoguh it was a bit cold, and the scallops were very tasty. entrees are about 26 to 28 $ so it is pricey.

We stopped because it looked inviting from the outside.  The owners have obviously studied Balthazar so you've probably been there before.  The good thing is that they took careful notes and made a very good version.  The menu isn't as broad as you might like but what we ordered was very well prepared.  We left happy Princes of Serendip and recommend it to one and all.
Excellent food, great service and perfect atmosphere.

The area of Main Street close to Market Street continues to grow in culinary options. The recently opened Brasserie 292 is a case in point. Set in a beautifully decorated space with black and white tiled walls and a ceiling painted to resemble copper, the room is magnificent (albeit a bit loud from all of the hard surfaces). The food is truly fantastic: we started with fried oysters, which were the best that I have ever tasted. They were fresh, served in the shell, with a tangy mignonette sauce. We also tried the warm camembert, which was equally good but a little less inspired. From there we moved on to the Roasted Cod with bacon, fingerlings and clams; and the Tagliatelle with asparagus, wild mushrooms and parmigiano. Both entrees were exceptional (although the tagliatelle did not come with the pamigiano, a problem easily rectified). They also have a good selection of wines by the glass, and were happy to bring us a taste of a few varietals that we had never tried. All in all, a great addition to the Poughkeepsie dining scene, and a place that we can't wait to visit again.

We've eaten here twice. Amazing, as good or better than Balthazar, the great bistro in Manhattan mentioned on 30 Rock. Bone Marrow: spectacular. Braised lamb shank: amazing Mussels: great. coq au vin was very good, nice mild, tasty dish. Best restaurant outside of NYC, and as good as most in NYC.

This is a beautiful French restaurant that seems very out of place in an otherwise somewhat depressing, desolate stretch in Poughkeepsie. We arrived to brunch a little early at around 11:30 to a completely empty restaurant. We were able to select a nice private booth in the back at which we were able to feast on a number of items, mostly just average to pretty good: - Pastry Basket ($10) This is always a must to start with at brunch, but this version was not particularly good. It consisted of a plain croissant, almond croissant and a blueberry muffin. The croissants tasted kind of old and the decent muffin was the best of the bunch. - Pommes Frites ($4) Au Cheval (+ $4) These fries were incredible, and by far the best thing we ate here. The pile of hot fries were very crispy and delicious, but the "au cheval" made it even better, adding on Manchego cheese, bacon and a fried egg. The hot, runny mess was so good and the only thing I tried here that I would highly recommend you must try. - Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Cornbread Waffles ($16) This was pretty good, but the dark meat chicken was not particularly good. The cornbread waffles also didn't have much flavor, leaving us slightly disappointed. The skin was the best part, but I wish there was some higher quality breast meat involved. - Braised Short Rib Potato Cake ($16) This was a bit of a mistake, as it just tasted like a typical eggs benedict dish, as it was slathered in the same tasting hollandaise sauce you always expect. The short rib failed to salvage the dish, as it was mostly extremely fatty with few quality pieces to be found. - Box Of Doughnuts with Apple Butter Filling ($8) Moving on to dessert, these large doughnut holes were just ok. The filling was not very sweet and didn't seem worth wasting it on, as they just tasted doughy and didn't have a good crisp texture  like you would have expected. - Walnut Carrot Cake ($8) This dessert was much better on the other hand. It was beautifully arranged with a little cupcake-sized piece of carrot cake along with some refreshing carrot gelato. The cake paired with the gelato was a perfect combo and made for a very sweet, satisfying end to the meal. Get those fries and the carrot cake and you will leave happy. Otherwise, the rest of the stuff we tried was a bit of a letdown.

Such a wonderful experience here.  My husband and I were vacationing in nearby Milton, NY. I read the online reviews and decided to give this place a try.  Downtown Poughkeepsie is struggling and this restaurant is one of the businesses that will help it turn around.  We ordered the lunchtime prix fixe menu... salad, mussels, dessert... and everything was delicious in the classic French tradition. The mussels were offered with cream sauce; but, we asked for tomato-based sauce and were accommodated, which shows you the chef is confident and adaptable.  Our waitress, Karina, was lovely. (Good luck in your new home, Karina).  Highly suggest you give this place a try once or even twice during your stay in upstate New York.

The atmosphere here is like a wonderful vacation. They have got the Parisian Bistro feel down perfectly. There are comfortable red-cushioned booths, a gorgeous tin ceiling and black and white check floors.  The menu offers some traditional French favorites, as well as some creative items based on local, fresh ingredients.  They always have a fresh fish dish and offer oysters in season. The salads are loaded with a variety of fresh greens or you can try something different, like a beet salad. The desserts are delicious, as well as pretty to look at.  I particularly enjoy the Sunday Brunch menu because of the fresh pastry baskets, omelets and the live jazz ensemble. There is a full bar with seating. The atmosphere is relaxing and not formal.  It's very good for couples or a group of friends.

We had never been here before but we're looking for a nice place to go for parents weekend at Marist. We took our daughter and her friends here for dinner. It was their first nice dinner since being at Marist for a month. The food was excellent and the service was superb. Our water glasses were always full, and the dinner was paced nicely. We would definitely come back again.
Amazing cuisine in the hometown of the Culinary Institute. We were wowed one dish after the next! Cocktails were very good as well. Wait staff were great. Inside, the restaurant reminded me of the classic, early 20th century style interiors that I love in New York City, but likely harkened back to a much classier time of Poughkeepsie.

When we stopped into this restaurant we didn't realize they were not open for an hour between lunch and dinner because it didn't say so on google, but they served us anyway. I got the steak frites (steak and fries). My steak was very nicely prepared at medium and I got a hearty helping of show string fries on the side. I plan on returning for more seafood items because I've heard very good things about their menu.

I was hardcore craving a good juicy burger for lunch, and after researching Yelp for the closest open place to go near work, settled on the Brasserie. I had been there for dinner but not lunch so my coworker and I got a couple burgers to go. I got my burger medium rare with blue cheese and she ordered hers with guyere and medium. Both burgers were cooked perfectly. I couldn't believe it when I got back to work and took a bite! It was burger love at first bite! Pomme frites were delish as well and not too soggy for being in a to go container. Highly recommend their burger for lunch and can't wait to get one next week!!

While the service & ambiance is excellent, the food leaves a lot to be desired. Nothing stood out to me and the steak my husband ordered was pretty bland. I wouldn't go as far as to say that I'd NEVER come back...but I believe there are better options in the area. Side note - the area is shady!! I'd be weary of walking around here at night.

Came here expecting a nice meal while we were on a weekend getaway from the city.  We ordered the short rib special with Mac and cheese and the crab tortelloni. The short rib was very fatty and the Mac and cheese tasted like a bad easy Mac. The tortelloni was on top of mashed up pees (baby food like consistency) and tasted watery. We were very unsatisfied with the meal.

I ate here last summer for lunch for a girls afternoon with my very foodie daughters. I'm still reminded of how wonderful that afternoon was between the superb food and good service and of course my delightful company even a year later. It was so good and such a surprise I took my husband there for dinner the following night. The best thing I had was the Steak Tartare. It's a dish when done right makes me happy to be a voracious carnivore. And yes they do it right here. Then let me praise their house special mixed drinks. A lovely list. Do try them and try them all. Can we say designated driver wanted!

As a group of seven, we all loved our meals! Thank goodness we were all in the mood to share as the menu was extensively intriguing and hard to pick just one. Some of our group opted for the tasty Prix Fixe Lunch menu, reasonably priced at $22, and others picked from the regular menu. Do have an appetizer or two, you won't be upset. Most all us in the group are Chefs and know that an amazing appetizers only meant "the best is yet to come". Do have some escargot and the wedge salad for sure. They make the best escargot I've had so far. Entrees were just as good if not better. I and two others had the succulent pan roasted cod that was resting in the middle of a magical pool of lobster cream chowder with charred corn, bacon lardons, sliced potato, cherry tomato, and cockles. Man if that doesn't make you excited you should check your pulse! The broth and some crusty bread, heaven. Found myself with a little dessert envy as two at our table ordered the caramelized banana tart with ricotta cream and banana gelato. Service was both prompt and polite. The building it's self is beautiful with classic tin tiles in the ceiling and is accented nice by the giant mirrors in the walls. The menu is not super kid friendly and there isn't a clear vegan section, nevertheless  we were all ecstatic about everything we ordered we will be back again for sure!

I went to Brasserie for Valentines day dinner. I think we had a fantastic dining experience. First of all the atmosphere was right for the mood and stuff, and the waitress, was very attentive. We ordered Fried oysters with celery root remoulade, and pepper relish as a side. The oysters were slightly fishy, seems like frozen, but I hope I was wrong. each fried oysters, they put like a candied salted lemon skin, and it actually works very well with the remoullade and the oyster. The pepper relish is also a good pair for the app, very fresh, lemony, pepperish.. after that she ordered Foie gras and some sort of cheese raviolli. I think the dish of herself is good, creamy, savory and the pasta is perfectly cook. my entree was a seared black bass, with scallops and sot of assorted tomato broth (sorry i forgot!), and my bass was perfectly cooked, crispy skin, seasoned beautifully, and the scallop is also very tender. for dessert, she got cheesecake, and I got the nuttela hot chocolate. Both desserts are awesome, but my dessert was better (sorry! :D hahah). anyway, it was a good dining experience :)

We have dined here four times in two weeks and it gets better with each visit. We love the ambiance, the decor, the pleasant music, the top-end service, the cocktails [they do not but should carry Beefeasters Gin] and most of all the food.  Have yet to taste any dish that is not superlative. We will continue as patrons.

Stuck in Poughkeepsie for a fourth night!  I returned to Brasserie for second time.  I had paella and it was excellent.  There was a completely different staff and they were equally great.  I can't understand why this place isn't FULL of Poughkeepsians!

I honestly dont know what people see in this place. I have ate here twice and it was during lunch so that might be why. It's way over priced for what you get. The first time I ate here I got some kind of Chicken sandwich that was dry and bland. The second time I tried it I got the "lobster bisque soup". I put it in quotes because it was literally oily tomato soup the a small chunk of lobster in the middle. Maybe its just the lunches are bad.

I've eaten here 3 times and it's my new favorite spot in Poughkeepsie. The food is delicious and portions are really good.  It's not one of those restaurants where you get a delectable but microscopic portion on your plate. LOVE the duck.  Double love the hot chocolate and nutella! The staff is very attention and well-trained, though still a little green.  Some of them are slightly hovery.  It's a great spot for a romantic meal or a chat because you can actually hear yourself! All in all, if you like gourmet fare and are happy to pay for it, this is your kind of place. Highly recommended.

I went there during Poughkeepsie's Restaurant Week.  I had the shaved vegetable salad, onion soup and salmon.  I'd say go anytime!

Descent French restaurant considering the area.  Service was good. Wanted to rate them a 3.5 but can't figure it out.  Definitely not a 4/5? Service was good. Parking was tricky.

Generous portions, homemade ketchup, amazing French breads and brioche buns, but it was the excellent lump crab salad that really turned my head.  There is talent in the kitchen with details like chive dressing and mixology behind the bar.  In the end you can't go wrong either, the insanely tasteful caramelized banana tart with banana gelato or the make your own ice cream sandwich with various sandwich options and gelato interiors is a great ending! Parking is dicey as the economy has hit this town like a bomb went off and as a result its wrought with hand out beggars and vagrants so street parking doesn't create a draw to say the least...

This place is INCREDIBLE. The food is phenomenal and the service is exceptional. I enjoyed a really great dinner last night with 3 fellow chef friends and we all were just blown away by how good this place was. Max was our server and he was very attentive and knowledgable of the menu. We enjoyed escargot and beef tartar...the best beef tartar I've ever had. The beet salad was so fresh and flavorful and we shared one of the best carrot cakes we've ever had...(and I'm a pastry chef myself). I've been to many restaurants and this place is a prime example of a restaurant done right. Perfect portions, reasonable pricing, great staff and nice ambience all add up to a solid 5 star rating. Keep up the outstanding work! I will be back again!

I would never go back to Brasserie 292 since I got the feeling that they do not care for people who come from out of town and they care for locals more.  My waitress never asked me how the good was and it was hard to find her when I needed more water.  I had to ask others for more water.   The salad and doughnuts for dessert was very good.  I saw baked Escargots on the menu and I ordered them and they were a big disappointment.  They had no flavor to them unlike the excellent ones I had in Paris last September.   I grew up eating them and I know how they should taste.   I did not like the area the restaurant was in and I would not feel safe at night when it is dark outside.  I would not waste my time coming here when I cone back to Hyde Park. I went here May 17, 2014 for dinner.

You know that feeling that a business try's too hard?  You get that at Brasserie. The food selection, wine list, and beer on tap are great! They don't sport your standard bud, coors, miller, but rather cater to a higher quality pallet. The food isn't the issue, it's the over attempt at presentation. The butter comes in a small ramekin with a wax paper film of a B 292 print on it. This is one of a couple observations of the attempt to be high scale. I think the best restaurants, and the most upscale restaurants, aren't that way because of quirky gimmicks like this, but because their food is par none. Speaking of the food...I came in looking for a great steak, so I ordered their highly acclaimed steak frites. I don't know if you have been to a steak house, but the steak speaks for itself. This was paired with a side of French fries. Not the steak house I was hoping for. I'll try something else next time.

A Classy, chic joint like this in upstate NY is quite a treat. When I find my way to Po-town again ill make it a point to return. Pros: -Food was fabulous, easily a 9 out of 10. -Great wine selection and niche mix drinks. -dim lighting and great atmosphere Cons: -Service kind of sucked. Took 15 minutes to get bottle of wine and waitress was forgetful and inattentive. -tables were incredibly small.

This is one of our favorite spots in Poughkeepsie.  We've been here probably a dozen times and have never been disappointed with the food or service.  Highly recommended. The mussels are amazing.  And the bartender makes a mean Manhattan.

Great atmosphere, I've gotten steak both times I've been here and it was cooked perfectly both times.

The food was pretty good and the service was excellent. If I ever go back to Poughkeepsie I would go back for sure. The only negative comment is that I ordered steak au poivre and I did not like the sauce. There was too much of it and killed the flavor of the meat. All in all a good meal.

Had a really nice time here last Sat. First time in Poughkeepsie for a show at the Chance and this was conveniently located a block or so away. Sat at the bar and had a great, personable bartender. Prices are pretty reasonable and it's got the French feel down pat. Decided to go with wine and she let me try one I'd never heard of and friend got a 20 oz draft. Lots of interesting cocktails but not this time. We split lobster risotto, fried oysters (could have been a bit crisper) and an excellent special of grilled asparagus w/ prosciutto and poached egg. A great caramelized banana tart for dessert and we left happy.

Excellent. Baked Camembert with figs, amazing escargot with lots of bread, duck confit, homemade pumpkin ravioli, wild mushroom ragouts, pots of chocolate, cider spiced gelato.... we tried it all. All was absolutely delicious. Service was professional and polished while being very friendly and welcoming. Hard to believe this is in Poughkeepsie. The interior is done so well. Gorgeous marble bar, wooden bistro tables. My new fave- can you tell? We will be back often.

Had brunch there, the chicken and waffles were amazing my husband had the short rib had which was good. The brunch cocktails were delicious. We had the banana dessert which was okay I think the Pot de creme would've been better but will order it next time and see.  overall excellent experience waiting to go back again.

5 stars for the food. I do NOT know why they can't get together a staff that can move their feet a little faster. SLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW service. Huge huge bluepoints, these things are on steroids. Fantastic braised short ribs with an interesting and very tasty side which I THINK was corn and sweet potato, done like a risotto - creamy and slightly al dente at the same time. I should have paid more attention at the time to what it was, I didn't expect to like it but it turned out to be unexpectedly delicious. Dinner companion had the foie gras and goat cheese ravioli which she said was very good but the presentation and portion was sad. Since my last review I've tried several of their desserts, the pot de creme with salted caramel is so decadently rich it's actually almost too much even for two people, despite being a fairly small ramekin of the stuff. If you like chocolate, you'll LOVE this. Buttermilk spiced Panna Cotta was deemed by three people at the table to be the best they've ever had. The surprise of the evening, however, was the Caramelized Banana Tart. This would NEVER be my first choice, but a companion tried it and shared - it's TERRIFIC. Bananas and cinnamon, smooth cream, rich and flavourful but not too sweet, very very good. Can't stop going back, but we really do need to plan ahead when we go to make sure there's nothing else scheduled for the evening, since it's clear dinner will take all night. Sigh. Nothing is perfect, is it?

Wow. How is this place all the way up in Poughkeepsie again? Brasserie 292 would be right at home anywhere in NYC - this is a very pleasant surprise. A damn-near impeccable, classy establishment, it pulls off a mysterious trick of being chic, refined and deceptively large - and yet intimate, inviting and casual all at the same time. And the food is divine. I had escargot followed by duck confit and was quietly blown away. Fancy stuff, technique-driven, certainly - but with finesse satisfyingly downplayed: these are large plates, and you may burst before you leave. This rang especially true of dessert. Don't fret about it being a tiny little tapas portion, everything they do is easily enough for two people to share. We failed miserably at splitting three profiteroles. Not mega-cheap (two courses each plus shared dessert plus a glass of wine plus a glass of beer plus tip = about $100) but well worth it. Bonus points for the most well-mannered, knowledgeable and pleasant servers I think I've ever encountered in the Hudson Valley, and for the presence on the menu of those glorious magic words "seasonal craft beers on tap". Highly recommended, especially good for dates.

I really love this restaurant. I have been there twice and I can't complain about the food at all. The first time I went I had a delicious bourbon cocktail, the bar steak I think it was called, and their fried oysters which were probably one of the best things I have ever eaten. The only thing that bothered me was that the server didn't seem to be super knowledgeable but I forgave her because I'm pretty sure she was new. The second time I went not only was the food great but the service was as well. I was recently diagnosed with a gluten intolerance and my server was very understanding and helpful. I ordered eggs benedict and asked to have some hash browns because I couldn't have the english muffin. She had the kitchen plate it with the hash browns under the eggs so it was like I was eating almost the same thing as the friend I was with. It was just fantastic...and the berry belini they were featuring was delicious as well. I would definitely go back here!

Go for dinner midweek.  When it's busy, it feels as if the quality goes downhill very quickly. Ate here two months ago on a Wednesday and was treated very well and really enjoyed myself.  Went on a Friday and was disappointed.   Steak tartare is a must. Portions are somewhat small.  I ordered the striped bass, and got about a 5oz portion of striped bass with farro and broccoli rabe.  It was $28.  The skin was charred.  A striper, when done right, can be a true delight.  This was subpar, and looking back I should have sent it back. My girlfriend's steak frites: ordered medium, came out rare; fries- cold. Tuna au poivre: four quarter-inch slices, mound of salad. Fun wine list. Great atmosphere. Poor, unfriendly service. Nice dessert variety. Honestly, I won't go back.  But I wouldn't go to Artist's Palate, either.
Judging from the Saturday night crowd, I don't think B292 needs an additional 5 star review...but our second trip there was pretty darned stellar, so an upgrade to the original review is warranted! The food, once again - was awesome. Perfect salad starters, followed by duck leg confit for me, Mussels Frites for her -- both packed with flavor and executed flawlessly. This time, though, I left more than satisfied with the portion. If I have a quibble with the place, it's that the seating is a little tight - and, as others have said, it can be pretty loud. This all being said, will I come back? Without question. Regularly. Also, it is worth noting that B292 may serve the most sublimely perfect Manhattan I have ever sampled. The bourbon-soaked Amarena (not Maraschino!) cherries put it completely and totally over the top.
I really love this restaurant. I have been there twice and I can't complain about the food at all. The first time I went I had a delicious bourbon cocktail, the bar steak I think it was called, and their fried oysters which were probably one of the best things I have ever eaten. The only thing that bothered me was that the server didn't seem to be super knowledgeable but I forgave her because I'm pretty sure she was new. The second time I went not only was the food great but the service was as well. I was recently diagnosed with a gluten intolerance and my server was very understanding and helpful. I ordered eggs benedict and asked to have some hash browns because I couldn't have the english muffin. She had the kitchen plate it with the hash browns under the eggs so it was like I was eating almost the same thing as the friend I was with. It was just fantastic...and the berry belini they were featuring was delicious as well. I would definitely go back here!
I had dinner with a group of friends last Thursday... it was my first visit to Brasserie 292. I continue to be impressed with the new offerings on Main St. Poughkeepsie; Brasserie is a nice addition to Bull & Buddha, Artist's Palate, Karma Lounge, Canvas, etc. The decor is perfect; as other reviewers have said, it's definitely a "I'm in Poughkeepsie?" moment upon walking in. The details are impeccable, but the floor-to-ceiling tiles and other hard, reflective surfaces make the space impossibly loud at dinner time. I consistently had trouble hearing the waitstaff. (I also found the long, wide hallways to the restrooms to be a waste of space.) Having said that, the cocktails and food were fantastic. I had a beautifully prepared Manhattan, and most of the other cocktails on the menu were sampled by my friends. The Dark and Stormy was delicious, but the Hemingway Daiquiri left a bit to be desired... perhaps it's just not my taste; I prefer a classic daiquiri. We shared the Camembert, oysters and escargot appetizers, and each was just perfectly prepared. I had the daily special-spaghetti and meatballs!-and found it delicious. Everyone enjoyed his meal, and I think it's safe to say we'll be back again soon.
Go for dinner midweek.  When it's busy, it feels as if the quality goes downhill very quickly. Ate here two months ago on a Wednesday and was treated very well and really enjoyed myself.  Went on a Friday and was disappointed.   Steak tartare is a must. Portions are somewhat small.  I ordered the striped bass, and got about a 5oz portion of striped bass with farro and broccoli rabe.  It was $28.  The skin was charred.  A striper, when done right, can be a true delight.  This was subpar, and looking back I should have sent it back. My girlfriend's steak frites: ordered medium, came out rare; fries- cold. Tuna au poivre: four quarter-inch slices, mound of salad. Fun wine list. Great atmosphere. Poor, unfriendly service. Nice dessert variety. Honestly, I won't go back.  But I wouldn't go to Artist's Palate, either.
Last week, a friend of mine joined me in treating another one of our good friends to a birthday luncheon at Brasserie 292.  We all work within walking distance of  this beautiful, brand new establishment, and so we all had been curious about checking it out.   The decor is cleanly spectacular and the owners spared no expense in the massive renovation of the unique former "Elting" building that I have long admired whilst strolling down Main Street many times over the years.  Brasserie 292 and the adjacent "Z's Deli" are fine additions to the ever- increasing fine dining and night life scene emerging in the down-town Poughkeepsie area - an area that had, sadly,  transformed into seedy territory during the last 3 decades. But is happily now under going a much needed revitalization. The food - a special beef steak sandwich and crab cake sandwiches were all wonderful, and succulent according to my guests.  My crab cake definitely  ranked 'up there' with some of the best that I've had while dining out.   Service was fine- no complaints.  However, the restaurant was scarcely occupied when we first arrived but then as we enjoyed our lunches, several more patrons arrived for lunch, also.  It's good to see an elegant place like this gaining a good rapport with the local community. Make no bones about it, Brasserie 292 is definitely 'pricey', but in my opinion I'll say its mostly worth the money.  "Mostly" meaning I'd feel a little more compelled to dine there on more of a regular basis if I didn't feel that doing so was going to break the bank (at least MY bank, that is!) I did have to chuckle, though at the fact that the drinking water is served by the waitstaff while at the table, and is dispensed from an unlabeled glass bottle.  I was amused at the method of delivery simply because I later discovered that the water was nothing other than the City of Poughkeepsie tap water, complete with sodium-hypochlorite for disinfection purposes.  DPD1 never lies! ;)
Judging from the Saturday night crowd, I don't think B292 needs an additional 5 star review...but our second trip there was pretty darned stellar, so an upgrade to the original review is warranted! The food, once again - was awesome. Perfect salad starters, followed by duck leg confit for me, Mussels Frites for her -- both packed with flavor and executed flawlessly. This time, though, I left more than satisfied with the portion. If I have a quibble with the place, it's that the seating is a little tight - and, as others have said, it can be pretty loud. This all being said, will I come back? Without question. Regularly. Also, it is worth noting that B292 may serve the most sublimely perfect Manhattan I have ever sampled. The bourbon-soaked Amarena (not Maraschino!) cherries put it completely and totally over the top.
I've been to France a few times, so I was super excited to see a Brasserie open up in Poughkeepsie.  My girlfriend and I tried this for her birthday and weren't disappointed.  We initially were sat at a table, but, if you're going there for a date, ask for a booth, much more intimate.   We started with champagne cocktails which were excellent.  I got the escargots (which were fine, but I've been spoiled by the snails in Beaune) and some special oysters of the day (fresh and tasty).  She got the warm camembert appetizer with apples and arugula, really good as well.  For an entree I had the tuna au poivre which is really one of the best dishes I've had in a while and (pepper encrusted tuna steaks in a tomatoey reduction with onions and potatoes) and she got the duck confit.  Some wine and drinks and baked meringue for dessert and we were happy and full. It was pricey, but definitely fair for the quality of food.  I'd go back again tomorrow if I could.

This is our third visit and this place continues to improve and impress me.  Tonight we enjoyed the steak frites and tagliatelle with mushrooms and asparagus.  Everything was spot on. The pièce de résistance was the local apple tarte tatin with salted butter caramel.  To. die. for. I've been negotiating with the owners to reserve my own cot in the kitchen, so that I can dine round the clock here!  I'll keep you posted.

I enjoyed my meal thoroughly even though the ceviche wasn't citrusy enough for my taste, and I was upset my omelette came with a salad instead of home fries. I suppose I should blame the french rather than they chefs for these oversights as I am often unclear where tradition ends and bad restauranteering begins.  The omelette itself was superb. A very weird thing happened after my meal, however, when my uncle went to use the bathroom; he never came back. Later my brother also went to the bathroom and then he never came back. Eventually we went and found them waiting in line. It seems one gentleman set up a camp in the restroom and refused to leave. Hopefully they can fix the omelette not coming with fries and the bathroom issues and then this place will be five stars!

Short version: Food was good, service was poor and incredibly slow. Long version: Had a 7:30 reservation on a Saturday night.  Came in, party of 4, and were seated immediately, with 1 menu.  5 minutes later, the maitre'd passed by again and we asked her for more menus.  She apologized saying there was a large group that had recently come in and they were working to get us menus.  Our waitress arrived 2 minutes later and asked for our drink order, only problem, 3 of us hadn't seen the menu (on which there are numerous cocktails, which we had heard were a large draw of this place).  She apologized and went to find more menus.  First one more arrived, then a couple minutes later 2 more arrived, and we finally all had menus.  Sorry but this is a dinner rush on a Saturday night, restaurants should be prepared for this...The waitress came back and we placed our entire order at that time, drinks, apps, and entrees. Our cocktails took 15 minutes to arrive.  They were tasty for sure, but took forever to get there and weren't filled to the top of the glass.  Also, the ice was melted in several of our cocktails by the time they arrived.  For $10 a pop, I expect the drink to touch the top of the glass, and the ice to still be in a solid state of matter. Our appetizers arrived 25 minutes later, escargot and French onion soup.  Both good.  Apps arriving an hour after sitting down, not so good. Our entrees arrived at 9pm, for those at home, that's an hour and a half after sitting down.  Two 8 ounce steaks, both with a mountain of fries, a 6oz piece of salmon on vegetables, and my entree, the crab and marscapone tortelloni.  This is where I had another problem, portion sizes not remotely equivalent for plates listed in the "entree" section of the menu.  I got 5 tortelloni with my entree.  When the foodrunner dropped off our entrees and asked if he could get us anything else, we joked with him 'Yes, the other half of my dinner'.  Seriously, 2 steaks and mountains of fries, a nice piece of fish and veg, and 5 tortelloni with some peas.  I wanted to share some of them with the rest of my group, but if I gave everyone a taste I would have literally been giving away 60% of my dinner.  The food all tasted good anyway. Finally, my wife asked to get her leftovers boxed up, and we received our check, when the waitress let us know they removed 2 of our drinks from the tab due to the slow service.  At least that was nice of them. It wasn't until next morning when we wanted her left over steak with breakfast, that we realized they never brought out her boxed dinner to us.  Yeesh. TL;DR - Food was good, service was bad, and for the price, both service and food should be good.  Probably won't go back because there are lots of other good restaurants in the Hudson Valley, where I know I will get a great experience.
Went to the Brasserie 292 for a family birthday celebration dinner on Saturday and absolutely loved it! The staff is very attentive yet unobtrusive. We were celebrating my husband's birthday but never mentioned it to the staff but they noticed our toast at the table and brought out his dessert with a candle - nice touch. Food was fantastic all around. The tuna tartare appetizer was fabulous and the steak frites and salmon entrees were cooked perfectly and were delicious. The burger was huge & fries delicious. For dessert we shared the chocolate creme pot and the cheesecake and they were both fantastic along with a really good cup of coffee.  I would highly recommend the Brasserie 292 if you are in the Poughkeepsie area and looking for an upscale dining spot.
Easily one of the best meals (if not THE best meal) that I have ever had in the Hudson Valley. It was hard to believe that we were in the middle of Poughkeepsie, not to mention on a street that I was hesitant to walk down a few years ago when I was going to school there. It feels like you're in the middle of a chic little bistro in Manhattan and the crowd certainly lends to that impression as well. Service was absolutely spot-on. I think our server's name was Vanessa and she was fabulous, hitting that fine line between attentive and non-intrusive. A manager came to check on us partially through the meal and the busboys were always around with extra bread or water bottles. The staff seems to work as a team here, which is nice to see. Oh, and the food... incredible. I started with a special soup (creamy pea & fennel) while my husband got escargot. Both were excellent. They put fresh, whole peas in my soup and they were like little bursts of sweetness. For entrees, we ordered the duck confit and pork shank. Now, I'll admit that I am not the biggest pork fan and I only ordered it because I really wanted the polenta and broccolini that came with it. Shameful, I know, but it worked out in my favor because I loved the pork. Brasserie 292 has totally shown me the pork light. Lastly, we split the profiteroles for dessert. We both expected something small, even though it was priced at $9. Nope. They give you three sizeable profiteroles filled with gelato and covered with this super-rich chocolate sauce. We had one each and gave up, but it was only because we were completely full. It probably could have been enough for 3 or 4 people. So, a very positive experience and we're hoping to return for brunch in the near future. Quite a drive for us, but we're confident it'll be worth it again!
Loud, long cavernous dining room. Walls are covered in mirrors, Ceilings... tin. Kitchen is on point with many of the dishes. Mussels & Frites, Roast fish, Steak, Tagliatele and even the Meatballs are things I've had over the five times I've dined here so far. Staff is friendly and efficient. Bar has some great, hard to find beer and liquor selections and is a great dining option if you can't snag a table. Overall, I've been a fan since the day it opened... my only qualm being that I wish it was a little cheaper. (Difficult to get a table on the weekend.)
Decor, service, and food was very good to excellent. The chowder with seafood and sprouts, the fish, were excellent.  Only minor complaint was a medium burger was not hot when it arrive (they were very open to warming it up) and the bread should be at least warm at such a high-end restaurant...but all-in-all at least a 4 and probably and 4.5
Really an unexpected find on a recent trip to the Poughkeepsie area.  I went on Yelp first and many people had said the same, so we went.  I am from Las Vegas and I said that it reminded me of a small, more intimate Mon Amie Gabie (at Paris in Las Vegas).  French steakhouse feel, but much more welcoming and intimate than that stereotype.  We ordered some suggestions that we took from our darling waiter and were not disappointed, especially the oysters.   Wine selection was good and their wine prices were very reasonable.
One of the nicest brunches I've had! Friendly service who are dressed très chic à la parisienne. I think this is as French as it gets in Poughkeepsie and this cute little bistro is certainly on par with some French brasseries I've visited in NYC. The beet salad with pistachio dressing was scrumptious. We ordered the bread basket which had an interesting assortment of sweet and salty breads, but if you are going to choose just one, go for the croissant (which delicious with orange marmalade) or the cheesy bread.
It is amazing that this place is in downtown Poughkeepsie.  My daughter and her boy friend attend Culunary Institute of America and suggested we go there for dinner.  If you told me I was in a classy bistro in LA, Chicago, NYC, SF, I would believe you. Great food.  We had Pork Chops, Risotto, Salmon and Mussel.  Everything was great.  Desert was also great.  Carrot cake, house made donut holes filled with apple butter and hot chocolate with nutella, fresh marshmallows and hot cookies. Amazing service.  Attention to detail.  It is one of top restaurants that I have been to in the last year. Bravo for a great evening...
This place is AMAZING! Came here but once with my fiance before a show around the corner at the Bardavon (Keb Mo!!!!). Although it was super expensive, it was so worth it. They were packed, and because they knew we were going to a show and wanted to get us in on time, they put us in this side room, which was actually way nicer because it wasn't as busy and certainly not as loud. I ordered the braised pork shank which came highly recommended by our waiter, and for good reason. It just melted off the bone! It was perfectly cooked, and even the vegetables were amazing. My fiance got the Brasserie Burger with french fries and it was out of control! It came loaded with a fried egg and a mountain of hearty bacon. We also ordered a few drinks, and their chocolate/espresso martinis were to die for.  Will definitely go back the nest time we feel like treating ourselves to a fantastic meal.

Great atmosphere, awesome steaks--one of my favorite places to eat in Poughkeepaie. It's a high-end, expensive French restaurant randomly thrown in the middle of Main St Poughkeepsie.

I had an amazing three course meal at Brasserie tonight. The food overall was very good, but what won me over was the atmosphere and the staff. Spent more than I normally do, but it was worth it as a treat. Definitely a place I will be returning to and I recommend it.

I can't believe this restaurant is local. It has a NYC feel. I never finished the review from two years ago. Yesterday, I had the chance to return and I'm happy to say things haven't changed. Food, service and atmosphere were excellent. I hope I don't let two years pass before I visit again.  Great food selection for brunch and dinner.  It's a perfect place to go to before an event at the Mid Hudson Civic Center. All the food is made with care. Go for brunch, they had a great jazz band, not too loud so you can still have a conversation.
Loud, long cavernous dining room. Walls are covered in mirrors, Ceilings... tin. Kitchen is on point with many of the dishes.

My best friend made a reservation for herself and I since we have been wanting to try a French restaurant for some time.  Arrived on time there were tables in the middle and booths on both sides.  You're sitting remotely close to other people, but still had a intimate ambiance.  The decor is on point; to some pictures in the reviews and feels like you are transported to a different location.  Like also many said you completely forget you're in downtown Poughkeepsie.  After taking our drinks a bread basket was delivered which was delicious.  We had lobster and peas risotto which my friend and I devoured it within minutes.  For entree I had the chicken which came with broccolini and mash potatoes which the chicken was some what small, but was satisfied.  The Rosemarie on the mash potatoes was very refreshing.  My friend ordered the steak frites which looked mouth watering too.  For dessert I had the walnut carrot cake which comes with a baby scoop of carrot gelato.  The Tate was crunchy and a good portion.  My friend had the milk chocolate creme pot which I stole a scoop of and tasted like dark chocolate mouse.  All in all for two drinks, one appetizer, 2 entrees and 2 desserts total came to $110.  Price was worth it the food was amazing no complaints. Overall  the service was always attentive, but not hovering.  Only complaint would be you're sitting close to other people and tables are quite small.  Would definitely go back food is awesome and service.  Will be going maybe for my sisters birthday!! This place totally a 4.5/5.

We'll have to give it a second try. The waitstaff was excellent. The atmosphere makes you feel like you're in a fancy city restaurant. My beet salad was awesome. Risotto was great. However my cod was undercooked. I don't enjoy the chewiness of raw cod. And my husband's steak only saw the grill top for a couple of minutes. Did he ask for it raw? Maybe he didn't speak up when he asked for it medium rare. Carrot cake bread pudding phenomenal.

I grew up in Poughkeepsie and came to visit the walkway over the Hudson. After an enjoyable walk we decided to look for a nice upscale yet casual restaurant. Wow did we find it with Brasserie 292. Everything was great. The decor with an ornate ceiling, tiled walls, the service with an attentive knowledgable waitress, the wine list with many fine reasonable choices and of course the food! Excellent! Tasty oysters, French onion soup, ceviche, cockles, and duck entrees. We'll be back!

Every now and then your birthday will fall on a Monday and in these parts a lot of great places are closed... Step up Brasserie 292 It's a real brasserie so it's open! You have to pinch yourself to make sure you're not at Balthazar in Soho But if you're going to model yourself on someone it's a great pick! This was my 3rd visit A chaotic group dinner wasn't a good barometer plus a delicious brunch, but this was special occasion stuff Exciting wine list We splashed out on a great Pinot and were then told Monday is 50% off wine night! Screw it, we ordered the most expensive bottle on the list the 2010 Sea Smoke It was just like Paul Giamatti in Sideways Delicious... Oysters were wonderful Cheese Plate local and fun Beautiful presentation Steak Frites were everything they're supposed to be and nothing that they're not Pot de Creme was the right side of intense Yes it wasn't cheap, but we did go all out Service was beautiful people who knew and liked their job And our car was still intact on Main St I'll be back for the Prem Cru Mersault another Monday
It is amazing that this place is in downtown Poughkeepsie.  My daughter and her boy friend attend Culunary Institute of America and suggested we go there for dinner.  If you told me I was in a classy bistro in LA, Chicago, NYC, SF, I would believe you. Great food.  We had Pork Chops, Risotto, Salmon and Mussel.  Everything was great.  Desert was also great.  Carrot cake, house made donut holes filled with apple butter and hot chocolate with nutella, fresh marshmallows and hot cookies. Amazing service.  Attention to detail.  It is one of top restaurants that I have been to in the last year. Bravo for a great evening...
Amazing & wonderful!!! Highly recommended!!! Chatham Camembert appetizer is to die for!! Awesome ambiance and great wine choices!!
This place is AMAZING! Came here but once with my fiance before a show around the corner at the Bardavon (Keb Mo!!!!). Although it was super expensive, it was so worth it. They were packed, and because they knew we were going to a show and wanted to get us in on time, they put us in this side room, which was actually way nicer because it wasn't as busy and certainly not as loud. I ordered the braised pork shank which came highly recommended by our waiter, and for good reason. It just melted off the bone! It was perfectly cooked, and even the vegetables were amazing. My fiance got the Brasserie Burger with french fries and it was out of control! It came loaded with a fried egg and a mountain of hearty bacon. We also ordered a few drinks, and their chocolate/espresso martinis were to die for.  Will definitely go back the nest time we feel like treating ourselves to a fantastic meal.
Very good restaurant with an interesting broadly French menu .Went there for Sunday brunch.I don't like brunch and fortunately you can eat lunch.They have a Sunday special- Blue Point oysters at $1 an oyster .That's a real bargain! I loved them!I followed up with an excellent steak tartare. One of my party had a lobster roll which he liked accompanied by excellent French Fries.The others liked their omelets.I drank Peekskill IPA- terrific!The space is noisy but very attractive.The neighborhood looks a bit shaky.One serious complaint - service was very, very ssllloww!However the waitress was nice.I'd go back.
Great atmosphere, awesome steaks--one of my favorite places to eat in Poughkeepaie. It's a high-end, expensive French restaurant randomly thrown in the middle of Main St Poughkeepsie.
A surprising gem... French-influenced food made well, an interesting seasonal menu, classic brasserie appointments with a modern New York feel... all in all nothing like I expected to find in Poughkeepsie. Great service and an overall enjoyable experience. My only qualm was the limited wine list - not a big deal as all the selections were excellent...
I had an amazing three course meal at Brasserie tonight. The food overall was very good, but what won me over was the atmosphere and the staff. Spent more than I normally do, but it was worth it as a treat. Definitely a place I will be returning to and I recommend it.
I'm originally from the Hudson Valley, but I was in town last Friday and decided to meet up with an old friend at this new place. I had heard good things about this place, and decided to multi-task by checking this place out while catching up. The location is on Main Street, and it is hard to miss, so no worries if  you are from out of town. The bad news is that it's close to the "not so nice" part of Poughkeepsie (upon parking on the street, I was promptly greeted with one of the local "upstanding gentlemen" about how I needed to talk to him, and then give him $2). Not much of an issue for a grown man, but ladies, watch out. The restaurant itself is very well decorated, and has a bistro look that goes for classy and trendy at the same time. I couldn't help shake the feeling it had a bit of a 50s diner vibe from the booths and tables and how they looked, but I know it's a French restaurant. The tables settings were well arranged, and when they saw it was a party of two, the promptly removed the extra setting. They have a small, but decent wine selection; their Chardonnay was pretty good, and I would recommend it to others. For appetizers, I had their oysters of the day, which I cannot recall the exact name. They were small, but very good, and no complaints. For dinner, I had the Duck Confit and spinach, both of which were excellent. The spinach was really good, and had the exact amount of seasoning. It wasn't complex, but it still tasted great. The duck was good too, and I liked that it was not dry. The vegetables in the dish were terrific and they went great together, and with the seasoning. For dessert, my guest and I split the Creme Brulee, which was decent, but nothing impressive. Two appetizers, two glasses of wine, two entrees, and one dessert went for $140, so it's a bit on the pricey side. It was good food, but tough to justify the high price. The food is excellent, but just doesn't have that kind of WOW factor to take it over the edge, and make it 5 stars. I think Brasserie needs to be a bit more modest, and recognize they are not in NYC, and to reconsider their pricing. They may also want to keep in mind, that while they may not have a lot of competitors, the ones they do have been around for ALOT longer (Casa Milanese, Shadows, even Bull and Buddha, though I do like Brasserie better than Bull and Buddha). They may get the curious foodie, but odds are, if they are local, they might migrate back to their familiar eateries rather than fork over $140 for two.
I can't believe this restaurant is local. It has a NYC feel. I never finished the review from two years ago. Yesterday, I had the chance to return and I'm happy to say things haven't changed. Food, service and atmosphere were excellent. I hope I don't let two years pass before I visit again.  Great food selection for brunch and dinner.  It's a perfect place to go to before an event at the Mid Hudson Civic Center. All the food is made with care. Go for brunch, they had a great jazz band, not too loud so you can still have a conversation.
I've been here a million times. Service is always prompt, attentive and knowledgeable . Food is so consistent, and delicious every time. Menu is just a tad different every time I go. Great commitment to local fare. All in all, I've never had a bad experience here and it's the first place I recommend to someone asking about where to eat in Poughkeepsie.
My best friend made a reservation for herself and I since we have been wanting to try a French restaurant for some time.  Arrived on time there were tables in the middle and booths on both sides.  You're sitting remotely close to other people, but still had a intimate ambiance.  The decor is on point; to some pictures in the reviews and feels like you are transported to a different location.  Like also many said you completely forget you're in downtown Poughkeepsie.  After taking our drinks a bread basket was delivered which was delicious.  We had lobster and peas risotto which my friend and I devoured it within minutes.  For entree I had the chicken which came with broccolini and mash potatoes which the chicken was some what small, but was satisfied.  The Rosemarie on the mash potatoes was very refreshing.  My friend ordered the steak frites which looked mouth watering too.  For dessert I had the walnut carrot cake which comes with a baby scoop of carrot gelato.  The Tate was crunchy and a good portion.  My friend had the milk chocolate creme pot which I stole a scoop of and tasted like dark chocolate mouse.  All in all for two drinks, one appetizer, 2 entrees and 2 desserts total came to $110.  Price was worth it the food was amazing no complaints. Overall  the service was always attentive, but not hovering.  Only complaint would be you're sitting close to other people and tables are quite small.  Would definitely go back food is awesome and service.  Will be going maybe for my sisters birthday!! This place totally a 4.5/5.
Absolutely horrible service Béarnaise sauce was watery Aioli sauce was watery Pommes frites (glorified french fries) were the side dish for all entrees pretty much and they were too wimpy to hold up the sauce Where's the salad and/or vegetables? For a French restaurant , very chintzy with the butter. The herb butter on my friend's steak wouldn't even melt because the steak was cold They brought appetizer after dinner They brought the wife's drink without bringing the husbands
We'll have to give it a second try. The waitstaff was excellent. The atmosphere makes you feel like you're in a fancy city restaurant. My beet salad was awesome. Risotto was great. However my cod was undercooked. I don't enjoy the chewiness of raw cod. And my husband's steak only saw the grill top for a couple of minutes. Did he ask for it raw? Maybe he didn't speak up when he asked for it medium rare. Carrot cake bread pudding phenomenal.
Returned to Brasserie 292 yet again and, as usual, had a great experience.  If you haven't been here for Sunday brunch you don't know what you're missing!  Not only do you get to enjoy the consistent high level of service and the great surroundings, you get to feast on an imaginative array of menu selections.  This is not your typical brunch fare!  Always a refreshing twist on food and, of course, drink.  Enjoy!
I grew up in Poughkeepsie and came to visit the walkway over the Hudson. After an enjoyable walk we decided to look for a nice upscale yet casual restaurant. Wow did we find it with Brasserie 292. Everything was great. The decor with an ornate ceiling, tiled walls, the service with an attentive knowledgable waitress, the wine list with many fine reasonable choices and of course the food! Excellent! Tasty oysters, French onion soup, ceviche, cockles, and duck entrees. We'll be back!
Came twice for brunch. Overall the selection is good and staff is professional. So far, the food is average. Both times I ordered egg dishes, omelette and scramble. In both cases, they were overdone. Also tried the blue point oysters (1$/ea during Sunday brunch), they were better than at other places in the area. I will go back and try some else.
Every now and then your birthday will fall on a Monday and in these parts a lot of great places are closed... Step up Brasserie 292 It's a real brasserie so it's open! You have to pinch yourself to make sure you're not at Balthazar in Soho But if you're going to model yourself on someone it's a great pick! This was my 3rd visit A chaotic group dinner wasn't a good barometer plus a delicious brunch, but this was special occasion stuff Exciting wine list We splashed out on a great Pinot and were then told Monday is 50% off wine night!

Worst experience of my life. Not only did the server roll her eyes at us (mind you we were a party of 8 that was an auto grat) but they tried to charge us $58 dollars to put a piece of pie on a plate. They never mentioned a charge and they offered to warm it up but never did. They charged is $18 for a tablespoon of melted ice cream all over the plate and when we asked the server of the charge she said it was the policy. It took us 30 minutes to be able to speak to a manager and when he did he treated us like children. He removed the bill and the charge then literally threw it at our table and walked away. Terrible customer service and I have never been treated that way in my life. Do not go here unless you want to be over charged and eat food that is new York city prices in the middle of Poughkeepsie but not near the quality. I will never return and will only say bad things of this place.
Amazing & wonderful!!! Highly recommended!!! Chatham Camembert appetizer is to die for!! Awesome ambiance and great wine choices!!
By the time we got to Poughkeepsie, we may have eaten anywhere. We were starving after a long drive . I had no idea what to expect and felt we must have misunderstood the hotel receptionist as he told us to check out Main Street Poughkeepsie, which was not at all what we expected... seemed like a downtown where all the businesses had fled and just a tired, kinda boarded up place with some cool architecture. I was not feeling too optimistic about finding a decent place to eat . We ended up asking a young man on the street  who had recently moved from Manhattan and he recommended this place.   And it turned out to be excellent, like a San Francisco restaurant but with friendly servers.  Ok, just kidding but the serving staff did seem exceptionally young, attractive and friendly. Bread and drinks came fast, and I thought the bread was excellent. I ordered the steak poivre and it was so big that there was no way I could finish it. The meat was tender and the sauce peppery and buttery. My BF had the lone chicken dish and ate every bit. He wasn't initially thrilled with the menu but ended up liking his food a lot. Although I don't anticipate getting to Poughkeepsie again anytime soon, I would definitely go here again if I had the chance.

This is definitely my favorite place to go in Poughkeepsie. I love the atmosphere and the energy mostly, but the food can be really excellent as well. I recommend the Steak Tartar. All I can say about it is, "WOW"

As I begin to write this review, I reminded myself not to rate it until something within this write up tells me what is a rightful rating.   Walking into Brasserie I felt as I have once before experienced this.  There was a dinning room filled with people that all shared a common smile.  The wait staff was very professional and they as a team worked well with one another.  Not for one moment did I feel neglected.  The menu was simple enough to understand yet stood as a heavy weight.  A nice line-up for what every your palate craves. Portions were just the right, and they didn't overload us with bread, which I might add, "had you asking for more".  A nice job on the beer selections, but sometimes I like enjoy a familiar face.  I am not going to bore you with what I ate, or suggest for you anything that enjoyed.  Notice I said "enjoyed".  Enjoyed is exactly what I did.  I enjoyed my experience. The restrooms were out of sight.  If you can't appreciate that you will not appreciate this review, (click the back arrow now).  Not only were they out of sight they were "out a sight".  one at a time bathrooms, are good because I like my space.   I didn't like the desserts.  OK, I can eat, and I can eat desserts too. As a matter of fact, I just killed a cookie! 5 star cookie (my daughter made them) I love CC cookies that have a little bit of a saltness to them.  Sorry A.D.D. moment. NYC has a Balthazar, and when I dared to ask if they were the same owners, the staff answered "no".   I do not know if the standard layout for a "Brasserie" is that of which Brasserie 292 and Balthazar share, so I will leave it at that.   As for pricing... who gives a shit...It was enjoyed I wish I didn't order dessert
