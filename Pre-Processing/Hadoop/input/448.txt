Syracuse Stage is one of those treasures that people are always surprised to find in a mid-sized city.  Great performances at a reasonable price.  I've been going here since I was a kid.  Even in college we used to drive in from an hour and a half away to see plays here.
Worth Buying A Series of Tickets I have lived in Syracuse for 3 years now.  I have seen several well done productions including "Reds" and the August Williams play to mention a couple. The theater is old and in need of renovation.  Some of the acting and staging are first rate however.  Seeing performances here adds some cultural comfort for this NYC girl who is not disappointed and sometimes delighted.
This place is like Syracuse itself, old and worn out. Bathrooms have 2 stalls with long line-ups all the time during intermissions.  And seriously, a discount if you are under the age of 40? Why do they do that? So if you are 40-65 you get screwed with a lot higher price--what morons.  The seats are comfy but this theater really needs a makeover. If Syracuse had any smarts, they would tear it down and build a new facility. Don't even get me started on the Radio Shack speakers they have nailed to the front of the stage. And, why is all the casting here full of actors that can't act (or sing)? The female stage manager and band leader also seems weird--very odd bunch. Stay away. And if you want to spare yourself from listening to actors and so-called performers speaking so highly of themselves with their loud detailed dreams of Broadway and London I suggest you stay away from Phoebes Restaurant across the street.  They really ain't all that, not even close.
Many great experiences at Syracuse Stage.  Syracuse is lucky to have it. Every seat is good. Parking is cheap.  Good food nearby.
