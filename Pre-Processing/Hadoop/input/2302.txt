We had a great time on the Vinifera Varieties wine tour on Seneca Lake.  I hesitated to book a tour because we typically like to do wine tasting at our own pace, but I'm really glad we decided to do this as a guided tour.  I will recommend this tour to friends. Laura is a great guide.  She is very knowledgeable and provided a lot of interesting information about the area.  She took the time to learn everyone's palate and provided personalized recommendations.  The cheese and chocolate pairings were delicious.  I had never been a huge fan of Finger Lakes wine, but Laura chose the best wineries that really showcase the region.  I'm a convert!
Let's put it this way, their tour was so good, we did another the 2nd day! Our first tour was the Vine, Wine and Dine tour, we got to visit 4 wineries and have lunch at the 2nd stop. It was perfect, we got special tastings for being on this tour. Everything was already set up for us when we arrived and we were tasting with the owners of each winery. Such a neat experience that we would of never gotten on our own. Got to learn about each wine, harvesting of the grapes and the area. Even got up close to the grapes and vineyards. Lunch was incredible, at the Red Newt, very tasty and fresh. We bought a bottle of wine at each winery (2 at one), it was neat trying to find our favorite and being able to purchase it. They keep the van stocked with snacks and they give us each a cool water bottle (with ice cold water) to take with home as a gift. The tour guide, Chris, was great. He had a real passion for wine and very knowledgeable about the area. The icing on the cake for this tour, was they take your photo at the first winery (GORGEOUS views) and at the end it's printed in another take home gift with a frame.  AWESOME touch! At Experience! The Finger Lakes they have nailed it for tours and how to make us tourists HAPPY! The 2nd tour was the Fabulous Falls Tour of Ithaca we did with Laura. I would of have been so disappointed if we didn't do this tour. One- Laura is so incredibly knowledgeable about  Ithaca and the Finger lakes, she was a student at Cornell and loved it and never left.  You can tell she has a lot of pride in the area which in returns gets you really excited about the area as well. Two- This tour takes you around the university and see these AMAZING waterfalls and gorges from glaciers that are all through the university. We would have never known about these or where to even find them, very hidden gems. Truly breathtaking. This tour is another can't miss, again they had our waters and snacks in the van for us. Little driving, everything was very close. Can't say enough great things about Experience! The Finger Lakes - Made our trip worthwhile! Thanks!
Perfection!!! We had a group of about 12 who were picked up from Hotel ithaca on time at 11am.  Laura was our guide.  Everyone on the van was greeted with a cold water bottle and as we traveled we played games for candy etc.  Laura was amazing.   She was super knowledgeable, funny, and had a great spirit.  We did the spirits, wine and beer tour which was a great mix of various liquor types in different locations around the lake.  The entire tour was 7 hours but never a dull moment.  Every stop (including lunch) we were greeted with a diverse set of cocktail choices and pairing options. Laura even snuck in an extra wine stop along the way. The group we had was also really amazing.  Everyone bonded and became good friends by last stop.  We even organized an outing together after the tour was over.  In general, this tour exceeded my wildest expectations and if your looking for an amazing guided wine tour of the finger lakes region this is it.   @illmaticwes81
Our tour of the vineyards through out the finger lakes region was incredible. Our tour guide , Laura , was very informative especially when pairing certain wines with foods. She was also extremely petsonable and friendly! At one point she had given each set of group their own photo frames at one of the vineyards. The experience overall was truly one for the books! I highly recommend using this company to get a true understanding of the wine from fingerlakes !
I found a list of tours on a Google search and USA Today article popped up. After reviewing a few of the websites, this company seemed like the best bet. I signed up for the tour just 4 days before it. I signed up for the $115 Culinary Wine Tour on Cayuga, which seemed like the best bet also I know nothing about wine pairings so this seemed like a good way to learn.  We promptly got picked up at the holiday inn in downtown ithaca. There were people from as far away as Ohio.   We loaded up into the van once we all signed the waiver. I was pleasantly surprised to find snacks and  filled up water bottles which we got to keep.  Our tour guide for the day, Chris, was really awesome and knowledgeable about the areas and each of the wineieries we went to. We went to three wineieries during the day: Sheldrake winery for the first course, Cayuga Ridge Estate for lunch, and Americana Wines for our dessert.  I probably tried close to 20 wines over the course of the day. Everything was delicious. I ended up buy 6 bottles over the course of the day and my boyfriend bought 7 bottles.  Chris was awesome and carried and stored our bottles for us for each location. Chris was really awesome and took us to see an awesome waterfall at Taughannock Falls State Park in Ithaca on our way back. We even got a framed picture which was taken at our first wine stop.  Learned so much about wine that I haven't been able to get just from going to wine festivals which are always packed with people. I loved the wine tour at the 2nd location where they showed us how they make the wines. Price seems steep to most but definitely worth the money and its the best way to travel around the Finger Lakes.
This was a fantastic wine tour!  We also did the Seneca / Vinifera tour with Laura and it was absolutely the best wine tour I've ever taken.  Better than any tour operator we've ever used in Sonoma, Napa, or Russian River Valley. Each of the tastings was personalized for us and included appropriate food parings.  The lunch at Red Newt was wonderful, as were the wines.  At every winery we visited, we felt like we had VIP treatment - usually a separate area for our tasting and some "extra" wines that weren't available in the regular tasting room. Next time we're in Ithaca, we'll definitely do another tour.  I'd recommend this to friends as well.
This was an awesome bachelorette experience! We had Laura (the owner) as our tour guide. She knew all of our names and quickly figured out our separate tastes in wines. She was so personable and friendly it really made the tour for us! The Wines were all amazing and the lunch at the red newt grill was so yummy.
Wow.  We spent today with Caren from Experience! and had an AMAZING day.  Folks, this is not a wine tour.  This is spending an entire day traveling with someone who knows the people who run these vineyards - the people who grow the grapes, make the wine.  They spend time with you.  You are trying things you're not going to ever be able to try if you came on your own.  If I'm going to spend money on a "tour" it better be good.  This just blew me out of the water.  Absolutely GREAT day, amazing vineyards, food and wine pairings including local cheeses and custom made chocolates - wonderful conversation about everything local.  I just can't say enough about how positive an experience today was.  I unreservedly recommend Experience! The Finger Lakes.  I'm certain each of the guides are great, but if you can manage to spend the day with Caren, you're going to feel like you've spent the day with a great friend.  A++  Thank you!!!
