Checked table cloths, lots of booths, pizza on a metal tower on table, looks like homemade crust - classic Salad was just shredded iceberg lettuce with too much shredded cheese and two slices of pepperoni, sprinkled with Italian seasoning. Not what I was hoping for when I ordered a salad.

Had a white pizza there that we really enjoyed. We ordered a medium saying to ourselves that we'd take some back to the hotel with us for the next day but ended up eating all of it. We got a white pizza with ricotta, tomatoes and onions. The ricotta was so so good. I loved the crust. This is a totally casual pizza spot that has clearly been around forever. A great find.

Great pizza, great service. The menu is very basic.  I am a big fan of thin crust.   You will not be disappointed.

I cannot duplicate this pizza crust at home.  I have been going to Pace's since I was 16 years old (over 20 years) and it is MY favorite pizza and it is cooked to perfection every time.  The owner is great (the staff varies in friendliness), the decor comfortable and the pizza terrific.  Worst part it that I haven't lived in that area in 10 years or more, but everytime I go back, I stop there.  Now, I know very few people there and my family has left neighboring Warren, PA.  I miss the place.  Do try!
