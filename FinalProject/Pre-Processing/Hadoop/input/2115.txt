I once heard that there are two kinds of memorable places to eat. The first is the type of place you book for a special occasion, like a wedding. The second is the type of place you want to go to when you come home from military service. Jeremy's Bel View is the latter. Its comfort. Its a place to meet friends. No need for pomp and circumstance. Nothing fancy just consistent comfort food with generous portions; Pasta, chicken, steak, wings and burgers, etc. A small space, on Friday and Saturday evening you can expect to wait for a table, there are no reservations. The owner, Jeremy is frequently behind the bar, and the wait staff is friendly but busy people. You won't go broke, both meals and drinks are very reasonably priced.
At best Bel View is a place to get a mediocre meal at a cheap price as well as a fairly good drink. At worst, it tends to get crowd and loud. The patrons are generally the guy types wearing baseball caps, t-shirts and loud mouthing about sports. It's not exactly a dive bar but it is about the close as a place can come to it without actually being one. Of course, that is my unit of measurement, and it may be a dive bar in your opinion. It's one the few places where I see gentlemen (I use that word loosely), over age thirty, wearing their baseball hats backwards while drinking or dinning. Apparently Jamestown doesn't have an ordinance against anyone over 20 years of age doing that, but they should. The fact of the matter is, it would be difficult to "over dress" for a night out at the Bel View. As for its good points, though there are very few of them, I can say that it has been around for ages. I used to come here and get served when I was 16 years old, but that was over 50 years ago when serving a minor with phony ID was no big deal. So, I can assure anyone that it is and has been a popular place for a long, long time. The other good point is that the patrons are friendly, have plenty to talk about and the wait staff is totally polite as well as accommodating.
Small friendly atmosphere with exceptional service and great food. If you enjoy wings or fish fry you will be amazed. Stopped in 9 years ago and became a regular. I'm still sitting here. To go available. Try it you'll enjoy it.
Jeremy's Belview is a great little neighborhood bar. After a few visits, the staff at Jeremy's will have you feeling like a regular. I tend to end up at Jeremy's at some point during the week for burgers and wings with my wife, and then again on Saturday for a quick after work drink when we catch up on the week. The food at Jeremy's is consistent and always quality. The bar's got a decent-sized menu, but the burgers and wings (especially the Goldrush wings) are so good that we find it hard to stray. This past Sunday's first-time "Kegs & Eggs" for St. Patrick's Day was a great success. The green eggs and ham brunch was delicious, reasonably priced and a perfect start to the Sunday holiday. More than just that, the staff was into working on the morning of a St. Patrick's, serving up necessary drinks such Bloody Marys and Irish Coffees to a special martini called the Lucky Charm. They really made the morning special. Plus, being a neighborhood bar, Jeremy's is the type of place where you'll inevitably bump into a few familiar faces and will have a great time hanging out.
Jeremy's is usually pretty good--at least as far as wings and beer goes. Normally, the wings are pretty excellent, which is why I keep coming back. To be honest, though, the wings I got last night--Superbowl Sunday--were kind of shriveled and gnarly-looking. A number of them I won't even eat. (I'll probably make chicken stock out of them, at least). Hopefully a one time fluke.
I cannot say enough positive things about this establishment. The food is simple and well executed. The burgers are phenomenal and even when it is crowded you are treated well. The bartenders are attentive and know what you drink after only a few stops. They make you feel like a regular right from the start. The wait staff is experienced and great at what they do.

I've been here twice in my lifetime so far.  I wasn't impressed with my first visit and didn't come back for a while, but really enjoyed my second and plan to come back again soon. PRODUCT:  The first time I came here I got the fish fry.  I didn't think it was very good.  Go to "Davidson's Family Restaurant" instead for fish fry.  On my second visit I got Buffalo wings and they've got the best Buffalo wings in the area.  I like my Buffalo wings with a crispy skin, which is hard to find since most places drenched it in sauce and make it soggy.  The wings were a good size too.  The level of hotness was good for medium, which is what I usually get.  The bleu cheese container was wide and great for dipping.  If you're a big Buffalo wing with bleu cheese fan you'll know how annoying it is when you get a little contain and can't dip your wings.  Not to mention very little sauce. SERVICE:  I don't remember the quality of service with my first visit, but it didn't stick out in my mind so I would say it's average.  During my second visit I thought the waitress was friendly, but didn't work very optimized.  She asked us what we wanted for drinks first and came back in several minutes while we waited.  While she gave us our drinks she handed us menus, which I though should have been given to us when she asked for our drinks.  Even though the menu is a small one it still took us a little while to look it over, which we could have been doing while she's getting drinks.  When she brought our food out she just sat it down and walked away without asking if we needed anything else.  She didn't seem rude, but seem unexperienced or if that's her style it's not a good one.  Whenever we needed something we had to flag her down or ask her while she's walking away from our table.  I thought that was a little annoying. CLEANLINESS:  The place felt slightly dirty, but when you touched stuff it wasn't.  So maybe it's more of the look.  I didn't use the restrooms, so I'm not sure about them. ATMOSPHERE:  The right side of the room had a bar with stools around and the left side had tables.  There were two booths at the front and the remaining tables were just tables, not booths.  The two booths were all wood with no cushions (back & seat).  It has a small town bar feel to the place and felt a little cramped, but ok. OTHER NOTES:  They take credit cards, which is awesome.  The parking lot seems small, but could work if most car pooled.  It doesn't seem there's enough spaces for each table though, but based upon their location there's no way for them to expand it.  I definitely plan on visiting many times again for the Buffalo wings, but never for the fish fry.
