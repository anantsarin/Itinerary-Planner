I was here total of three times now. First experience was great. Food was delicious and inexpensive. Second time around didnt get to go in. It was sunday night and they suppose to be open till 10pm. It wasnt even 9 yet and they turned us away because chef was leaving early. Finally, our third try food was good. But they charge us extra to switching pork to chicken on a noodle dish. They didnt say that wen we were ordering. The service here is awful. They were so rude and mean about it. Just wanted us to pay up and leave. Recommendation: Dont even bother coming here. Try Work and roll or Eastern pearl. Much better food and friendly service.
The food is tasty but that's about all they have going for them. Service is terrible and it's quite expensive. The staff seemed very irritable with the most basic requests like napkins and water. And mind you,  this is on a night where there was only 2 or 3 tables besides my group. This is about the first Chinese place that charges you rice per bowl despite the fact that you've ordered hot dishes that normally are served with rice. But after some questioning, suddenly they say we can get some for free but have to pay for more? Very fishy to me. Oh and party of bigger than 6 beware. 18% gratuity is tacked on automatically. I don't mind tipping, especially with large groups, but I expect basic service without attitude and eye rolling. My group got attitude because we had a toddler and we wanted a set up for the child. Imagine that, a kid needing to eat too. Will not be going back any time soon.
First time I tried lunch special  and it was really good but pricey.  Though I don't mind paying a little more for better quality Chinese food,  it would be nice to be able to make some substitutions if you want to.   My coworkers and myself ordered  lunch today but we wanted full servings not lunch. The woman that took our order sounded confused that we wanted that like it was wrong but whatever. Then with the order asked if we could have fried rice instead of white rice was told no.   Another part was if we could upgrade to shrimp fried rice instead of plain rice and was also told no and that  we needed to pay full $10 extra for that. We accepted terms  because quality of food is good, but after this visit we all agreed wasn't  as good as first time.   I will probably  go back but not anytime soon due to decrease in quality of food,  pricing,  and strict stipulations.
I love this place!!! Decent price. Large space, good for big group parties. Awesome food. Tons of choices. REALLY SPICY food if you want to challenge them, at the same time they have tons of non spicy food (really 0 spiciness, I hate places that say non spicy but still spicy). Authentic Chinese food. Love it:)
I'm from Hunan. The taste of this restaurant is absolutely awesome. It way over my exception and the price is fair.
So I've been coming here ever since it opened but I felt like I needed to update this review for two (2) reasons... 1.  The prices have gone up 2.  The services have gone down The food... tastes about the same and so I won't revisit that part.  I mean it's tasty and that's what makes me go back.  But more and more I'm wondering if I'll have to curtail my patronage because I've been not too happy with their rising prices and dropping service quality. The prices going up doesn't need to much explanation.  Basically they took the most popular dishes and added a dollar or two... and/or they reduced the amount of food.   The service going down is a BIG no-no to me.  I can sort of understand the economics of prices going up (though I'm not in favor of that).  But the service going down is #whacksauce!  There's no effort on the part of the wait staff to preemptively deal with things that a customer might need:  napkins, cups, spoons... etc.  Whenever we do have to ask for these items I've been met with rolling of the eyes, visual displays of frustration or simply no response (like not getting me what I asked for). Some might comment "we're gonna have to be one of those tables tonight" and I'm thinking "no we don't."  We're not asking for miracles.  We're asking for prompt service and a good attitude.  Don't wanna be pestered for napkins?  Bring a bunch out the first time we ask.  Don't want to go back for more spoons?  Count the number of people and count the number of spoons when you go get them.  Don't like refilling pots of tea?  Bring out two or three.   Anyway.... like I said. The food is good.  I like it... I don't like the service.  Will I go back?  Eh... probably but I'll think twice before I do.
Very bad service!!! I bring my own lemon water, once we chose our seat, they just told us drink from outside is forbidden! And, when we wanna change our seat to the couch, at that time there have two couches available, we asked if we could change to the couch? They said no! Once u chose ur seat, u cannot change! This is the only restaurant doing things so ridiculous I had ever seen before!
I've been to this restaurant twice now, and the experience was just OK. This past time I went I had the boiled dumplings and Singaporean noodles. Now although the dishes are not quite up-to-snuff of things you can find in Flushing, it is one of the better varieties of more "authentic" Chinese cuisine in the Buffalo area. The noodles were tasty, and the portions are generous for the price. It seemed to linger somewhere between single portions and family style. Overall a pleasant food experience. Nothing much I can complain about here because after all, this is Buffalo and not Flushing. My only complaint about this restaurant, similar to other reviews is the service. Although it wasn't down right terrible, it could use some improvement. It was difficult to get the server's attention when we needed a refill on our tea, even though we attempted to flag her down by waving our hands in the air, she acted like she didn't see us and had tunnel vision. Not the most friendly service, but nothing that would really prevent me from coming back. Is the food here worth the not-so-great service? Probably. Simply because there aren't so many restaurants like this in the area. This one is kind of a toss-up for me.
Thankfully didn't have a bad service as warned by other customers (and even my cousin who took us warned us ahead of time that sometimes the service is horrendous here). The waitresses were actually on top of their game this night and refilled my water without me even having to ask. The food was pretty good. A bit on the oily and fattening side (a bit salty also) but otherwise, decent since I don't know this area of China's food that well (I'm from HK). Their spicy dishes can be very spicy just to warn you depending on what you get. We got a pot with fish in it that was super spicy. But I really liked it even if you needed a lot of rice to calm the effect down a bit.
This was totally out of my little world of food. Since normally I have two choices when eating Chinese food... General tso or sweet and sour chicken lol. But we went to live on the edge with taka and friends and I must say all of it was good. Not sure what exactly we ate besides ... General tso chicken and the orange chicken dish. But i think it was pork belly, lamb, and a veggie and shrimp stir fry type dish. Must try very good
I came to Miss Hot Cafe with a group of friends looking to fill our craving for Chinese food and found this restaurant on yelp. The restaurant staff speaks English and Mandarin.  The dishes are pretty legit.  The selection and tastes reminded me of food from back home.  The restaurant itself is very spacy with many booths or tables for large parties as well.  The staff was very attentive and took our orders very quickly.  It is I would avoid the desserts in the display.  Chinese restaurants typically do not make tiramisu, and the staff even admitted that it was from a box.   All in all, I would say one of the better Chinese restaurants I've been to in Buffalo.  The food is good and it's a relaxed environment where you can enjoy your meal with the company of good friends.

I don't spend much time in this neighborhood but since there was a Yelp International Supper Club set up here so I thought I would give it a try. I was there with 6 others. We all ordered our own entrees but the portions were mostly large enough to share with 2 people. I usually go for more adventurous food but I was on a budget today which more or less dictated my choices. I ordered: Pork Egg Roll $1.50 Wonton Soup $4.50 Hong Kong Pan Fried Noodles with chicken $8.95 Just looking at that list, I'll admit, I ordered boring food. But the menu at this place was super large and had some pretty insane things on it which set my expectations pretty high (ex. jellyfish appetizer, frog leg claypot) The Egg Roll was good, it had a lot less cabbage filler in it than a normal one would and I was able to taste the meat. The Wonton Soup was pretty tasteless and standard but it did have about 10 wontons instead of 3 in it. Though, I'm not sure if there was actually anything inside of about half of them. The noodle dish that I ordered was huge but lacked flavor and had very little meat in it. A photo on the menu depicted a version of this with shrimp in it, plated inside a deep round bowl and garnished with a lime. I was expecting the chicken version to be just as beautiful but it did not. (I guess it did come with a ginger flower so that was something, but not at useful as the lime would have been) The service was very strange too. The server was very confused about questions we asked her about the food. She had multiple issues splitting a check when it was a pretty standard request being made. Maybe it was a language barrier? I'm not sure. There's just really nothing that could pull me back into being a customer here.

Don't speak Chinese in this resturant, or you gonna get bully. The owner is a total b*t!  Horrible service! I love the food tho. No-spicy dishes are better than Peking quick one.
I'm from Hunan. The taste of this restaurant is absolutely awesome. It way over my exception and the price is fair.
I've come here a few times and both times were great! The first time I came with Brad and a friend of his. The great thing about getting food with 2 chefs is you know you're going to try the weirdest foods. Thus, we got salt and pepper frog legs, braised pork, and the Shanghai Dumplings. The dumplings were to-die-for! I would definitely get them again. As well as the frog legs. Perfectly breaded and well seasoned. I now am going to order frog legs whenever I see them! I also brought my friend here. She is a little less adventurous. We both ordered the crab ragoon and sesame seed chicken. Another excellent dish! It was easily 3 meals for me! I will definitely come here again!
Very bad service!!! I bring my own lemon water, once we chose our seat, they just told us drink from outside is forbidden! And, when we wanna change our seat to the couch, at that time there have two couches available, we asked if we could change to the couch? They said no! Once u chose ur seat, u cannot change!

The big pot is heaven on Earth. A spicy concoction of well-seasoned chicken, fish and veggies --- served in a cauldron sized pot. The order cost around $15, but you can easily split it between two or even three people. This place serves home style sharing-sized portions of food. The best thing to do is order a few things and share it among your party. When we came here, the waitress was friendly and playful. When I inquired about the frog legs, she told me that "I didn't like look like the frog legs type of guy!" I almost wanted to order them right on the spot. However, I really wasn't feeling them and our table ended up getting the: -Smoked fish This dish was cold with the bones still intact, but most of them were so small you could actually eat them. Enjoyed picking at them -- liked the texture and fish. -Garlic Eggplant Our vegetarian dish to share. Eggplant was soaked in marinade -- soy sauce and veggies. It was a nice stir fry with plenty of eggplant. If you're vegetarian or are looking to eat meatless, definitely consider this. -Big Pot See above, but to reiterate. Oh god. This was huge and heavenly. I wanted to pack the spicy oil/broth home and add more stuff to it after I was done with it, but I was afraid of spilling it in my car. Next time, damn it! Delicious meal and great service. The interior is pretty nice as well. Can't wait to come back!

Terrible service! And it happens every time. we wanted to tip less (from 18% to 15%) because of poor service and they started yelling at us! Wont go again!

Worst restaurant in buffalo. I have a friend who worked there told me they reuse the oil and pepper, so disgusting.  Will not go again.  Unhygienic.

Worst Chinese restaurant in buffalo area. The service is bad. The foods are just ok but overpriced. Much more expensive than Chinese restaurant in flushing. The owner is a jerk who will steal tips from their customer.
They are very rude.  The food is ok but I could not believe how unprofessional the owner and staff are.  I will never return.
Horrible servers !!!!!! if you would like to be yelled  or hotted , just go this restaurant . I can not imaging how this kind of restaurant exits in the word .
Food was on the salty side. The lady at the Casher was very mean ! Make sure you remember the price to everything. They will charge you extra! And if they do there is a Menu on the counter that the Casher will show you that menu is over priced. Don't follow that use another Menu that you ordered from or take a picture of the Menu before you order

Worst service ever! 从服务员到厨师到老板娘个个都太吊，要了一盘宫保鸡丁，鸡块炸的太老。厨师出来说一直这样的。我们每次来都­吃这盘菜真当我们不知道？道歉有那么难吗？好，重做，厨师开始瞎做了，鸡肉是不老了，菜不放酱，没有味道了­，再次沟通希望回锅放点酱，老板娘嗓门很大一直说她没错，是我的错一样，气势汹汹扔了一句没法做，你们退了­吧。 就帮我强制退了呵呵呵。开门做生意还有这样的大开眼界，还有下次最好学一门内部语言骂骂咧咧说上海话我听的­懂ok？（发中文不想歪果仁看笑话）

If I could give zero stars I would.   Arrived on a Saturday afternoon at 3:15.  Sign on the door indicated closed from 3:30 to 4:30.  Was turned away at the door.  Owner said they were at lunch.   Showed her the time on my phone...3:15 0 for hospitality 0 for a welcoming environment 0 for chances I will return.   100 percent chance I will tell anyone thinking of this place not to bother.

This place is no joke! I've waited to post on this restaurant until I had a proper tasting of their menu. What I like the most about Miss Hot Cafe is the friendly atmosphere and service. It must be good if every time I dine in here I'm the only white person in the place, right? My favorite apps are the  Ox tongue & tripe with spicy pepper, Shanghai dumplings and scallion pancake. The ox tongue dish will definitely make you sweat before your meal arrives - make sure you have plenty of water. The dumplings, oh those dumplings, they,re juicy and just plain delicious. The second you bite into them you get an explosion of juicy goodness and the pork inside is so good. Thus far my favorite entrees would have to be the shanghai shrimp, braised pork, and the salt & pepper frog legs. The shrimp is deep fried in the shell and is covered in a garlic and panko bream crumb mixture. Its crunchy, flavorful and cooked to perfection. The braised pork is cooked in some type of BBQ sauce and comes with a deep fried hard boiled egg and sauteed bok choy. If you're feeling froggy then the s&p frog legs might be your thing. They're broken down and two sections of the leg and fried until they are perfectly moist. Do yourself a favor and give Miss Hot Cafe a try

Food was very very salty! Kept drinking water all day long after having lunch here. Service was also sub par. We overheard the lady behind the counter yelling at the customers for being in their way! And when We told them that one of the dishes We had was very dirty, We can see the dirt and stuff (mind you that was after We paid, We just wanted to be nice and Let them be aware of the situation) the first reaction We got from the waitress was "so what do you want?" Our whole table was speechless and looked at each other like seriously? That's all you have to say and that's the first thing you say? So one of us just told them We didn't want anything, just wanted to tell them so they are aware of the situation. Then she walked away. That was one of a kind experience. Never coming back.

The service there is SO BAD. The girl who served us doesn't speak English and had little idea about what was on the menu. When the restaurant first opened, the food was pretty decent. But now it's just getting worse. For the last two times I was there, the dishes were SO salty and obviously they put a lot of MSG in there. I probably would never go back again.

The food is good but because of their service they get 1 star. The marinated gluten is my favorite and the cabbage with chili is good. I came in with 6 people and wanted to sit on the round table instead of the benches near the window and the lady said no. Its for 7 or more people. We had no place settings until after 2 of our dishes came. At the end of the night we wanted to split the bill part cash and part credit. The lady cashier was basically yelling at my friend. I would come back for the food but only for take out.
Worst Chinese restaurant in Buffalo. The service is so bad! Never come to this restaurant!
I came home for Thanksgiving break and my mom took me to this restaurant. We got the Kung Pao chicken, the sauteed string beans and this dish with veggies, fish, shrimp, pork in hot chili oil. The sauteed string beans were really good! The string beans were fresh and the flavor was great. I love ordering this dish and I think this is my favorite. The Kung Pao chicken was equally tasty. What I didn't like was the dish in the hot chili oil. The flavor was really off and tasted weird. I couldn't really place what it was. The fish was also falling apart and the shrimp are those baby shrimps. I was not a huge fan of this dish! Service and atmosphere are what you'd expect at a Chinese restaurant!

If you don't mind eating dishes with the same spices/sauces, then you might enjoy this spot. It is incredibly spicy, I think just about every dish here is spicy except the eggplant with garlic sauce(best dish here). Relatively expensive compared to Quick One but more convenient/cleaner. Whatever you do, just don't order the pepper beef. My friends and I had to look for the beef since it was covered in peppers, it was so skimped.

Good food here (4 stars) is awesome but in a restaurant service and attitude makes up the other half. Got kicked out three times from this shop just because they wanted to close earlier. Shop clearly has sign at the door that the store closes at 10pm and the open sign was still lit but reach there at 9pm and got shouted at that they are closed. They closes the shop any time they want and does not respect other people's time. Would be a great restaurant if the owner was much more welcoming and professional.

Oh my goodness, where have you BEEN these past few years, Miss Hot Cafe?? Ever since moving to Buffalo, I've longed for the Chinese food of yore, classic staple dishes cooked up or stir-fried in the way only a high-heat, Chinese restaurant wok can. Some restaurants have come close - May Jen has fairly authentic dishes, and Kung Food offers some solid Taiwanese style eats - but none have been able to evoke the warm fuzzies that dining in a sit-down Chinese restaurant brings me quite the way Miss Hot Cafe does. I think it's a combination of atmosphere, taste, and the nice owner lady! First off, the menu is classic, from its presentation to the menu items themselves.  It is hand written, with notes jotted down in some sections and dishes crossed out with red pen in others. One section isn't even in English, but don't let that deter you, just ask and the staff are glad to help! It is divided into soups, small sides, different meats, veggies, and specials, and it offers everything you'd expect, from scallion pancake and dumplings, to game and seafood, to various tofu dishes, to veggies. You won't find an overabundance of fried rice or stir fried noodle specials here; Miss Hot Cafe's menu highlights a separate main ingredient in each dish, meant to be eaten over white rice. And tea and rice are on the house, just the way it should be! Food tastes excellent. Unlike a lot of other Chinese places I've been to in Buffalo, each dish has unique flavor. Their ingredients are also very authentic - bamboo shoots, wood ear, chili peppers, and scallions accompany the main proteins with not a wayward bell pepper, water chestnut, or baby corn to be found! My friend and I have had the crispy lamb, string beans, family tofu, scallion pancake, and Sichuan tofu soup so far, and I am pleased to say that we loved every single dish. On top of everything, the owner lady is SUPER nice, and service is excellent!! N.B. This is a family style sit down restaurant, and it's reflected in the portion sizes. Best way to eat here is to come with a party of 4 or more, order one dish per person, and share! You'll definitely get your fill, plus some food leftover. Of course, you can do what I did, too: come with a friend, order 4 mains between the two of us, and eat like there's no tomorrow. N.B. #2 (for vegetarians): As with most Chinese places, just cause a dish is listed under the "vegetable" section, doesn't mean it's vegetarian. "Vegetable dish" literally just means that the main ingredient is a vegetable. That said, if you ask them not to add meat, they will gladly accommodate. I can personally attest that flavor is not compromised.
The service there is SO BAD. The girl who served us doesn't speak English and had little idea about what was on the menu. When the restaurant first opened, the food was pretty decent. But now it's just getting worse. For the last two times I was there, the dishes were SO salty and obviously they put a lot of MSG in there. I probably would never go back again.
Another excellent Asian eatery in this area of town makes me happy. Not only was the food delicious but the service was friendly, funny, and accommodating. Plus you know you're in good hands when all tables aside from your table is occupied by Asians. We ordered a ton of food to split between the 4 of us. My family is not adventurous at all so we mostly ordered off of the front part of the menu, aside from the Hong Kong Noodles I got. We ordered egg roll, spring roll, won ton soup, crab rangoon, Hong Kong noodles (with chicken), sweet and sour chicken, pepper steak with onion, and finally Kung Pao chicken. Everything was excellent and not at all greasy or overpowering. The spring rolls were crispy and tasty. The Rangoon was crispy and I loved the real crab but they were a little sweet for my taste. The won ton soup was my favorite in WNY. The dumplings in it seem homemade. Much lighter won ton than most heavy dough won tons. Plus, there was more than enough for 4 people to share. It was a huge portion. I loved that! Yum yum yum. I want more. Haha! The main dishes were awesome. Hong Kong noodles were great and made without celery as I requested. The pepper steak was probably my favorite of the night. Thin sliced, tender beef, fresh peppers and onions, perfectly cooked with great consistency. My mom said she loved it because it wasn't "slimy". I know exactly what she's talking about... It was so good! The Kung Pao was actually really good too! I don't normally love this dish because of all of the celery used in it but this was so good. Chicken was probably thigh meat but wasn't fatty. It was very good and had a great flavor. The sweet and sour chicken (basically chicken nuggets) I could have done without but it's my sister's favorite. My compliments are that the fried coating was really crispy and light. Not thick like at some places. And the chicken was good quality white meat. The meal was completed with a plate of sliced kiwi and fortune cookies. And tons of leftovers and full bellies. I can't wait to come back and try more menu items! Maybe the next time I will come with more adventurous eaters...
The food is good but because of their service they get 1 star. The marinated gluten is my favorite and the cabbage with chili is good. I came in with 6 people and wanted to sit on the round table instead of the benches near the window and the lady said no. Its for 7 or more people. We had no place settings until after 2 of our dishes came. At the end of the night we wanted to split the bill part cash and part credit. The lady cashier was basically yelling at my friend. I would come back for the food but only for take out.
Pretty decent Chinese restaurant for buffalo. Definitely do not up to San Francisco's standard. Have authentic Chinese good at the back if the menu. Service was pretty good. Tea was lukewarm instead of hot. Pretty busy place.
I came home for Thanksgiving break and my mom took me to this restaurant. We got the Kung Pao chicken, the sauteed string beans and this dish with veggies, fish, shrimp, pork in hot chili oil. The sauteed string beans were really good! The string beans were fresh and the flavor was great. I love ordering this dish and I think this is my favorite. The Kung Pao chicken was equally tasty. What I didn't like was the dish in the hot chili oil. The flavor was really off and tasted weird. I couldn't really place what it was. The fish was also falling apart and the shrimp are those baby shrimps. I was not a huge fan of this dish! Service and atmosphere are what you'd expect at a Chinese restaurant!
How this place doesn't get 5 stars surprises me. On their dim sum menu alone it is a can't miss. They have a really expansive menu with things you won't find at the corner chinese joint in your neighborhood. Good service, excellent food, probably the most authentic place in the region by far. The other great thing is the amount of food you get for the price. You'll leave sated and content without the msg hangover from other places.
If you don't mind eating dishes with the same spices/sauces, then you might enjoy this spot. It is incredibly spicy, I think just about every dish here is spicy except the eggplant with garlic sauce(best dish here). Relatively expensive compared to Quick One but more convenient/cleaner. Whatever you do, just don't order the pepper beef. My friends and I had to look for the beef since it was covered in peppers, it was so skimped.
I should have given more than 3 stars for their food, but I only give 1 for their horrible service. I'm not saying customers should be taken as god, at least show me some respect please! Don't be extremely pride!
Good food here (4 stars) is awesome but in a restaurant service and attitude makes up the other half. Got kicked out three times from this shop just because they wanted to close earlier. Shop clearly has sign at the door that the store closes at 10pm and the open sign was still lit but reach there at 9pm and got shouted at that they are closed. They closes the shop any time they want and does not respect other people's time. Would be a great restaurant if the owner was much more welcoming and professional.
awesome food been there several times and haven't been let down. They are consistent and have a very polite and knowledgeable staff. The décor is a bit off kind of a buffet feel, I really don't mind since the food and my company is what I am enjoying. check this place out and try the crispy potato they are not what they seem. The  comment by V.R. is true and they should perhaps not post that they are closed between 3:30 to 4:30 that will turn customers off. We had no problem being served at 4 p.m. they did mention it was their lunch time which at the time I was unaware they were closed. The owner was a bit peeved but they did serve us and as always it was yummy.
Oh my goodness, where have you BEEN these past few years, Miss Hot Cafe?? Ever since moving to Buffalo, I've longed for the Chinese food of yore, classic staple dishes cooked up or stir-fried in the way only a high-heat, Chinese restaurant wok can. Some restaurants have come close - May Jen has fairly authentic dishes, and Kung Food offers some solid Taiwanese style eats - but none have been able to evoke the warm fuzzies that dining in a sit-down Chinese restaurant brings me quite the way Miss Hot Cafe does. I think it's a combination of atmosphere, taste, and the nice owner lady! First off, the menu is classic, from its presentation to the menu items themselves.  It is hand written, with notes jotted down in some sections and dishes crossed out with red pen in others. One section isn't even in English, but don't let that deter you, just ask and the staff are glad to help! It is divided into soups, small sides, different meats, veggies, and specials, and it offers everything you'd expect, from scallion pancake and dumplings, to game and seafood, to various tofu dishes, to veggies. You won't find an overabundance of fried rice or stir fried noodle specials here; Miss Hot Cafe's menu highlights a separate main ingredient in each dish, meant to be eaten over white rice. And tea and rice are on the house, just the way it should be! Food tastes excellent. Unlike a lot of other Chinese places I've been to in Buffalo, each dish has unique flavor. Their ingredients are also very authentic - bamboo shoots, wood ear, chili peppers, and scallions accompany the main proteins with not a wayward bell pepper, water chestnut, or baby corn to be found! My friend and I have had the crispy lamb, string beans, family tofu, scallion pancake, and Sichuan tofu soup so far, and I am pleased to say that we loved every single dish. On top of everything, the owner lady is SUPER nice, and service is excellent!! N.B. This is a family style sit down restaurant, and it's reflected in the portion sizes. Best way to eat here is to come with a party of 4 or more, order one dish per person, and share! You'll definitely get your fill, plus some food leftover. Of course, you can do what I did, too: come with a friend, order 4 mains between the two of us, and eat like there's no tomorrow. N.B. #2 (for vegetarians): As with most Chinese places, just cause a dish is listed under the "vegetable" section, doesn't mean it's vegetarian. "Vegetable dish" literally just means that the main ingredient is a vegetable. That said, if you ask them not to add meat, they will gladly accommodate.

I don't know how to put it better than to say that I had lunch at Miss Hot Café, and I enjoyed what I ate. That being said, I don't know if what I ate what was I ordered, to be certain - though it was delicious and prepared well. Echoing previous comments about this seemingly being a family run shop, it looked like they had one waiter, one cook, and one person managing the place at the time. The waiter was clearly overwhelmed with the situation to some degree, and the orders ended up a big jumbled up as a result. It took him a long time to come back to the table with the bill afterwards, but, that's just him, the food was otherwise good. Had what I presume was the double-sautéed pork, the spring roll, and the crab Rangoon. They were a bit on the sweet side for my preference, but absolutely were good and didn't taste like the usual buffet fodder. The pork dish was great, bit of heat, it was something I'd try again for sure. They had a liquor license posted up but I didn't see anything advertising beer or wine, though they may have it, or might soon. While there are a number of $6 Asian lunch special places nearby this area, which may prompt you to overlook this restaurant, the menu was extensive with a number of things I've not seen nor had before, which makes it worth stopping in - as long as you understand they're still clearly just getting in order.

This inconspicuous little restaurant with a quirky name off the side of the road in a small plaza, is full of character and big flavors. You definitely don't want to miss this one. I went to Miss Hot Cafe simply based off a recommendation from a friend regarding their egg tarts (which are absolutely delicious, but only offered on the weekends). Feeling adventurous, my small group of amazing friends (Jenna, Danny, and Victor) and I went to Miss Hot Cafe on a whim. While I am Chinese and grew up on chinese food, I am still not entirely fluent with most Chinese menus, especially due to my inability to read chinese, and lets be honest, the english translations are not always the best to go by. Luckily the waiter was extremely nice and comical. He really made our dining experience enjoyable by  recommending great dishes, explaining every aspect of the menu and ingredients/preparations of various dishes. He even brought out a little sample of a soup he recommended, even though we had decided to go with a different dish. The portion sizes were definitely meant for family style sharing - after the food came out, we immediately realized we had ordered far too much. The quality of of the food was very good, with very full flavor profiles that was balanced well, neither too bland or too salty as you may find in many asian restaurants. They offer dim sum plates all day and every day of the week. If you like spicy food, they definitely have a wide selection of spicy foods as well. They also have a wide range of clay pot dishes. For desert, they have a rice wine soup with sticky rice balls as well as the egg tart. As opposed to many of chinese take-out restaurants around (some with great food like Uncle John's and some bad), this place is definitely meant as a sit down restaurant - although they also offer take-out but their take-out menu has not been finalized yet. As a side tip: if you plan on using a card, it is a $15 dollar minimum per card All in all, the company, service, quality of food, and atmosphere were great. And, as for the egg tart I came specifically for, it was delicious.

Love this place..so good.
Had kind of a strange experience the second time I ate there. As I walked in I was greeted by a young boy that was probably about 10 years old and apparently hosting. He took me to my table and asked if I wanted 'cold water' or 'hot tea'. It was kind of cute. After I got my water I waited for about 10 mins before the waitress came over, which I thought was a bit annoying. But, it turns out that there was only one waitress and she couldn't have been older than 15. It's obvious that this place is run by an extended family with no outside help. With that said she was very polite and did a pretty decent job considering that there were probably 30 diners across 10 or so tables. As for the food, not impressed this time around. I ordered the Double Sautéed pork which sounded delicious but, fell way short of my expectations. It came with a spicy sauce with cabbage, scallion and some sort of black beans. The dish was too salty and the pork was thin strips of flimsy pork belly. Too much fat and it had a rubbery texture. Along with that I had wonton soup and fried rice. Both tasted pretty typical, nothing really surprising there. I was disappointed because, I was there during their grand opening week and the food was great. Except for the stale 'not so' crispy noodles, the General Tso's was great. Nice and spicy, good texture and without gobs of that gooey sauce that most places put on it. Oh well, maybe it will be better next time. Yes, I will go back, mainly because they have some menu items that you don't typically see on your standard chinese menu. Things like tongue and tripe, sea cucumber, frog and a bunch of different fish items. Other than that I like the atmosphere, it has kind of a retro feel. The place was spotless, no worries about cleanliness there. It was a little loud, there were a lot of what looked like college kids there but, it wasn't obnoxious. I think this would be a great place to go with a group of people. Good place to check out.
Easily the best Chinese food I've ever had! I've tried just about anything they have to offer and I can honestly say I would not rate anything less than 5 stars! The waitresses are knowledgeable and friendly. The owner/ cashier is a bit eccentric but still friendly. All the food is served in family style portions and everything is spiced absolutely perfect. I can't say enough about this place. I literally take every person I know here as often as possible!
This one is truly awesome!!! I am pretty sure that this one would be a famous restaurant even in Beijing, China!! Even though I am a picky diner, I am satisfied with their food. Whoever you are, you deserve a try!!! --------------------------------------------------­------------ Honestly, you may need to wait for a long time...
Oh Miss Hot why did you have to open in the same plaza as Jin JIn?  I felt I was cheating on my favorite Chinese restaurant as I entered.  However, I have to jump on the chance of anything new here in Buffalo.  I was not disappointed.  My wife ordered the vegetarian duck.  I tried a bite; the flavor was amazing...the texture was just a little to weird to me but she loved it.   I loved their sweet n sour sauce.  Though it did wear on the tongue a bit because it kinda tastes like strawberry jam.  The crap ragoons were amazing! Seriously!  Real Crab! Most places use imitation crab.  I also ordered the beef noodle soup. I will warn you. Its authentic - meaning wonderful bits of chewy fat still attached to the chunks of beef..maybe a little tendon...but that's what gives it it's flavor. I did go to Jin Jin's afterwords for a bubble tea.  Overall Miss Hot Café is worth a trip to give them a try. They are reasonably priced, service was good and the place is very cute.
I'm drenched in sweat, my eyes are tearing, my face is bright red, my tongue is throbbing and I CAN'T STOP EATING!!!  I decided to start with a snippet removed from mid-review as it truly describes the wonderfully cleansing eating experience at Miss Hot Cafe, the greatest thing to happen to Amherst, New York since Satish Mohan (much love Satish...much love). Miss Hot Cafe is a brand new Shanghaiese and Sichaun restaurant offering a wide variety of traditional fare.  With that said, as your review the menu, please skip through the first few pages as they are meant for the ignorant gwai lo.  (Though I too am gwai lo...I'd like to consider myself not of the ignorant variety).  As you begin to peruse the wonderful variety of cold appetizers, it is clear that this place is unique. Other restaurants in town offer traditional fare like Peking Quick One and Gin Gin.  However, this menu is by far the most extensive on Traditional fare, most approachable to the non-Mandarin reading diner, and the interior/tables are really nice and clean (unlike the aforementioned).  You've probably heard rumors of the secret Chinese menu, written in hanzi and completely unavailable to the average Westerner, unless of course they've implanted a Babel fish.  Well times have changed and Miss Hot Cafe has completely incorporated the secret Chinese menu and revels in its glory.   To give you an idea of the rarity of the offerings let us start with the cold marinated gluten.  Gluten is similar to (if not the same thing as) seitan in texture (like a chewy and porous bread).  They take gluten, marinade it in (black vinegar, soy and oil? I'm guessing here) and serve it with peanuts and black fungus.  Highly recommended as a unique and great starter to cool your palate for the hot intensity that is yet to come.  I tried to order the cold marinaded duck (for my 8 year old (turning 9 this week...he made me write that) dining companion who adamantly believes that one can not enjoy a Chinese meal without some duck on the table), but they were out of it that evening. Loving Sichuan cuisine, and rarely enjoying such fare locally, I decided to indulge in the spicy dishes.  To save the little fella from gastro-intestinal torture I ordered him some Hong Kong Noodles (which were quite delicious).  I indulged in Crispy Lamb, stir fried string beans, and the pièce de résistance: the shredded beef in chili oil. The Crispy Lamb came out first and was not crispy (that was not a problem).  It was a spicy stir fried lamb with cumin seeds and a lot of chilis.  There was definitely an Indian influence on this dish, and it was spectacular.  The flavor of the lamb was not overpowered by the strong and generous use of spice.  This dish was hot, but was nothing compared to what would follow. Next up was the "Vegetarian" Stir-fried string beans (with minced salted pork).  This is one of my favorite dishes only served locally at Golden Duck.  The pork was not as salty as Golden Duck's, which was fine with me, but it was certainly much spicier.  This is one of those ideal dishes that combine fresh crunchy string beans only lightly fried, which are balanced and salted with...wait for it...meat.  I love it.  Ingenious.  Suck it vegetarians...another win for the carnivores. Now for the star of the evening, a buxom, operatic diva who's splendor is only rivaled by her spine tingling skill.  The star of this evening was the shredded beef served in a rich, deeply spicy broth of chili oil (can you call it broth when it is only oil and rendered beef fat?), with a health smattering of whole hot chilis, cilantro and Asian cabbage (almost like a non-fermented Kim Chi).  What makes this dish phenomenal is that it is so over the top.  The beef is basically cooked in hot chili oil (a LOT of very hot, deep red chili oil).  Think of the French technique of confit only take out the refrigerating in its own fat for a week.  Instead of deep frying the meat, the oil makes the meat super soft and tender, imbuing it with additional tongue searing heat and savory fat.  It was amazing...and made me pour out sweat.  The hot broth had me inhaling searing chili fumes which turned me into a tearing mess.  My wee dining companion could not help but laugh at me in my disheveled state.  Keep this in mind, that this is certainly not a good spot for a date night or even a night with a wee dining companion, unless of course you like being ridiculed by an 8 year old (turning 9 this week...again he made me write that).     I was so impressed with this meal (and ridiculously high on serotonin and endorphins after eating all of those chilis) that I basically raved about the food to the waiter (to the point he started to back away from the table) and told him this was my new favorite local restaurant.  I've never said that on a first visit, perhaps that alone speaks volumes.  Try out Miss Hot Cafe, bring your towel and don't panic. So long and thanks for all the fish.

It taste very bad. I remember we order the frog, the frog is so wired which seems like died several days. And the attitude of server is very bad. She even do not want to admit the bad the stink frog. We Just ask to switch another order. She just told us it is almost closed. I clearly remember it is 9pm at that time. If the store says open until 10pm, why the store stop service at 9? Never come to this store ever. WORSE restaurant in Buffalo!
Easily the best Chinese food I've ever had! I've tried just about anything they have to offer and I can honestly say I would not rate anything less than 5 stars! The waitresses are knowledgeable and friendly. The owner/ cashier is a bit eccentric but still friendly. All the food is served in family style portions and everything is spiced absolutely perfect. I can't say enough about this place. I literally take every person I know here as often as possible!
I'll never get beyond their Braised Pork lunch special. So I apologize for basing the review on just one entree, even though I'm a regular customer. I wish that I could sample some of their other tempting dishes, but this one always pulls me back in. It's not just the scrumptiously layered squares of pork belly. It's the mystery of the peeled hard-boiled egg that accompanies it. How do they get the inside surface to change color like that? One day I'll have to ask them. They also do bok choy right, so I definitely get my green leafies when I go there. Miss Hot, you are one hot Chinese dish.
This one is truly awesome!!! I am pretty sure that this one would be a famous restaurant even in Beijing, China!! Even though I am a picky diner, I am satisfied with their food. Whoever you are, you deserve a try!!! --------------------------------------------------­------------ Honestly, you may need to wait for a long time...
I was recommended to check out Miss Hot Cafe by a friend who loves Szechuan style food. Being Thai, I thought nothing of the spice level and my boyfriend and I headed there around 9:30pm on a Saturday night. The outside doesn't reflect the interior decor- which was spacious, yet clean and quaint. By the time we ordered our food, we were the only customers left. The recommendation was to order the braised pork, but we also ordered a side of shumai and jelly fish and a bottle of milk tea. We were aware of how spicy the pork was going to be (as indicated), however we didn't know it was going to be THAT SPICY. It got to a point where it was slightly uncomfortable and we asked if there was anything they could do to make it less spicy. Overall, they did accommodate us, but charged $1 more for the remake. Although the jellyfish was quite spicy, it was quite good. It was crunchy and seemed like it was homemade. The shumai, however was plain and was obviously frozen. They staff mainly spoke mandarin, but were plenty kind to us. Overall, we might decide to go again to checkout the non spicy foods, however it was just too spicy for us both.

I did go to Jin Jin's afterwords for a bubble tea.  Overall Miss Hot Café is worth a trip to give them a try. They are reasonably priced, service was good and the place is very cute.
Good taste and good service! We went there twice, and ordered different kinds of dishes, all of them are recommended. You can find Sichuan food, Shanghai food as well as Cantonese food in this restaurant. You need to try it. Recommended to Chinese people!
I'm drenched in sweat, my eyes are tearing, my face is bright red, my tongue is throbbing and I CAN'T STOP EATING!!!  I decided to start with a snippet removed from mid-review as it truly describes the wonderfully cleansing eating experience at Miss Hot Cafe, the greatest thing to happen to Amherst, New York since Satish Mohan (much love Satish...much love). Miss Hot Cafe is a brand new Shanghaiese and Sichaun restaurant offering a wide variety of traditional fare.  With that said, as your review the menu, please skip through the first few pages as they are meant for the ignorant gwai lo.  (Though I too am gwai lo...I'd like to consider myself not of the ignorant variety).  As you begin to peruse the wonderful variety of cold appetizers, it is clear that this place is unique. Other restaurants in town offer traditional fare like Peking Quick One and Gin Gin.  However, this menu is by far the most extensive on Traditional fare, most approachable to the non-Mandarin reading diner, and the interior/tables are really nice and clean (unlike the aforementioned).  You've probably heard rumors of the secret Chinese menu, written in hanzi and completely unavailable to the average Westerner, unless of course they've implanted a Babel fish.  Well times have changed and Miss Hot Cafe has completely incorporated the secret Chinese menu and revels in its glory.   To give you an idea of the rarity of the offerings let us start with the cold marinated gluten.  Gluten is similar to (if not the same thing as) seitan in texture (like a chewy and porous bread).  They take gluten, marinade it in (black vinegar, soy and oil? I'm guessing here) and serve it with peanuts and black fungus.  Highly recommended as a unique and great starter to cool your palate for the hot intensity that is yet to come.  I tried to order the cold marinaded duck (for my 8 year old (turning 9 this week...he made me write that) dining companion who adamantly believes that one can not enjoy a Chinese meal without some duck on the table), but they were out of it that evening. Loving Sichuan cuisine, and rarely enjoying such fare locally, I decided to indulge in the spicy dishes.  To save the little fella from gastro-intestinal torture I ordered him some Hong Kong Noodles (which were quite delicious).  I indulged in Crispy Lamb, stir fried string beans, and the pièce de résistance: the shredded beef in chili oil. The Crispy Lamb came out first and was not crispy (that was not a problem).  It was a spicy stir fried lamb with cumin seeds and a lot of chilis.  There was definitely an Indian influence on this dish, and it was spectacular.  The flavor of the lamb was not overpowered by the strong and generous use of spice.  This dish was hot, but was nothing compared to what would follow. Next up was the "Vegetarian" Stir-fried string beans (with minced salted pork).  This is one of my favorite dishes only served locally at Golden Duck.  The pork was not as salty as Golden Duck's, which was fine with me, but it was certainly much spicier.  This is one of those ideal dishes that combine fresh crunchy string beans only lightly fried, which are balanced and salted with...wait for it...meat.  I love it.  Ingenious.  Suck it vegetarians...another win for the carnivores. Now for the star of the evening, a buxom, operatic diva who's splendor is only rivaled by her spine tingling skill.  The star of this evening was the shredded beef served in a rich, deeply spicy broth of chili oil (can you call it broth when it is only oil and rendered beef fat?), with a health smattering of whole hot chilis, cilantro and Asian cabbage (almost like a non-fermented Kim Chi).  What makes this dish phenomenal is that it is so over the top.  The beef is basically cooked in hot chili oil (a LOT of very hot, deep red chili oil).  Think of the French technique of confit only take out the refrigerating in its own fat for a week.  Instead of deep frying the meat, the oil makes the meat super soft and tender, imbuing it with additional tongue searing heat and savory fat.  It was amazing...and made me pour out sweat.  The hot broth had me inhaling searing chili fumes which turned me into a tearing mess.  My wee dining companion could not help but laugh at me in my disheveled state.  Keep this in mind, that this is certainly not a good spot for a date night or even a night with a wee dining companion, unless of course you like being ridiculed by an 8 year old (turning 9 this week...again he made me write that).     I was so impressed with this meal (and ridiculously high on serotonin and endorphins after eating all of those chilis) that I basically raved about the food to the waiter (to the point he started to back away from the table) and told him this was my new favorite local restaurant.  I've never said that on a first visit, perhaps that alone speaks volumes.  Try out Miss Hot Cafe, bring your towel and don't panic. So long and thanks for all the fish.
Miss Hot Cafe is awesome! We went on opening day and instantly knew this was going to be a regular stop for great Chinese. The veggie dumplings and the veggie spring rolls are especially awesome. We're not vegetarians, but we could easily make a meal out of all the awesome veggie dishes. The Szechuan Beef is great if you are looking for meat. (Seriously, get the veggie dumplings)
It taste very bad. I remember we order the frog, the frog is so wired which seems like died several days. And the attitude of server is very bad. She even do not want to admit the bad the stink frog. We Just ask to switch another order. She just told us it is almost closed. I clearly remember it is 9pm at that time. If the store says open until 10pm, why the store stop service at 9? Never come to this store ever. WORSE restaurant in Buffalo!
Finally found a keeper in buffalo! Asian food in buffalo has always been a let down, but so glad my husband found this place for Chinese New Year.  Really have no idea why it received low ratings because the food was actually really good. All our dishes were flavorful with great spice. The hot oil Szechuan dishes are not our thing ( just a preference, nothing against the restaurant) but all the non hot oil dishes were awesome! We started with the jelly fish. Crunchy, spicy, with a hint of sesame oil.  The eggplant with garlic sauce was not greasy, and our sweet and sour fish pot with udon hit the spot on a cold night. Staff was very friendly, attentive, and very fast. Restaurant was clean and inviting. The owner reminds me of my mom, loud, Chinese,  and in charge. Would definitely go back.
I'll never get beyond their Braised Pork lunch special. So I apologize for basing the review on just one entree, even though I'm a regular customer. I wish that I could sample some of their other tempting dishes, but this one always pulls me back in. It's not just the scrumptiously layered squares of pork belly. It's the mystery of the peeled hard-boiled egg that accompanies it. How do they get the inside surface to change color like that? One day I'll have to ask them. They also do bok choy right, so I definitely get my green leafies when I go there. Miss Hot, you are one hot Chinese dish.
I have been to Miss Hot twice in the last month.  I ordered the General Tsao chicken both times and it was very good.  However my husband ordered the sweet and sour chicken and the sauce is not what we are used to.  It tasted like cherry juice.  We did not like it.   The servers were very nice however on both occassions the food came out at different times.  I was done eating my dinner before my husband's food even came out.  This also happened the first time I was there with a group.  Everyone got their orders at different times.
I was recommended to check out Miss Hot Cafe by a friend who loves Szechuan style food. Being Thai, I thought nothing of the spice level and my boyfriend and I headed there around 9:30pm on a Saturday night. The outside doesn't reflect the interior decor- which was spacious, yet clean and quaint. By the time we ordered our food, we were the only customers left. The recommendation was to order the braised pork, but we also ordered a side of shumai and jelly fish and a bottle of milk tea. We were aware of how spicy the pork was going to be (as indicated), however we didn't know it was going to be THAT SPICY. It got to a point where it was slightly uncomfortable and we asked if there was anything they could do to make it less spicy. Overall, they did accommodate us, but charged $1 more for the remake. Although the jellyfish was quite spicy, it was quite good. It was crunchy and seemed like it was homemade. The shumai, however was plain and was obviously frozen. They staff mainly spoke mandarin, but were plenty kind to us. Overall, we might decide to go again to checkout the non spicy foods, however it was just too spicy for us both.
Finally they opened a Shanghainese place! I love the traditional food, feels like im at home! I love the pork shoulder and and winter melon soup ! Make sure you try the big pot as well, its not Shanghainese but its definitely worth a try! But only if you like spicy!
Good taste and good service! We went there twice, and ordered different kinds of dishes, all of them are recommended. You can find Sichuan food, Shanghai food as well as Cantonese food in this restaurant. You need to try it. Recommended to Chinese people!
Our 4-top was so excited to try this highly recommend brand new Asian restaurant! Arriving on a Saturday night the atmosphere was buzzing; the waitresses looked flustered and required prodding to be seated. After a 10 minute conversation at our table, we had to find our own menus. The standard crabmeat rangoons were a delight with a vegetable egg roll pairing. The dumplings were also pleasing. The potato strips were severely under cooked, but we were of course willing to look to the entrees on the horizon. The Ma Po tofu was also undercooked and has the consistency of runny eggs. I'm sure the dish would have been great if the tofu was up to par. After trying to stomach the tofu, which had added meat, we all found comfort in the traditional dish of over-cooked chicken lo mein. We had enough time to write this yelp review from the time we never received menus to the time we never received the check.

This place is worth every bit of 4 stars and then some! The Crispy Lamb dish was fantastic and the traditional American Chinese dishes were great too. They make their dumplings fresh in the restaurant and you can tell. They're the best I've ever had! The pork fried rice is something to write home about and the presentation of all of these dishes was great! Love this place and I plan on eating here anytime I'm in the vicinity!

Miss Hot Cafe is a welcome addition to the Buffalo Chinese food scene. As a Chinese person from Sichuan, I have to put myself in the fairly picky category, and the food at Miss Hot satisfied. The owners are both from Shanghai and I would recommend everything Shanghainese on their menu. The decor is fairly modern and everything is very clean. Everything was tasty, fresh and served in very respectable portions. I would recommend the Shanghai smoked duck and braised pork belly. Their Sichuan dishes were yummy but not quite right on the spices. If you want more authentic Sichuanese food, go to China Star on Sheridan where the chef is from Sichuan - they have a special menu. Would definitely invite my friends here, waiting to try their dim sum on another occasion :).
