I am updating my review since I went back for spa services. I had a glycolic treatment facial and it was awesome. My skin felt lush and moisturized for many days to follow and I received so many compliments on my complexion following my treatment. The room was really clean, quiet and I felt so relaxed and comfortable there. I would definitely recommend their skin services to anyone, I wish I were able to treat myself more often! It made such a huge difference in my skin complexion and condition. I will definitely be going again!

Marla always does a fabulous job with my hair. The salon assistants are always very sweet as well & the salon is always clean. Having coffee or tea by the color station is also super nice to have while waiting...it's the simple things :)

Not sure why others rated so low. The salon spa is very clean and inviting. It has a unique layout, which I like. The staff are friendly and very knowledgeable. There aren't many high-end spas in Dutchess County (I've been to them all now), and Marlene Weber is one of the best. Their prices are competitive (and cheaper than Westchester salons). My only complaint is with the receptionists. In person, they are charming and helpful. However, when you call they always seem annoyed, rushed, or rude. Other, than that, I really enjoy this spa. Bring cash for tips.

Overall the service was good with a few snafus and the appearance and cleanliness of the spa was better then most. When we arrived early to the salon (at their request)  they were unprepared for us and a litlle disorganized for a party of 7 gals, and said they never had a bridal party that was on time before. We didn't actually get started for a good half hour to 45 mins late, which is frustrating when you're on a schedule. Lori did my hair and make up for my wedding and I was more then pleased. She did exactly as I asked and everything was perfect.  The other girls in my bridal party were very happy with their stylists/make up artists. The spa over charged me for gratuity but were quick to refund my money. I also had a mani pedi there the day before which was very relaxing, so I highly reccommend their other services.   I probably won't be going back only because I don't live in the area.

My experience was definitely meh.  I came in for a glycolic peel and an eyebrow waxing.  The technician was extremely knowledgeable.  The facial itself was magnificent BUT the eyebrow waxing was a different story.  She did the waxing first and she ripped off skin underneath my eyebrow!  The wax was not hot and I do not use any skincare products besides moisturizer and sunscreen.  This should not be happening for $20 and it took about 2 weeks to heal.  I tried this spa on a whim and I probably won't be back.

My sister and I went for a spa day visit and had a terrific time. The spa is spacious, nicely decorated and very clean. They were very helpful on the phone making the appointments, and texted the day before to confirm. We were greeted warmly and brought to the changing area and then their waiting area. Our appointments started on time and we agreed the massage therapists  were both fantastic. Then we had our facials and we enjoyed both of those. My sister got the glycolic peel and was especially pleased with Sara. We were brought upstairs for our side by side pedicures and relaxed with champagne. The two young women were very personable and did a great job. The four of us chatted and the time flew by. Since there were no customers waiting, they had us relax in place with our champagne and talk as long as we wanted.  Check out was easy and smooth.  We also liked the location as it was easy to get a bite to eat right there.

This spa was ok. I went with my Mom for her 50th birthday about 2 years agao and we had a side by side massage. The worker at the desk was very short but the women doing our treatments were lovely. We had a snack and a neck wrap, hand treatment and foot treatment before the massage. My Mom really enjoyed the day which was the most important thing but the massage really wasn't good. Pressure was way too light. I think the "Meh. I've experienced better" is a good description for my experience. My Mom has been there a couple more times and keeps just saying it was ok.

Upscale type atmosphere for the poughkeepsie area. Get Harry if you go for a massage - he is amazing! I have been there a few times and ever since I got him I would never go to anyone else there. Pedicures are nice there too but I think their other services are over priced for what they are. Only issue I have ever had is that once when I went for a massage the table was shaky/ uneven. The masseuse apologized and did his best to steady the table during the service - wasn't his fault the table was broken. I should have said something to the front desk people but I didn't.

Great service! Great atmosphere and very efficient customer service' I've been reading reviews about this place and I was very surprised when my expectations were more than fulfilled. I'm very skeptical about trying new places specially because I've been always trusting specific places in manhattan and always getting satisfying results. I went to Marlene Weber for a up do and a make up. As a guest of a wedding my only request was to look good but not in a very dramatic way (it was not my wedding after all), the result was fabulous and I'm sure coming back - with friends if possible. I scheduled my appointment online and even though many people are complaining about their system it was very efficient and worked great for me (I rather do it online, no time at all to be on the phone) - I got a confirmation by email with the time they could take, the name of professionals assisting me and the approximate time I'd be leaving the salon! What else can you ask for? Stephanie did my hair and everyone I met that night was very impressed about it, Sara did my make up and let's just say I wish I could see her every week! Thank you for the entire team at Marlene Webber! And for the ones looking for advice: it's a must go!
