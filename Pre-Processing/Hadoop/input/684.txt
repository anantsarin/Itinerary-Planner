Joining this place is like no other gym! Motivation abounds all around you. Everything can be scaled so you can be in a class with beginners to Â competitive athletes. Have a question? Ask the coach for whatever your concern, from technique to mobility to diet, they'll try to help you. Do try out the specialty classes they offer because it's just as challenging as the workout of the day (WOD). Lots of community involvement too from monthly activities to competitive events to charity events. Give it a shot! If you are looking for a challenge & want to get/stay fit & healthy, join CCP!
I joined Crossfit because I was bored with my workouts and wanted to try something new. When I walked into my first "on ramp" program I was surprised to the range of people at the club - there were people who haven't worked out a day in their life to competitive athletes. I thought I was going to be intimidated at such an intense club, but I have never felt more welcomed in my life. If you're used to going to a gym - you owe it to yourself to join crossfit. It's such a healthy, open, accepting environment. NO JUDGEMENT here - whether you finish first or last, you're cheered on the entire way. You want everyone to do well and you're proud of yourself for beating your time from yesterday. I can't wait to continue crossfitting :)
