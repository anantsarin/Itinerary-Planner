There's always a great way to end a long weekend of adventure and hiking. If you are looking for a place to hang out, have some amazing coffee like the Oreo Cappuccino (it is to die for) which I have all the time we end our adventure at Minnewaska State Park Reserve. If you do have the opportunity to come over to New Paltz Cafeteria is the place to go, specially on Sundays that they have live jazz.
Really dirty coffee shop. Flies all over the place. Nice location but that's about it!
Large cafe with a cozy vibe. Free wifi. Came here on a Sunday afternoon and there was a live jazz band. Seems like this place is all drinks and limited eats. Only visible food offering was muffins. My cafe au lait wasn't the greatest, but sitting up in the cozy loft area, chatting it up with good company, made me wish there were coffee shops like this in my area.
There is one young woman here that single-handedly drives 80 percent of people away. It's really a feat.  She cannot hide her utter disgust for anything male. The irony is she wears a flower in her hair, so the juxtaposition of seething hatred when she slaps down your change and walks away is nearly filmic - something out of a Jim Jarmusch film.  Un-well British business men would pay for this sort of abuse. The space is always cold and dirty, but with a couple of small tweaks would be great and would actually take back all the Starbucks business. It's a shame, the owner seems like a cool guy.  I hate to see a couple of bad eggs bring down a place.

No restrooms!!??  I would have loved to have been able to visit and try the coffee and write a review of the offerings here, but I never got past the sign on The front door saying "NO PUBLIC RESTROOMS"! How a place that serves coffee and other drinks does not offer patrons restroom facilities is beyond me.  I wanted nothing more than to relax with a nice beverage but needed to use the restroom first so I passed this place up.  I can only conclude it's run by amateurs.  I hope they go out of business.

Hipster coffee place with old furniture. It reminds me of Tryst in Adams Morgan in DC. It has a lot of space to just sit, do work, drink coffee, and listen to live music. They have cupcakes, milkshakes, the usual coffee drinks.

Such a chill place!!  On a day-long road trip and this was an evening stop for a coffee and a relaxing sit.  We chilled on the most comfy couch on the planet and relaxed to casual background guitar music.  Nobody bothers anybody here and it's got plenty of space to just space out.  Oh, and the oreo cappuccino...yah, I would do unspeakable things for another one of those!!  Super hipster so if you can't handle the vibe, probably not worth the stop.  A bit pricey, though pay for great ambiance, if you're into that sort of thing.

Horrible coffee, bad moldy smell, worst service ever. Enjoy! I was drawn in by the size and atmosphere of the cafe but immediately smelled the mildew of the chairs, etc. I noticed the only employee sitting idly behind the bar and she seemed generally disgruntled, ultimately annoyed to have to get up to help me. My coffee was beyond weak. I returned to the counter to ask for a fresh cup and let her know the obvious problem. She spilled out my cup in the sink and as she poured a new one, told me it would be $1 refill. (!?)  I protested but she was unrelenting. Then she refused to give a refund... "Final sale", "not authorized to give refunds"... Chaos ensued. She was insane. Beyond worst, most hostile person I have ever met in food service. Psycho Do yourself a favor and DO NOT GO HERE!!!

Good solid fare. Nice vibe. Fair prices. Went there with some friends and spent a long time there without being rushed. Like that.

I really like this spot. Although I only ordered an Americano (with steamed milk), I loved the vibe (which had an artsy - hipster- hippy- student- college, mid 90s feel to it). It reminded me of the coffee houses on the Upper West side in the mid 90s, with all those victorian sofas and the coffee selection. I can imagine spending the entire day here, studying, writing or reading a book.

Hey remember that time I needed a super cozy place to have a cup of coffee and study? Found it! The Cafeteria is pretty large, and it has a bunch of different furniture making up the weating, and even has a lift area. It's in the heart of town, right on Main Street, and employs some pretty wonderful people. They have a wide variety of teas (my favorite!) and they make the tea bags by hand, which I think is fantastic. They have some good lighting, and they're open fairly late, which is always appreciated. One of my favorite places to chill in New Paltz! ;)

Cafeteria is a great space, with lots of comfy seating and a nice atmosphere. This is a great spot to have meetups, or hang out with a group. As far as the coffee goes, though? It's terrible. I've given it a chance on several occasions, and every single time, it's been weak, flavorless, and I have to wonder if there's even caffeine in it. I would be giving it 2 stars if it weren't for the spacious comfortable atmosphere.

So I haven't stepped foot into this place since the staff was extremely rude and the food trays were on the floor. I have been told they only want the hipsters business. Thats fine, I have no problem getting coffee at the bistro. They are still the best cafe in town.

Formerly known as the muddy cup. A cute and hipster-esque hangout with live music, open mic nights and good hot chocolate. Perfect for a hangout or a date.

Too cavernous to be cozy, but the college kids sure seem to like it. The coffee wasn't over-the-top good, which is sad, considering that it's, you know, a coffee shop.

Decent. comfy. Good coffee. Sometimes decent art and entertainment. Staff is friendly. Needs a good dusting.

The customer service at Cafeteria is usually pretty brusque, but the espresso drinks are pretty good.  I like the variety of iced teas.  Sometimes, a dirty vintage store smell hits you as you walk in.  While the vintage furniture is a nice touch, it  would probably benefit from a good cleaning.

The space is incredibly large, and somewhat cavernous. Be that as it may, this space has the potential to be the primary place for music in New Paltz. I myself have played in there from time to time, at the Sunday afternoon open mic jazz jam. My understanding was that the owner, who may or may not live upstairs, doesn't want any sort of louder music. This was told to me by an employee. I guess this means no bands with drummers. At these jazz jams, I've noticed a total lack of energy in the space, and the woman who works there is incredibly unfriendly. I have never seen her smile. Most people just come in to hang out on the couches, with their drinks, computers, and books. Pretty laid back, which is nice, but there is a time for being mellow, and a time for energy too. When I've played there, it seems like a lot of people aren't even listening.  There is also an enclosed musical instrument store in the space. The instruments seem to be of decent quality, although it's not like Alto, or Sam Ash, where you can grab an instrument, and start playing it (respectfully, of course). Coffee was okay; not great or terrible. Once again, looking at the space, I can't help feeling that there is great potential here, to be the only real music concert space in New Paltz village, but it does not feel like it is going in that direction at this time. It's a colossal waste of a space.
