A staple for Vassar faculty and students. Locals who love good food and a nice atmosphere also flock to Babycakes Cafe. The quality of the food has gone down over the years but the service has continued to get better. An excellent place to go for lunch.
The only disappointing thing about this place is they do not have baby cakes and their tiramisu cake isn't good.   Baby cakes which is located on college view drive,is a small package of fun.Its got coffee,cakes,pasta,burgers,sitouts,a live band performing once in a while.what more do you need?   I've been here twice and the last time i ordered the Vegan burger,which was ok and their salad turned out to contain too much vinegar.But it's definitely a good place to grab a cup of cafe and listen to some music or to just sit outside and watch the cars drive by.  I shall keep going back till they make baby cakes:) -Smriti
Babycakes Cafe is a very cozy college cafe located nearby the famous Rossi's Deli. With the flashy interior of Chinese lanterns and hipster employees, this place really is like something out of Brooklyn. I came in here to sit down and finish up some paperwork and it really is a nice place to do so. There are pastries, hot beverages, and even brunch menus here so you can basically stay here all day long. I had their Mulled Apple Cider and it was pretty hearty. It had a different feel from apple cider that I used to have which made me get it twice, not just one time. I also had a bite of the biscotti and gingersnap and they were okay as well. Great place to stop by and just sit down.
I can't agree more with Shin.  The food is absolutely awesome but it has two major flaws as I've experienced them several times now. 1) Service is stuck up. It runs all the way from the owners to the waitstaff.  There seems to be an attitude that they think they are the best and you (the customer) should be honored to be there.  Its a bit weird.  I work in NYC and have never even received such an attitude down there. 2) Their food is overpriced. Not expensive, but overpriced. I understand that they are going for the whole hip atmosphere for Vassar folks to go, but again, the prices are more than I find in Manhattan.
The food was very good, the service was great and the atmosphere was pleasant. BUT, I had to give them a lower score because they have the word "cafe" in their name and the macchiato that I just had there with breakfast was really really really really bad. Not okay, not blah, not subpar, just BAD. The thing about a macchiato is that since it is just espresso and a dollop of foam, there is no hiding the sins of crappy coffee under tons of milk and sugar. It was so burnt and icky. Even though I'm really into coffee, I will often give an otherwise good restaurant a pass on bad coffee if coffee isn't really a selling point of the place, but since this place is specifically called the Babycakes CAFE, they can't get away that in my book.
3.5 stars. Food is decent.  Really good coffee/lattes.  The staff is a bit clueless though.
They have real French fires here! Hand cut fries! ...Who does that anymore? Love the vegan burger too. They recently changed it to open face. I order it closed... I'm funny like that about my burgers. Beautiful natural wood atmosphere. The staff is very helpful. They want you to be happy with the food here. The place is clean and has lots of yummy homemade deserts too. Great place for lunch or dinner.
I'm in two minds about Babycakes.  I love the atmosphere; it's such a cute place to grab a meal with a friend, especially when the weather is nice enough to sit outside.  The food is yummy.  I've only been there for lunch, but I've never had a problem with a dish. That being said, what is the deal with the prices at this place?  You order at a counter, seat yourself, and bus your own plates when you're finished.  If you want water, you help yourself to the jug in the back.  It's basically a glorified Panera Bread, but the prices are more than you'd find at a full-service lunch spot in the same area!  $11.50 for a  simple sandwich?  You have some nerve, Babycakes!
I feel like a badass eating here... specifically, like I'm one of those celebrity hipsters eating at one of those posh, understated bistros in a major metro area. Except this awesome place is in Poughkeepsie, a hop, skip and a jump away from Vassar College and down the block from where Juliet's used to be. This place is absolutely fantastic - their breakfast and lunch offerings are out of this world. Their drinks? So awesome that they have so much to offer... and their baked goods? Worth it to bust your diet to try. This place has Beacon flair and Manhattan food style. Going to Baby Cakes? Take me with you!!!
If this rating were for food quality alone,  this would be 5 stars, no doubt. BUT This place is over priced. When I was a freshman at Vassar, this was a cute little place to splurge on brunch. by the time i graduated, they had doubled in size and added beer and wine to the menu. they accept the V-Card, which is great, I guess, but breakfast and coffee can easily run you up a $15 bill. With big tomato a 2 minute drive down the road, it's hard to justify spending so much money on some eggs and toast. If you're looking for a nice place to take your parents/grandparents for a sunday brunch, this is the place (but get there early and be ready to wait for a seat). if you're looking for a tasty, cozy little breakfast place, you might want to move on.
Babycakes is a decent choice if you're near Vassar Good breakfast options to stay or go ( are they still planning to cater at Poughkeepsie train station?) Brunch can be crazy, I've waited for ages to be seated and left for other options several times Dinner is sometimes wonderful, sometimes not so, but the live Jazz the other night was great. They also showcase local art for sale on the walls which is great! I did host a big graduation lunch there a while back and they did a stellar job So if your close try and enjoy its a great place to have in the community
I would drive the necessary 5 hours across New York State for the food at Baby Cakes. I have had lunch and breakfast there. I've heard the dinner menu is questionable. I can't speak to that, but breakfast and lunch were out of this world. As of July 12th, 2010, Baby Cakes holds the record for not only my number 1 cheeseburger of all time, but also my number 1 waffle (Belgian) of all time. It was one of those rare moments where I took a bite, put down the food, and just stared at it--that's how damn good it was. I don't even remember how much the food cost. Those meals are quite rare for me, and two of them happened at Baby Cakes! The pastries and desserts they sell are also phenomenal. It would be a shame to pass through Poughkeepsie without stopping at Baby Cakes.
I've only had breakfast here, but have a few times.  It's never great, but it is consistently good!  The menu is simple but unique enough to keep us coming back.  I like a place that I can have a tap beer with my late breakfast.
I love the atmosphere of this place. It's hard to explain. It's kind of downtown loft meets yuppy college meets hippy meets barista. It fits my crazy personality quite well, because no matter what mood I am in, I am comfortable there. I have to be careful with what I eat and ingredients and how foods are prepared. They have a very nutritious quinoa salad there that fits with what I am allowed to and should eat. The service is better than expected with such a young and hip staff, and they answer questions well with my dietary concerns in mind. We tried them before I had to start eating healthy, and loved it then too, because I was able to try their baby cakes. OMGosh! They are fantastic! It's probably a good thing that I am not allowed to eat cake anymore, because I could just mow down on their entire display. My husband got the turkey swiss and could not stop making yummy noises about it. He is a chef and pretty picky in restaurants like that; so I was impressed by how excited he was about his sandwich. We have only been there for lunch, so I can't tell you about dinner or their bar scene. I would like to try the brunch some day, because they have a brioche french toast stuffed with banana cream cheese that sounds amazing. (Alas, I cannot try it while on this eating plan, but a girl can dream!)
I recently had the pleasure of dining at Babycakes with several yelpers, some who I knew and some I had the pleasure of meeting for the first time. I figured that Babycakes would be a good venue for such a gathering as they have enough variety, a good price point and the ability to accommodate a small sized group. It is a nice location and right at Vassar so the vibe is more hip than hip replacement (as I learned the difference recently at another restie but I digress...). The service was spotty though it was not particularly crowded and unfortunately one of our party had to send a dish back as it was too salty. My Vegetarian Muffaletta was just aight. Not great not terrible. Just A-OK in a good way. Unfortunately the bread pudding we brought home to share later was a bit dry and disappointing. I really want to love Babycakes but after several visits over the past many months it never seems to live up to the expectations I have for it. I would not not go back but I would not make it a destination either. Solid 3.03 stars. But 5 stars to my fellow yelpers who helped make any culinary shortcomings well worth it. It was a fun time and I hope to have the chance to yelp in person with you all again soon! youtube.com/watch?v=6vC3…
(Preface:  This place is on my "Two-Week List," in which I list the top twenty restaurants and bars that I'd go to if some soothsayer came up to me and told me that I only had two weeks to live.  Check out the full list on my profile!) I cannot tell you the number of hours I spent here as an undergrad -- possibly more hours than I spent in the library.  They have something in their breakfast food that is actually addictive.  I don't know what it is.  But it should be outlawed.  My freshman fifteen were definitely due to Babycakes. The space used to be ridiculously small, with only a few tables, and when they expanded and added a bar, it was seriously better news to me than hearing that I'd passed my logic exam.  I AM NOT JOKING.   I have had everything on the menu, probably numerous times.  Breakfast is really fantastic here, but their sandwiches and soups are also superb.  And dinner -- their pumpkin ravioli (if they still have it!) is really out of this universe.  And get a pastry.  All of them. When we were seniors, my housemate and I would frequent the bar for a good glass of Nero d'Avola.  Gary the bartender was the best.  A lot of time there'd be live, folk-y music, too, or trivia-- an added touch.  My only complaint is that it closed at 11:00 PM on the weekends.   This is the perfect place to bring your parents when they visit (my mom still misses it... as do I!), an ideal place to grab coffee with your adviser, and great place to get to know a classmate better.  If you don't live in Poughkeepsie, it's a good reason to visit!!
Recently paid Babycakes a visit with some other fabulous Yelpers for dinner.  When I joined my group, I noticed everyone was drinking water and there was a glass of water waiting for me.  When the waiter came by, they didn't ask if we wanted anything to drink.  I know I could have easily asked for something but  isn't that part of your job as a waiter to ask? Whatever, I'll stick to water. I ordered the Chipolte Chicken Sandwich with melted cheddar, lettuce, tomato, chipotle mayo on ciabatta. I got this with a salad.  Thankfully the dressing on the salad was delicious. I would tell you what dressing it was but the waiter did not ask if a) I wanted dressing and b) what my dressing options were - just take the dressing we give you and like it!!!   Did I like it? Yes I did, very much.  I got a carrot muffin for dessert to go which had good icing but the cake was a bit on the dry side.   I thought the setting and the way Babycakes was decorated was pretty cool and the  service was nice and friendly but not asking about drinks and dressing sat a bit weird for me.  Afterall this is a college spot, you may get some kids coming in who may not care for those things but you should still follow the standard restaurant procedure. It goes a long way.
Three of us met for breakfast here and for the most part, all enjoyed our food. The place doesn't have typical table service for breakfast/lunch and is run like a Panera, but with much higher prices. I always have mixed feelings about the place when I come here though. The service is chilly, prices are on the high side and the place is generally mobbed. This visit my frittata, though good, came out lukewarm and my toast was soggy. And my café latte was one of the worst I've ever tasted, though my husband said his café mocha was delicious. We've had better experiences eating dinner here.
Ironically, I like everything about Babycakes except their signature dessert... I've had dinner at Babycakes several times and always enjoyed it.  Their beer list has enough variety to be decent without being extensive. Take advantage of the appetizer specials when they're available. My favorite is the Greek sliders. Nice variety on the entrees and specials. I like the menu desserts too, but I've never had luck with the babycakes themselves. They've always been too dry for my taste. I think it's because they're kept in the cooler, and you never know exactly how long they've been in there. Today I tried breakfast for the first time. That had caught my attention the past few dinner visits because of the huge write-up of the breakfast menu on the blackboard on the right as you walk in. I'd give breakfast 3 stars. You order breakfast at the counter, and they deliver it to you.  The whole-grain pancakes I ordered were good and accompanied by fresh blueberries and strawberries, but $9 for 2 pancakes seemed a bit steep.  Someone else ordered the banana brioche french toast, which was more flavorful and seemed a better deal.
I recently went back to Vassar for my college reunion and was very relieved to find the Babycakes Cafe as a good alternative to college campus food.  A few friends and I stumbled upon it while in desperate search for a drink after seeing a few too many college buddies now in possession of baby strollers. I can definitely recommend their martinis - especially the white grape and pomegranate ones, very yummy and the prices is definitely right (of course I may be a little skewed because my comparator is martini prices in New York and San Francisco). The wine by the glass was so-so. Although the pour was generous (maybe a function of 3 ladies making friends with the bartender), I didn't find the quality to be too outstanding. But the experience stood out so much that we returned the next day for brunch in order to avoid reliving the ACDC experience. I had the stuffed french toast, which was quite yummy and generous, as was my friend's frittata. The coffee is bottomless and unlike most other bottomless cup experiences actually isn't watered down and has some caffeine. The only downside here is that they don't have fresh OJ, as a matter of fact, you have to buy an individual bottle of Simply Orange, which I thought was a bit of a cop out. But overall, I thought it was a good experience. I appreciated their veggie and vegan selections. I definitely wish it was there when I was at Vassar!
Let me preface this review by saying I've only been for brunch. So maybe dinner is the absolute cats pajamas, and I would be none the wiser.  But this review isn't about dinner. Its about brunch. Brunch. Brunch. Brunch! I freaking love brunch.  I'm constantly on the prowl for good spots to have a leisurely brunch with a gaggle of friends.  You know the kind of brunch that starts off innocent enough over coffee and eggs dissecting the drama of the week before... but slowly morphs into a "sunday session" and you suddenly find yourself accidentally tipsy at 3 pm off bloody marys? Yeah...Babycakes is not that place. I keep going wanting to love it.  And truly, there is nothing wrong with it at all. The food is pretty good. The coffee is good.  The service is... ehhhh... its ok.  The layout is a little awkward, when it gets crowded people swarming the counter and spilling over to the dining floor with tables just behind.  Needs some feng shui or something. Basically, its just not the place I want it to be. I can't quite place where it goes off the tracks.... but it does. Just a smidge. Its good but not great. I'll keep going there for lack of better options and for the reasons mentioned above (pretty good food & coffee) and the fact that they have some outdoor seating in the summer (although not nearly enough... but really, there aren't too many al fresco dining options in the city of Poughkeepsie, now are there?)
It's a cute place. I was a little confused when I first walked in because, having never been there before, I didn't know how the ordering system worked. Let me fill you in so you don't run into the same blunders I did. You may at first find yourself wanting to sit down at a table right away. Don't be deceived by the servers and bussers luring you tableward. First, place your order at the front counter. Approach with caution because if you stand too close too soon, you'll be asked for your order, which you may not have decided yet. Make your selection from the large chalkboard behind the counter, but be aware that the omelet filling selections are listed on the counter itself, taped near the register.   After placing your order, the cashier will present you with a number attached to a stand. You are now free to meander through the room looking for the perfect table, upon which you will place your numbered stand and hence your meal will find it's way to you. I hope you find the instruction helpful. Aside from the feeling of disorientation upon entry and the price of the food ($13 for and omelet and coffee) everything was fine. If I didn't care about the fact that I walked ten blocks for an over priced omelet that i could have made at home, i would go back in a heartbeat. So, if you are in the mood for a cute cafe and very hungry (the portions are huge btw) and  are not skilled in the culinary artistry that is omelet making, stop by Babycakes.
On paper it all sounds great. But the execution leaves a lot to be desired--especially at these prices. The atmosphere is cute and eclectic. During the day, it feels laid-back. I liked that there's a variety of seating in different sections: at the bar, tables, high-tops. An egg and cheese on croissant was oversized and underseasoned. The teriyaki chicken sandwich was also large, also underseasoned, and accompanied by a side salad soaked in dressing. The white bean soup had all the oomph of dishwater. On the positive side, the frittata was layered with veggies and topped with pesto. The fruit crepes--actually filled with sweet cheese--were lovely. My vanilla chai latte was perfect, and I hear that the hot chocolate is brilliant. I found the wait staff variable: Those at the register seemed to be killing time, while the runners/bussers were warm and friendly. I recommend sticking with the sweet stuff and beverages, and getting Mom and Dad to pay.
Visited them again for lunch after few months break. Everybody's food were great (CURRIED TOFU WRAP, QUINOA SALAD). Deserts are just a little bit  pricey but they are very good quality as well.
Every time I walk into this place, I linger in front of the display case full of desserts. I usually pick out a multi-fruit tart or the apple tart. But the food can be a hit or miss. I recently had the tex-mex wrap with scrambled eggs, peppers, salsa, onions and cheese. I ate all my orange slices and ate less than half of the wrap. I don't know. The wrap was lackluster. Another time, I ordered the avocado sandwich, which was just "eh." The service is stuck-up. One time, we were standing at the counter, waiting for someone to take our order. One female employee told a male employee at the cash register to do a task. He gave her a look and said he was leaving in five minutes. Here we were, standing in front of him and we're still waiting to be noticed. I can't remember who finally took our order, but my companion was pissed about the service. I keep thinking the food's going to be awesome here, that I'm going to have a great meal, but lately it hasn't happened. I do love the desserts, and that's why I keep coming back.
Babycakes is actually three totally different places in one, and each gets 5 big stars from me. 1. Cafe: In the day, the cafe doesn't offer table service, but you order at the front, and the food is brought out to your table. They have a stand-out breakfast/brunch menu with tons of delicious and healthy vegetarian options. There are plenty of great sandwich and soup options too, but you'll probably find yourself distracted by the huge display case of delectable desserts and pastries, which are baked fresh daily. In the warmer months, there are a smattering of tables and chairs outside where you can enjoy a cup of their amazing espresso. And who doesn't love outdoor seating? 2. Restaurant: In the evening, the cafe shifts into a table-service restaurant with a friendly and competent wait staff. The food is inventive and tasty, especially with the addition of their new head chef. Even in our post-modern, carb-conscious, diet-crazed frenzy, everyone raves about the fried mac-n-cheese fritters. You should try them too... 3. Gay bar: Wait! What?! Yes, that's right. On Wednesday nights, B-Cakes turns into a local watering hole for the pink crowd. They dim the lights, and tipsy gays belly up to the fully stocked bar until well past midnight. There's a good mix of ages and genders, and the clientele is friendly and open. The jovial, older bartender, his twinky (straight?) bar hand, and the super-hot general manager make it *the* place to be on Wednesday nights. Three-for-one, Babycakes is the jewel in this little Arlington neighborhood of shops and restaurants.
The only disappointing thing about this place is they do not have baby cakes and their tiramisu cake isn't good.   Baby cakes which is located on college view drive,is a small package of fun.Its got coffee,cakes,pasta,burgers,sitouts,a live band performing once in a while.what more do you need?   I've been here twice and the last time i ordered the Vegan burger,which was ok and their salad turned out to contain too much vinegar.But it's definitely a good place to grab a cup of cafe and listen to some music or to just sit outside and watch the cars drive by.  I shall keep going back till they make baby cakes:) -Smriti

5 stars for the food and drinks, but thumbs down for the crappy service.  You know that feeling you get when you walk into somewhere and the people behind the counter are staring you down?  Well, that's exactly how I feel everytime I walk into Babycakes.   The last time I went there the young lady behind the counter couldn't get my order correct and sent out the wrong soup.  She did not apologize, but instead someone else apologized.  She walked passed my table sevearl times and stared our table down several times as well.  Talk about enjoying great food with crappy service...Babycakes is the place.  I should have never tipped her...
I had a great breakfast here.  Went with the oatmeal and a cappy.  The oatmeal was not in liquid form but more baked and sprinkled with berries and yogurt if you so choose.  Was not sweet which I liked.  My dining companion enjoyed one of the egg dishes.  The decor was cute, and we chose to sit outside at the several tables they have available.   I would definitely return.
We live literally 5 minutes away from this place and only went there recently to try the place out. I went with my cousin who is a vegetarian and her fiance, who is very particular and my wife and I for brunch on a Sunday morning. We walked in and found the place full of people and full of life. We ordered at the counter and sat down at this gorgeous hardwood table to eat. The food was great, I had a cheeseburger (I know, not your standard brunch fare but I saw someone else eating one and had to order one) and my cousin and my wife had the frittata and her fiance had the waffles. Everything was delicious! We returned the following week for dinner on a Friday night and was surprised to see the entire personality of the place completely changed. They had typical waiter service and the staff was very friendly and courteous. They also had live music, which is always a plus. We tried the edamame falafel which was very tasty and the crispy goat cheese rounds for the appetizers. They were both tasty and delicious. For dinner we ate the vegetarian lasagna and the grilled salmon. Of course we had to try dessert, we ate like there was no tomorrow, I had the s'mores cake and my wife enjoyed the chocolate cake of some kind. All and all we had a great time both times going there and can't wait to go again. I'm torn between giving it 4 or 5 stars but I'll have to go with the 5.
I think Babycakes food is pretty darn tasty. I love the crepes to death. The no-flour chocolate cake is to die for. Recently I had a gift card and treated myself to the filet mignon, and it was easily the best steak I've ever had. I've never had a problem with the service, and the decor is adorable. That said, the prices are a bit outrageous. Drinks range from $2.50 to $5.00, and refills are not offered. Entrees are on the pricey side, too, especially if you're just having lunch. The best experiences I've had are when I've just gone for dessert. This is not a place to come with a large group; they only have one large table, and can't really put other smaller ones together. Go to Zorona's if you have more than five people in your party and Babycakes is hopping. My New Yorker boyfriend claims Babycakes is akin to the cafes you find in Manhattan - great food and drinks, but the prices will floor you, which is great in Manhattan, but kind of strange for Poughkeepsie. On the bright side, they do accept the Vassar Vcard. Also just to clarify, For breakfast and lunch you should order at the counter, but for dinner they have full waiter service.
Babycakes is best for breakfast and lunch--at dinner the vibe becomes confused and bar-ish, and the prices go up a lot.  That aside, this place has yummy food.  The ingredients are high quality, fresh, and loved, and it's a good value.  The desserts in the cooler are great, the coffee is a treat, and the Stuffed French Toast is almost perfect in every way.  But make sure to avoid rush hours like late morning on a weekend.  Get here early for breakfast or go during the week.  Late lunch isn't too insane except on unlucky weekends.  I wish they had a better system for dealing with the lines that build up, but people just sort-of horde in. I hope you don't have an unlucky experience, because when you're at Babycakes on a good day at the right time, it's a 5-star place.
Just ate here and let me start off with the fact that I called ahead of time to know wheater or not they are dog friendly. They said yes so I preceded to give it a try since it has a four star rating. Once I got here they were not liking the fact that we had dogs with us. It was a whole diff story and I was told the chef is really iffy about having dogs so they had to be outside the gate not in. We felt uncomfortable the whole time because we felt like they were not being attentive enough and were too focused on our dogs not disturbing other people. Now lets talk about food, the food was good, not good enough for the price though. . No I would not come back and no its not worth the money. I don't care if your a no pets kinda place just say so and don't say you are pet friendly if your really not.
The have changed hands and I can NOT recommend the new hot dogs. I ordered 2 chicken dogs, which was my usual order, but I could only choke down one of them. The skin was tough and I could taste filler--I know it wasn't actually sawdust, but it sure tasted like it. Sad to see this lunchtime treat go down the tubes like this.
This review is for bakery selections only. Also, this review is from memories ranging from 5+ years ago. But that is all to say...their opera cake introduced me to a world of hazelnuttiness, spongeform goodness, and chocolate ganache-panache that I have never forgotten. The rest of my life will be spent hunting down opera cakes. Thus far, I have had no luck finding an even remotely satisfactory replacement. I have gone to local bakeries, with either no results or poor imitations. I even looked in the theatre building downtown, to no avail. Frankly, I hope for the sake of the waistlines of the college kids there now that they no longer carry this saintly savory succulence. If they do, indulge if you dare. You had better be willing to crave it for the rest of your life, just like me.
Eh, not too shabby.  It is what you would expect from a hippie kind of college place.  They have a lot of weird, natural type plates.  I had an open-faced sandwich with brie.  Too much brie but had some nice flavors.  A little pricey for lunch plates but again, it has more natural type foods than your typical greasy plates. I was up in the area for an interview but I could see myself being here many times in a semester if I went to Vassar. Try them out.
When I started at Vassar Babycakes was a small cafe-type place tucked away on Collegeview, with a few seats, a breakfast & lunch menu, and lots of great pastries.  Before I graduated, Babycakes expanded both its size and its menus, adding on a full dining room, dinner menu, and alcohol.  I frequented Babycakes more often after its expansion, and have a lot of mixed feelings. On the one hand, daytime dining is great, if a bit confusing and crowded on parent-friendly Vassar weekends.  You order and pay at the counter, take a number, then find yourself a seat.  10 to 20 minutes later, your food arrives.  When you're done, there's no waiting for a check, you can just up and leave.  Not to mention, the food options during this time are great.  I love the choose-three-fillings omelet (available from 8a to 3p like the rest of the breakfast items) as well as the honey ham brie melt and the croque monsieur (which can be ordered from 10a to 5p). I prefer breakfasting and lunching to the restaurant experience at night.  While the dinner menu looks awesome, I never found any of the food to be that spectacular.  A friend and I had a joint birthday dinner here, and I can't remember what I got for my main course!  It just wasn't that great.  I do remember that the panko-crusted chicken tenders were good, but it is kind of hard to mess up chicken tenders, no? Then there are the desserts, which are tiny and adorable and rather expensive.  I love love love the lemon drop, and the similar raspberry-flavored one.  They're both little bits of cheesecake covered in delicious fruit flavor.  But they're tiny and $2.50. I don't like the signature baby cakes.  I find them to be too frosted and... well, gross.  All of the frosting and fruit and cake layers were not really stuck together very well, and the baby cake would just fall apart when I tried to eat it.  And that was really unappealing. Finally, the drink selection... that is pretty much 100% awesome.  I love that they have Joe Tea and a variety of glass-bottled sodas.  And Serendipitea!  SO MUCH SERENDIPITEA.  One of my favorite teas is their Once Upon a Tea, a vanilla/chocolate/mint rooibos that rocks my world.  Not only could I get a cuppa at Babycakes, but they'd sell me loose tea in a teabag to take home and brew in my dorm room later, saving me a trip on a cold winter day.
I really like Babycakes, but feel oddly uncomfortable here. It's the same sensation I get if trapped in the women's section of a department store, or accidentally wander into a restricted access area of a building; that "wooah I gotta get out of here" emotion sweeps over me. Is Babycakes just for women? It's probably just me. My mental challenges aside, Babycakes does have some wonderfully decadent desserts, e.g. the Chocolate Bomb. The rest of the menu is mostly soups, sandwiches and wraps; all very good. As other reviews have described, service is Panera Bread style, and can be a bit languid. Still, 4 Stars solid, very good food.
It was a bit busy, and the service a bit slow, but the sangria's fantastic don't cha know! The goat cheese appetizer whet my taste, and the salad was huge- surprisingly great! It's close to Vassar, so the location rocks. And the name drew me in- Babycakes is tops!
I've enjoyed coming to Babycakes for breakfast, lunch, coffee, and occasional pastry fixes many times over the past few years. The restaurant itself has a young-ish feel to it, mostly because it is a favorite of Vassar College students. During the day, food you order your food at the register and take a number for your table. If the restaurant is too busy (which is frequently the case on weekends from 11am to 1pm), this system can be chaotic: the line of people waiting to order really clogs up the front half of the restaurant. That being said, the food is totally worth the wait. To drink, Babycakes offers a number of coffee, tea, and espresso drinks--if you like mochas, theirs is very tasty (I particularly love the fact that they sprinkle some cinnamon on top). The coffee is solidly good, and always comes hot. There are also juices, sodas, and a well-stocked bar (they often have happy hour events with live music). I've only had dinner at Babycakes once to date, and the meal wasn't particularly memorable. That being said, that experience was soon after the restaurant was remodeled, so things may have changed. The prices go up at dinner and the service shifts from ordering your meal up front to a full-service waitstaff. On the other hand, I've enjoyed many breakfasts and lunches at Babycakes. For breakfast, try the Brioche French Toast stuffed with sweetened cream cheese and topped with caramelized bananas: the dish is just as decadent as it sounds, and absolutely delicious. If you're in the mood for something a bit lighter, the crepes with fresh fruit are also a good choice. In addition to these two dishes, Babycakes also serves excellent waffles, several egg dishes, and a house-made granola. I'm slightly more partial to their breakfast menu, however, they have some nice options for lunch too. Their chipotle chicken sandwich has a nice kick to it and is served on nice, fresh bread. I also really like their mozzarella and pesto melt: it's simple, but tasty. Last, the soups are often quite tasty: they change daily. In addition to being a restaurant, Babycakes is also a bakery. I'm not a big fan of their signature "Babycakes": I've tried the lemon cake, and found the frosting to taste too much like butter. I do, however, love their Chocolate Decadence, a flourless chocolate cake. Though the Chocolate Bomb (chocolate mousse) and S'More are certainly tasty, the Chocolate Decadence is the must-have dessert for chocoholics. Other standout pastries include the Opera Torte and the fruit tart, topped with fruit that varies by season. In the mood for something simple? The chocolate chocolate-chip cookies (or any other cookie for that manner) are also pretty fabulous.
Definitely a trendy place for college students who want to impress just enough to make the mark, but not so much to splurge on an iffy date. The sandwich menu is similar to Panera Bread, but on a fancier tier.  It's the deserts that will impress.  I had the individual sized Chocolate Bombe, Death-by-Chocolate cake, and other yummy delectables.  The deserts look better than they taste, but they still taste "A-OK."  It's pricey, but not outrageous.
The only reason why I am giving Babycakes three stars is because of their entrees and desserts, which are interesting, tasty, delicious, but a little on the expensive side. OMG, their carrot cupcake is THE best - the cream cheese frosting on it meshes well with the carroty-walnut-y cake...so good! Probably the best carrot cake that I have had, and trust me on this, I've had my fair share of carrot cakes in and around NYC... Okay, so you're probably wondering why I'm giving Babycakes three stars...Their coffee is despicable! It is unsatisfying and distasteful, or to be more accurate, tasteLESS. Every time I stop by for a cup of coffee, I always have so much hope for a decent cup of coffee, but each time, I am so thoroughly disappointed with how my coffee just tastes like hot milk... :(... you would think that a cafe located right next to a college would have coffee that actually has enough caffeine in it to wake a student up to do homework... BUT NO... SO, if you're someone who enjoys having a GOOD cup of coffee, don't come here.. you will be disappointed (turn the corner and go to crafted kup instead...)
Good breakfast here.  Clean healthy living without too much fuss.  Good options for everyone in our party and polite and prompt waitstaff.  I would return anytime.
Love this dig - delightful little desserts, interesting coffee choices, and sometimes have surprisingly good beer specials and local brews. I've always had a pleasant experience here, and it appeals to the young, the old, and the college student all at the same time. Still haven't been to brunch, but perhaps the next time I'm venturing to Poughkeepsie I'll have to swing by.
I really want to love this place! Being new to the area and living a short walk away, I've been here several times now because it's got everything I want in a cafe: lots of vegetarian options, locally sourced ingredients, a vast drink menu, and cozy atmosphere. While a couple of dishes and experiences have been superb, overall meals and service has been mixed. The first time I went for Sunday morning brunch, and my omelette was decent, but the atmosphere - not the food -- brought me back for more. We've had dinner twice now, and the dinner service has been great, though slow (it was packed both times), and the food really good, but pricey. Again, the atmosphere is what keeps us going back because the vegetarian options are good... but not necessarily worth the price. This was confirmed for me when I went here for lunch takeout the other day. I was really psyched to try the Avocado Cheddar sandwich, which sounded delicious. But for $9.50, I was expecting a hearty portion. Instead, it was small sandwich bread, 4 chunks of avocado, and a very thin single slice of yellow cheddar that I almost couldn't taste. I've made better, more filling sandwiches at home with the same ingredients. Babycakes is great for a light dinner, drinks, or dessert, but for breakfast, lunch, or takeout, so far the results have been just OK.
Always happy to drop in here for a nice, healthy lunch. Mellow atmosphere with great coffee, nice twists on classic sandwiches & delicious soups. Wish I lived closer...
Nice place, but vegans need to be very particular in what they order. I think their main problem is that they have no idea how to prepare tofu. Definitely do not order anything with tofu and that alone will make your experience much better. This was my third visit, so I am sure of this. On my previous visits, I had the veggie burger which kind of fell apart and did not leave me feeling that I wanted to order it again. I also previously ordered the breakfast burrito with large squares of uncooked tofu. No sure why they didn't just sautee the tofu with all the other veggies. On this visit, we ordered two wraps for lunch - one a tofu curry wrap with fries and the other was eggplant with sauteed onions and portabella mushrooms and salad with balsamic dressing. Forget the tofu curry wrap - basically filled with large squares of raw tofu. I think if they just mashed up the tofu and mixed it in, it would have been so much more enjoyable. The fries were great, though, and we gobbled them right up. The eggplant wrap was good - it reminded me of a Philly cheesesteak (no soy cheese available in this restaurant, though). And the salad was good.  We both liked the balsamic dressing. We tried the white bean and kale soup which had this sour taste that ruined it, totally. The staff here is very nice and accommodating. This restaurant has so much potential, but for now, I think I will wait to return until they perfect their vegan dishes.
came here for a job interview.  we sat at the table near the bathroom but we might as well have been sitting in the bathroom cuz I could smell it.  For brunch I ordered some crepes which were okay but had more of a gelatinous quality than i would have liked.  It was obviously high in sugar and didn't really have fresh ingredients.  My girlfriend really had an awful experience.  They made her an iced tea which looked curdled and her chicken sandwich was "one of the worse meals" she's ever had in her life.  FAIL.
Lovely atmosphere & staff. Delicious desserts & good coffee.
Everything I've ever had here has been delicious - eggs, sandwiches, salads, desserts, all fantastic. My favorite lunch spot in Poughkeepsie and someplace where you can always try something new and always leave happy. If you don't have room for dessert, get something to go, you won't be disappointed.
Great food!
5 stars for the food and drinks, but thumbs down for the crappy service.  You know that feeling you get when you walk into somewhere and the people behind the counter are staring you down?  Well, that's exactly how I feel everytime I walk into Babycakes.   The last time I went there the young lady behind the counter couldn't get my order correct and sent out the wrong soup.  She did not apologize, but instead someone else apologized.  She walked passed my table sevearl times and stared our table down several times as well.  Talk about enjoying great food with crappy service...Babycakes is the place.  I should have never tipped her...
When you are sick of the campus coffee(which needless to say, is inevitable) stop by Bab Cakes Bakery for a break.  Their coffee, while not the finest coffee in the world, doesn't even compare to the burnt roast of the day at ACDC (all campus dining center).  There salads looks a lot better than they taste though, which is not to be said about their baked goods. The scones, croissants etc are delicious, this is def a great breakfast place. Try to go at odd hours though, while they expanded the seating, the line is five years long on a busy weekend morning. Oh and yes, they accept v-cash
I had a great breakfast here.  Went with the oatmeal and a cappy.  The oatmeal was not in liquid form but more baked and sprinkled with berries and yogurt if you so choose.  Was not sweet which I liked.  My dining companion enjoyed one of the egg dishes.  The decor was cute, and we chose to sit outside at the several tables they have available.   I would definitely return.
It's a bit of a mish-mash. They have excellent pastries which are beautiful and tasty. It's a great place to stop for a coffee and pastry and to pick up pretty desserts for the house. But they try to do everything here, and the result is downright confusing! Bakery, coffee shop, breakfast, lunch, dinner, bar, nightclub, etc. Where/how to go about ordering your lunch which is different from how it's done at dinner, where the line begins, etc...it's just a bit of a jumble. Maybe it's just too early for me when I go in but I always find it more confusing then to needs to be. Be careful when ordering breakfast items--the pricing is odd and you can end up paying a ton of money for your omelette fillings. The pastries are better than the food, I recommend Babycakes for sweets and coffee over grub.
We live literally 5 minutes away from this place and only went there recently to try the place out. I went with my cousin who is a vegetarian and her fiance, who is very particular and my wife and I for brunch on a Sunday morning. We walked in and found the place full of people and full of life. We ordered at the counter and sat down at this gorgeous hardwood table to eat. The food was great, I had a cheeseburger (I know, not your standard brunch fare but I saw someone else eating one and had to order one) and my cousin and my wife had the frittata and her fiance had the waffles. Everything was delicious! We returned the following week for dinner on a Friday night and was surprised to see the entire personality of the place completely changed. They had typical waiter service and the staff was very friendly and courteous. They also had live music, which is always a plus. We tried the edamame falafel which was very tasty and the crispy goat cheese rounds for the appetizers. They were both tasty and delicious. For dinner we ate the vegetarian lasagna and the grilled salmon. Of course we had to try dessert, we ate like there was no tomorrow, I had the s'mores cake and my wife enjoyed the chocolate cake of some kind. All and all we had a great time both times going there and can't wait to go again. I'm torn between giving it 4 or 5 stars but I'll have to go with the 5.
As a Marist student, I am more than willingly to take the drive over to Baby Cakes. What I love most is the comfortable, relaxed, atmosphere and of course the food and beverages they offer. You really can't go wrong with any coffee, meal or dessert. It's just a really cute place to go to if you want a light but filling lunch or to chat with a friend over coffee and a dessert. If they have the espresso cream puffs when you go, get them!
I think Babycakes food is pretty darn tasty. I love the crepes to death. The no-flour chocolate cake is to die for. Recently I had a gift card and treated myself to the filet mignon, and it was easily the best steak I've ever had. I've never had a problem with the service, and the decor is adorable. That said, the prices are a bit outrageous. Drinks range from $2.50 to $5.00, and refills are not offered. Entrees are on the pricey side, too, especially if you're just having lunch. The best experiences I've had are when I've just gone for dessert. This is not a place to come with a large group; they only have one large table, and can't really put other smaller ones together. Go to Zorona's if you have more than five people in your party and Babycakes is hopping. My New Yorker boyfriend claims Babycakes is akin to the cafes you find in Manhattan - great food and drinks, but the prices will floor you, which is great in Manhattan, but kind of strange for Poughkeepsie. On the bright side, they do accept the Vassar Vcard. Also just to clarify, For breakfast and lunch you should order at the counter, but for dinner they have full waiter service.
Went with a group and despite being busy they were very friendly and found us a spot to sit. Coffee was really good (I'm a bit of a snob on that front). I enjoyed a Tomato, Mozzarella, and Pesto sandwich. A little pricey like other folks noted but I'm from out of town and where I live, all we have is chains so I'm glad to pay a little more to support (and enjoy) an independent, local business.
Babycakes is best for breakfast and lunch--at dinner the vibe becomes confused and bar-ish, and the prices go up a lot.  That aside, this place has yummy food.  The ingredients are high quality, fresh, and loved, and it's a good value.  The desserts in the cooler are great, the coffee is a treat, and the Stuffed French Toast is almost perfect in every way.  But make sure to avoid rush hours like late morning on a weekend.  Get here early for breakfast or go during the week.  Late lunch isn't too insane except on unlucky weekends.  I wish they had a better system for dealing with the lines that build up, but people just sort-of horde in. I hope you don't have an unlucky experience, because when you're at Babycakes on a good day at the right time, it's a 5-star place.
An Arlington favorite serving casual bistro fare. The Vassar crowd lends a young vibrant flavor to the place.  The tight seating is usually full, and for good reason. Solid kitchen and young friendly staff. The place started as a bakery and the deserts showcase that legacy. definitely worth a stop if you are in the area.
Just ate here and let me start off with the fact that I called ahead of time to know wheater or not they are dog friendly. They said yes so I preceded to give it a try since it has a four star rating. Once I got here they were not liking the fact that we had dogs with us. It was a whole diff story and I was told the chef is really iffy about having dogs so they had to be outside the gate not in. We felt uncomfortable the whole time because we felt like they were not being attentive enough and were too focused on our dogs not disturbing other people. Now lets talk about food, the food was good, not good enough for the price though. . No I would not come back and no its not worth the money. I don't care if your a no pets kinda place just say so and don't say you are pet friendly if your really not.
"Woke up fell out of bed dragged a comb across my head found my way downstairs and drank a cup and looking up I noticed I was late..." -The Beatles If I went to bed at 2AM or later on the weekend, I would never be able to get my butt out of bed in time to get Belgian Waffles at Babycakes.  I would run out the door and by the time I would get to the counter, they'd tell me that they were out. Khhaaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnn!!!! However, if I stayed up the night before... We'd walk in, fairly sure we seemed alert and sober but we probably staggered in like winos fresh off a bender.  We'd grab the middle tables in this tiny nook and place our order, eagerly watching the clock until the waitstaff arrived with our meals. The food would arrive and we would dig in like a pack of starving hyenas, feasting before a pride of lions showed up to claim a prize. The chocolate croissants were a good subsitute if they didn't have the waffles.
The have changed hands and I can NOT recommend the new hot dogs. I ordered 2 chicken dogs, which was my usual order, but I could only choke down one of them. The skin was tough and I could taste filler--I know it wasn't actually sawdust, but it sure tasted like it. Sad to see this lunchtime treat go down the tubes like this.
Creative menu. Good coffee. Art and framed photography cluttering the walls (all for sale by local artists), ambient-lighting, and good service.
This review is for bakery selections only. Also, this review is from memories ranging from 5+ years ago. But that is all to say...their opera cake introduced me to a world of hazelnuttiness, spongeform goodness, and chocolate ganache-panache that I have never forgotten. The rest of my life will be spent hunting down opera cakes. Thus far, I have had no luck finding an even remotely satisfactory replacement. I have gone to local bakeries, with either no results or poor imitations. I even looked in the theatre building downtown, to no avail. Frankly, I hope for the sake of the waistlines of the college kids there now that they no longer carry this saintly savory succulence. If they do, indulge if you dare. You had better be willing to crave it for the rest of your life, just like me.
This is a great little place just off campus.  I like the Panera-style order-pay-food delivered, mostly because I hate to end a meal waiting for the check.  My breakfast (a waffle with fresh fruit, vanilla custard, and whipped cream) was delicious.  The waffle was nicely crisped up (noting worse than a limp waffle), and the vanilla custard was completely amazing.  The fresh fruit of the day was grapes (meh) and orange slices (on a waffle?), but it really only needed the vanilla custard to make my day!  The prices were Waffle House cheap, but this place is several steps above that in quality, and I felt like I got my money's worth.  We tried to go back for lunch, but it was packed with all of the alumni back for reunion, so we ended up going elsewhere, but next time I am back in town I won't miss Baby Cakes.
Eh, not too shabby.  It is what you would expect from a hippie kind of college place.  They have a lot of weird, natural type plates.  I had an open-faced sandwich with brie.  Too much brie but had some nice flavors.  A little pricey for lunch plates but again, it has more natural type foods than your typical greasy plates. I was up in the area for an interview but I could see myself being here many times in a semester if I went to Vassar. Try them out.
Remember that unseasonably gorgeous day last Saturday? Yea, well, I was sitting outside at Babycakes enjoying some tasty food. Honestly I was skeptical about the quinoa veggie burger but now I'm a convert. It was crispy on the outside (love the crisp) and very well made (in house). Got a salad on the side. My cohort had the soup and a beet salad and felt extremely satisfied. The coffee drinks and desserts are equally delectable.

I had a burger with goatcheese and it was delicious. Bun was mediocre and I didn't like the salad dressing. I had the Ruby Sipper tea and that was really good. The desserts looked amazing - don't waste your time on gelato when you can have one of their other amazing desserts! What a nice little place in Pouhkeepsie.
Amazing breakfast! I've gone to Babycakes twice and I have loved both meals I've gotten there. The waffles and the banana French toast are both incredible. By far the best I've ever had.
I really like Babycakes, but feel oddly uncomfortable here. It's the same sensation I get if trapped in the women's section of a department store, or accidentally wander into a restricted access area of a building; that "wooah I gotta get out of here" emotion sweeps over me.

Totally serviceable place for breakfast, but definitely not a leisurely brunch. The menu is OK, but we didn't see any standout, unusual menu items. Highlights include omelets, French toast, and frittata. Right across the street from campus. They do cafe-style service, so make sure you order at the counter, then find a table. I had the frittata, and my husband has the brioche French toast with bananas. Both were tasty, and if we were in town again, I would go back for their pastries, which are made on site and looked good, though we didn't sample any on this trip.
It was a bit busy, and the service a bit slow, but the sangria's fantastic don't cha know! The goat cheese appetizer whet my taste, and the salad was huge- surprisingly great! It's close to Vassar, so the location rocks. And the name drew me in- Babycakes is tops!
Stopped for breakfast. Good food but nothing out of the ordinary, and a bit pricey.

Came here a few times and was not disappointed. Great atmosphere, love the brunch menu, nice big cups of tea. The dishes I've had including the sanwiches are always well prepared, - it's a pet peeve of mine that when a sandwich or wrap is put together that the flavors be distributed evenly and they do that well. They  make a really nice blend of flavors in every bite. Fellow foodies know what I mean.
Definitely a trendy place for college students who want to impress just enough to make the mark, but not so much to splurge on an iffy date.

Read the reviews on Yelp and was a bit skeptical of the service we might receive (or not receive!).  Boy was I worried about nothing! The service was just as good as the food!  And the food was pretty damn good!  Saturday brunch, sitting outside, doesn't get much better than this.  We will be back, and often! Don't leave without a chocolate cookie.  They are awesome.

The food was pretty good.  I had a burger and my boyfriend had scallops.  The scallops plate was awesome, I wish I had gotten that.  The desserts were out of this world though.  I love the surrounding area and sitting outside was great.  It's also cute inside.
Good breakfast here.  Clean healthy living without too much fuss.  Good options for everyone in our party and polite and prompt waitstaff.  I would return anytime.
Love this dig - delightful little desserts, interesting coffee choices, and sometimes have surprisingly good beer specials and local brews. I've always had a pleasant experience here, and it appeals to the young, the old, and the college student all at the same time. Still haven't been to brunch, but perhaps the next time I'm venturing to Poughkeepsie I'll have to swing by.
I really want to love this place! Being new to the area and living a short walk away, I've been here several times now because it's got everything I want in a cafe: lots of vegetarian options, locally sourced ingredients, a vast drink menu, and cozy atmosphere. While a couple of dishes and experiences have been superb, overall meals and service has been mixed. The first time I went for Sunday morning brunch, and my omelette was decent, but the atmosphere - not the food -- brought me back for more. We've had dinner twice now, and the dinner service has been great, though slow (it was packed both times), and the food really good, but pricey. Again, the atmosphere is what keeps us going back because the vegetarian options are good... but not necessarily worth the price. This was confirmed for me when I went here for lunch takeout the other day. I was really psyched to try the Avocado Cheddar sandwich, which sounded delicious. But for $9.50, I was expecting a hearty portion. Instead, it was small sandwich bread, 4 chunks of avocado, and a very thin single slice of yellow cheddar that I almost couldn't taste. I've made better, more filling sandwiches at home with the same ingredients. Babycakes is great for a light dinner, drinks, or dessert, but for breakfast, lunch, or takeout, so far the results have been just OK.
Always happy to drop in here for a nice, healthy lunch. Mellow atmosphere with great coffee, nice twists on classic sandwiches & delicious soups. Wish I lived closer...
Nice place, but vegans need to be very particular in what they order. I think their main problem is that they have no idea how to prepare tofu. Definitely do not order anything with tofu and that alone will make your experience much better. This was my third visit, so I am sure of this. On my previous visits, I had the veggie burger which kind of fell apart and did not leave me feeling that I wanted to order it again. I also previously ordered the breakfast burrito with large squares of uncooked tofu. No sure why they didn't just sautee the tofu with all the other veggies. On this visit, we ordered two wraps for lunch - one a tofu curry wrap with fries and the other was eggplant with sauteed onions and portabella mushrooms and salad with balsamic dressing. Forget the tofu curry wrap - basically filled with large squares of raw tofu. I think if they just mashed up the tofu and mixed it in, it would have been so much more enjoyable. The fries were great, though, and we gobbled them right up. The eggplant wrap was good - it reminded me of a Philly cheesesteak (no soy cheese available in this restaurant, though). And the salad was good.  We both liked the balsamic dressing. We tried the white bean and kale soup which had this sour taste that ruined it, totally. The staff here is very nice and accommodating. This restaurant has so much potential, but for now, I think I will wait to return until they perfect their vegan dishes.
came here for a job interview.  we sat at the table near the bathroom but we might as well have been sitting in the bathroom cuz I could smell it.  For brunch I ordered some crepes which were okay but had more of a gelatinous quality than i would have liked.  It was obviously high in sugar and didn't really have fresh ingredients.  My girlfriend really had an awful experience.  They made her an iced tea which looked curdled and her chicken sandwich was "one of the worse meals" she's ever had in her life.  FAIL.
Lovely atmosphere & staff. Delicious desserts & good coffee.
Everything I've ever had here has been delicious - eggs, sandwiches, salads, desserts, all fantastic. My favorite lunch spot in Poughkeepsie and someplace where you can always try something new and always leave happy. If you don't have room for dessert, get something to go, you won't be disappointed.
Great food!
When you are sick of the campus coffee(which needless to say, is inevitable) stop by Bab Cakes Bakery for a break.  Their coffee, while not the finest coffee in the world, doesn't even compare to the burnt roast of the day at ACDC (all campus dining center).  There salads looks a lot better than they taste though, which is not to be said about their baked goods. The scones, croissants etc are delicious, this is def a great breakfast place. Try to go at odd hours though, while they expanded the seating, the line is five years long on a busy weekend morning. Oh and yes, they accept v-cash
It's a bit of a mish-mash. They have excellent pastries which are beautiful and tasty. It's a great place to stop for a coffee and pastry and to pick up pretty desserts for the house. But they try to do everything here, and the result is downright confusing! Bakery, coffee shop, breakfast, lunch, dinner, bar, nightclub, etc. Where/how to go about ordering your lunch which is different from how it's done at dinner, where the line begins, etc...it's just a bit of a jumble. Maybe it's just too early for me when I go in but I always find it more confusing then to needs to be. Be careful when ordering breakfast items--the pricing is odd and you can end up paying a ton of money for your omelette fillings. The pastries are better than the food, I recommend Babycakes for sweets and coffee over grub.
As a Marist student, I am more than willingly to take the drive over to Baby Cakes. What I love most is the comfortable, relaxed, atmosphere and of course the food and beverages they offer. You really can't go wrong with any coffee, meal or dessert. It's just a really cute place to go to if you want a light but filling lunch or to chat with a friend over coffee and a dessert. If they have the espresso cream puffs when you go, get them!
Went with a group and despite being busy they were very friendly and found us a spot to sit. Coffee was really good (I'm a bit of a snob on that front). I enjoyed a Tomato, Mozzarella, and Pesto sandwich. A little pricey like other folks noted but I'm from out of town and where I live, all we have is chains so I'm glad to pay a little more to support (and enjoy) an independent, local business.
An Arlington favorite serving casual bistro fare. The Vassar crowd lends a young vibrant flavor to the place.  The tight seating is usually full, and for good reason. Solid kitchen and young friendly staff. The place started as a bakery and the deserts showcase that legacy. definitely worth a stop if you are in the area.
"Woke up fell out of bed dragged a comb across my head found my way downstairs and drank a cup and looking up I noticed I was late..." -The Beatles If I went to bed at 2AM or later on the weekend, I would never be able to get my butt out of bed in time to get Belgian Waffles at Babycakes.  I would run out the door and by the time I would get to the counter, they'd tell me that they were out. Khhaaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnn!!!! However, if I stayed up the night before... We'd walk in, fairly sure we seemed alert and sober but we probably staggered in like winos fresh off a bender.  We'd grab the middle tables in this tiny nook and place our order, eagerly watching the clock until the waitstaff arrived with our meals. The food would arrive and we would dig in like a pack of starving hyenas, feasting before a pride of lions showed up to claim a prize. The chocolate croissants were a good subsitute if they didn't have the waffles.
Creative menu. Good coffee. Art and framed photography cluttering the walls (all for sale by local artists), ambient-lighting, and good service.
This is a great little place just off campus.  I like the Panera-style order-pay-food delivered, mostly because I hate to end a meal waiting for the check.  My breakfast (a waffle with fresh fruit, vanilla custard, and whipped cream) was delicious.  The waffle was nicely crisped up (noting worse than a limp waffle), and the vanilla custard was completely amazing.  The fresh fruit of the day was grapes (meh) and orange slices (on a waffle?), but it really only needed the vanilla custard to make my day!  The prices were Waffle House cheap, but this place is several steps above that in quality, and I felt like I got my money's worth.  We tried to go back for lunch, but it was packed with all of the alumni back for reunion, so we ended up going elsewhere, but next time I am back in town I won't miss Baby Cakes.
Remember that unseasonably gorgeous day last Saturday? Yea, well, I was sitting outside at Babycakes enjoying some tasty food. Honestly I was skeptical about the quinoa veggie burger but now I'm a convert. It was crispy on the outside (love the crisp) and very well made (in house). Got a salad on the side. My cohort had the soup and a beet salad and felt extremely satisfied. The coffee drinks and desserts are equally delectable.
I had a burger with goatcheese and it was delicious. Bun was mediocre and I didn't like the salad dressing. I had the Ruby Sipper tea and that was really good. The desserts looked amazing - don't waste your time on gelato when you can have one of their other amazing desserts! What a nice little place in Pouhkeepsie.
Amazing breakfast! I've gone to Babycakes twice and I have loved both meals I've gotten there. The waffles and the banana French toast are both incredible. By far the best I've ever had.
Totally serviceable place for breakfast, but definitely not a leisurely brunch. The menu is OK, but we didn't see any standout, unusual menu items. Highlights include omelets, French toast, and frittata. Right across the street from campus. They do cafe-style service, so make sure you order at the counter, then find a table. I had the frittata, and my husband has the brioche French toast with bananas. Both were tasty, and if we were in town again, I would go back for their pastries, which are made on site and looked good, though we didn't sample any on this trip.
Stopped for breakfast. Good food but nothing out of the ordinary, and a bit pricey.
Came here a few times and was not disappointed. Great atmosphere, love the brunch menu, nice big cups of tea. The dishes I've had including the sanwiches are always well prepared, - it's a pet peeve of mine that when a sandwich or wrap is put together that the flavors be distributed evenly and they do that well. They  make a really nice blend of flavors in every bite. Fellow foodies know what I mean.
Read the reviews on Yelp and was a bit skeptical of the service we might receive (or not receive!).  Boy was I worried about nothing! The service was just as good as the food!  And the food was pretty damn good!  Saturday brunch, sitting outside, doesn't get much better than this.  We will be back, and often! Don't leave without a chocolate cookie.  They are awesome.
The food was pretty good.  I had a burger and my boyfriend had scallops.  The scallops plate was awesome, I wish I had gotten that.  The desserts were out of this world though.  I love the surrounding area and sitting outside was great.  It's also cute inside.
Mmmmmm, love Babycakes. There are many things to love about Babycakes.  I am going to keep it short and sweet.  They offer a BLT with cheese and I love to order it with cheddar and fries and wine and, when I do that, I am happy for the next 24 hours.  Prices are so reasonable, service is perfect, and the food is heavenly.
In town visiting from NYC. Food is absolutely amazing and so is the staff!! Not sure what other people are talking about as far as the service not being up to par. I am a vegetarian, but my friends are not and they enjoyed it just as much. We had everything from appetizers to desserts and they have a great drink menu with house infused vodkas. Definitely worth going to!
Well if you are looking for overpriced and uninteresting food... this is the place to go. I had the worst roast beef sandwich I have ever had anywhere.  I have been there a few times and this time will be the last.... I must be a slow learner.  The only nice aspect is sitting outside in nice weather but that isnt enough to bring me back.
Great coffee, great breakfast and great atmosphere. I've been for lunch a few times but am a bigger fan of their breakfast fare. They have live music on the weekends and can be great if you catch the right group. It does tend to draw an older crowd but it's fun and the bar is stocked. Still my favorite coffee place in PK! (skip the chai though...bleeehhhh.)
We loved this place and would go all the time if it were in NYC. We know we will go back again during another vacation. Great music, service, and such good food for reasonable prices.  We stayed another night in the area just so we could eat here for dinner again.
Solid lunch/brunch spot, but it is a bit pricey for the self-service nature of the place.  It can also be a bit drafty.  Lovely in the summer to sit outside!
Delicious but do believe it is overpriced. Also on busier nights it may take a while. Unfortunately last time I went the service was sub par (waited quite a while before anyone coming to the table, had to flag down the waitress for things, forgot to bring us bread) but do think that is out of the ordinary. Love the food though so still go.
Went here for lunch during a weekday. Lots of students even towards the end of the school semester. Nice atmosphere with great decor. The sandwiches and wraps are nothing special but the baked goods are definitely worth the trip. Service was fast and courteous, no real complains. Overall a great cafe to meet with some friends to catch up.
Tonight (Saturday night) Babycakes Bakery & Cafe showed up on my Google Map iPhone App as I navigated my husband through Poughkeepsie.  After dinner we decided to check it out for dessert.  We split the Chocolate Strawberry Mousse Cake at the bar - very yummy and inexpensive.  The glass case of desserts all looked beautiful and yummy.  A drum & singer duo performed completing the coffee shop vibe.  It was a nice after dinner stop, worth checking out if your in Poughkeepsie.
I've been to Babycakes a number of times for both take-out and sit down meals.  The breakfast, lunch, and brunch menus offer consistently decent food.  Don't expect to be wowed by inventiveness, but the menu is still perfectly reliable.   The service here leaves a lot to be desired.  It seems as though they rest assured on the fact that they are right next to a college with a steady clientele and don't have attentive management to their front-of-house service.
Great food! Burgers are excellent. Portions are generous. A bit pricey for Poughkeepsie, but well worth it. Amazing desserts. Indoor and outdoor dining (weather permitting). Excellent quality. Highly recommend.
This little cafe is a nice spot with good desserts. I've had the cupcakes and tiramisu and they have both been good. My only complaint is that they don't make the Babycakes anymore. They were really good and filling. I've only had their regular food once but it's pretty good. I believe I had a pasta. The ambience is nice and cozy and espically when there's live jazz music. Go for the desserts, if not anything else.
FIERCE! Babycakes is one of the most unique experiences in Poughkeepsie. Smiling, friendly faces and top culinary graduates ensure the food and service never disappoints! It maintains a cute boutique cafe feel and I love the casualness of ordering at the counter and finding a seat (you're sure to meet someone new or run into friends!). Once the food arrives I am always impressed with the generous portions presented with style and superb taste (try the flourless chocolate decadence cake, OMG!). My friends and I not only enjoy their AMAZING brunch but dinner and drinks as well, the "S&P" martini is DELISH. 5 stars for Babycakes!
Best coffee in Poughkeepsie.....the coffee is great, especially when served in huge mugs.   The food is very good.   I especially love the creamy balsamic dressing.   The atmosphere is very very comfortable, have sat for hours just chatting over coffee.    Highly recommended!
Had lunch here today with my son and was very glad we weren't in a hurry. We both ordered burgers and waited quite a while. I was sitting where I could see the chef put our order up, but the waitress never came to pick it up. When she finally brought it to us the fries and burger were cold. We sent both back and they were quite apologetic. They made us new orders right away and they came to us piping hot. Both the burgers and fries were excellent and they gave us a desert on the house for our troubles. I wish they had got it right the first time, but it is very nice to find a place that will own up to their mistakes and make it right. If I'm in the area again we'll definitely go back.
Delicious fries, not a fan of the prices though.

Visit BabyCakes as often as I can.  I am a big fan of the cook's culinary treats.  I always enjoy myself and am in awe of how wonderful the waitstaff is.  It would help if the manager  (GREGG?)would appreciate his staff more and SPEAK TO THEM A BIT MORE HUMANLY.  Has the ower ever realized how the manger behaves? But don't turn away because the staff is fun and hardworking and the desserts are delicious (pricey, yes!) ......but still delicious.

I think Babycakes must have gone through a weird transitional phase a year or so ago, because it seems to have regained its charm.  This is among my favorite places to eat, and my favorite place to grab lunch during work.  In terms of the entrees & pastries, I don't think there is a single thing I've tried here that I haven't liked.  I've really enjoyed some of the new additions to the menu & pastry case, especially the salad specials (particularly the beet salad) and the caramel pretzel tart.  Babycakes is a little on the pricey side, but you do get what you pay for here.

Well thought out, simple menu, great food, kind people and as a result, a warm ambience  - right across from Vassar.  No wonder I feel like it would be my regular hangout if I lived here.  Thanks for the experience, Babycakes!

Typical college town cafe! Warm, inviting & friendly staff! The granola w/yogurt & fruit is a perfect mid morning brkfst!

started with their S&P cocktail - refreshing!  $7 cheese plate was enough for a meal....  one of the best veggie burgers I've had-got to find their recipe and their asparagus gratin was decadent....portions were huge, took much home, wait staff started slow but picked it up and was very friendly and accommodating

We had a late lunch at Babycakes this past Sunday. Located in a strip amongst several cafes and shops directly across the street from Vassar  College, Babycakes has a lovely sidewalk cafe and the interior is very clean and light-filled. The menu is pretty extensive with a small selection of vegan/vegetarian options. I had the vegan burger; composed of quinoa and potato, it's served open face on a slice of multigrain bread topped with lettuce tomato, and onion. The burger was good but fell apart and with one slice of multigrain you can't really make a sandwich out of it. I swapped out the salad for some tasty french fries. My boyfriend, an unwavering carnivore, thoroughly enjoyed the ham and brie sandwich. Portions are quite large and everything is fresh. Also, the restrooms are clean. I recall being told years ago by a public health inspector that you can tell a lot about how clean a restaurant actually is by visiting the restroom. Is there soap and HOT WATER (so employees can wash their hands)? The restrooms at Babycakes are very clean! I think they should add some more vegan options and they might do well to add proper waiter/waitress service. The young woman who brought our food to our table was a little surly but whatevs. Maybe she was having a lousy day.

Babycakes is a decent choice if you're near Vassar Good breakfast options to stay or go ( are they still planning to cater at Poughkeepsie train station?) Brunch can be crazy, I've waited for ages to be seated and left for other options several times Dinner is sometimes wonderful, sometimes not so, but the live Jazz the other night was great. They also showcase local art for sale on the walls which is great! I did host a big graduation lunch there a while back and they did a stellar job So if your close try and enjoy its a great place to have in the community
I've only had breakfast here, but have a few times.  It's never great, but it is consistently good!  The menu is simple but unique enough to keep us coming back.  I like a place that I can have a tap beer with my late breakfast.
I have been coming to Babycakes since it was just a bakery with no tables. All they did was breakfast and bakery stuff. And the lines used to be out the door. So it is, indeed, a Po-town (and Vassar...) staple. That being said, they've made the transition to full on sit-down establishment and done so pretty snappily. I don't love the decor, but the menu is both good and interesting (if a little bit pricey), the food is well executed and nicely presented,  and the service is generally pretty spot on as well. All things being equal, I'd probably still rather have a meal at the Beech next door, but if they're jammed and Babycakes is an option I'll march on over and be pretty happy about it. Although the Beech's taps are about 17x better.
I recently had the pleasure of dining at Babycakes with several yelpers, some who I knew and some I had the pleasure of meeting for the first time. I figured that Babycakes would be a good venue for such a gathering as they have enough variety, a good price point and the ability to accommodate a small sized group. It is a nice location and right at Vassar so the vibe is more hip than hip replacement (as I learned the difference recently at another restie but I digress...). The service was spotty though it was not particularly crowded and unfortunately one of our party had to send a dish back as it was too salty. My Vegetarian Muffaletta was just aight. Not great not terrible. Just A-OK in a good way. Unfortunately the bread pudding we brought home to share later was a bit dry and disappointing. I really want to love Babycakes but after several visits over the past many months it never seems to live up to the expectations I have for it. I would not not go back but I would not make it a destination either. Solid 3.03 stars. But 5 stars to my fellow yelpers who helped make any culinary shortcomings well worth it. It was a fun time and I hope to have the chance to yelp in person with you all again soon! youtube.com/watch?v=6vC3…
A college town breakfast joint that's weirdly precious about not substituting. If you order the croissant breakfast sandwich and they're out of croissants, you are out of luck for breakfast sandwiches. My companion asked, "you can't just put the eggs and cheese and sausage on bread?" Nope. Baffled, he ordered a frittata instead, which curiously came in cube format. I got the Rocky Mountain baked oatmeal, which also came in cube format. It needed a little brown sugar, so I asked for it. That's not so crazy a request for a breakfast-oriented place. The server returned from the kitchen with the message that there wasn't any "excess brown sugar." So if you're seeking food from the forefront of Poughkeepsie's no-compromises cubic cuisine scene... I guess go here.
(Preface:  This place is on my "Two-Week List," in which I list the top twenty restaurants and bars that I'd go to if some soothsayer came up to me and told me that I only had two weeks to live.  Check out the full list on my profile!) I cannot tell you the number of hours I spent here as an undergrad -- possibly more hours than I spent in the library.  They have something in their breakfast food that is actually addictive.  I don't know what it is.  But it should be outlawed.  My freshman fifteen were definitely due to Babycakes. The space used to be ridiculously small, with only a few tables, and when they expanded and added a bar, it was seriously better news to me than hearing that I'd passed my logic exam.  I AM NOT JOKING.   I have had everything on the menu, probably numerous times.  Breakfast is really fantastic here, but their sandwiches and soups are also superb.  And dinner -- their pumpkin ravioli (if they still have it!) is really out of this universe.  And get a pastry.  All of them. When we were seniors, my housemate and I would frequent the bar for a good glass of Nero d'Avola.  Gary the bartender was the best.  A lot of time there'd be live, folk-y music, too, or trivia-- an added touch.  My only complaint is that it closed at 11:00 PM on the weekends.   This is the perfect place to bring your parents when they visit (my mom still misses it... as do I!), an ideal place to grab coffee with your adviser, and great place to get to know a classmate better.  If you don't live in Poughkeepsie, it's a good reason to visit!!
This place is fairly bad and fails on multiple levels. When I got to a restaurant I want food that I can't easily make myself, unfortunately that does not apply here. I ordered the Tex Mex wrap and what I got was some scrambled eggs, a slice of cheese and a few slices of sauteed peppers. The meal was completely flavorless and needed hot sauce and ketchup to salvage it. Additionally the portions were very small for what most breakfast places give. I went there hungry and left still somewhat hungry. I almost wanted to order their french toast in addition but knew it wouldnt be worth it given how the wrap turned out. anyway I would recommend avoiding this place.
Recently paid Babycakes a visit with some other fabulous Yelpers for dinner.  When I joined my group, I noticed everyone was drinking water and there was a glass of water waiting for me.  When the waiter came by, they didn't ask if we wanted anything to drink.  I know I could have easily asked for something but  isn't that part of your job as a waiter to ask? Whatever, I'll stick to water. I ordered the Chipolte Chicken Sandwich with melted cheddar, lettuce, tomato, chipotle mayo on ciabatta. I got this with a salad.  Thankfully the dressing on the salad was delicious. I would tell you what dressing it was but the waiter did not ask if a) I wanted dressing and b) what my dressing options were - just take the dressing we give you and like it!!!   Did I like it? Yes I did, very much.  I got a carrot muffin for dessert to go which had good icing but the cake was a bit on the dry side.   I thought the setting and the way Babycakes was decorated was pretty cool and the  service was nice and friendly but not asking about drinks and dressing sat a bit weird for me.  Afterall this is a college spot, you may get some kids coming in who may not care for those things but you should still follow the standard restaurant procedure. It goes a long way.
I live and work right in the area and have been here many times, each time thinking that maybe I'll have a better experience. I have only had bad customer service, always with an attitude and it's terribly overpriced. $10 is not okay for a breakfast sandwich ($8 sandwich, we asked for avocado to be added. They added brown chunks of overripe avocado for $2). We won't be going back here, I recommend you find elsewhere as well!
Three of us met for breakfast here and for the most part, all enjoyed our food. The place doesn't have typical table service for breakfast/lunch and is run like a Panera, but with much higher prices. I always have mixed feelings about the place when I come here though. The service is chilly, prices are on the high side and the place is generally mobbed. This visit my frittata, though good, came out lukewarm and my toast was soggy. And my café latte was one of the worst I've ever tasted, though my husband said his café mocha was delicious. We've had better experiences eating dinner here.
I have never experienced such terrible customer accommodations in my life. I went with a group of friends and for some reason they refused to split the check by what we ordered (some of us ordered drinks and others didn't). Formerly, they gave separate checks.  The manager and owner were extremely rude and intent on angrily explaining their point of view, rather than trying to accommodate us. In addition, they automatically added a 18% gratuity into the check. The waitress, however, was apologetic and embarrassed by her managements actions. It was unnerving that the owner felt the need to continue an argument instead of resolving it. In my years of customer service I have always learned that the customer is right, obviously not at baby cakes. Never again will I return.
This is the best example of a casual well-priced restaurant that I would look for in any city or town. The food is delicious. I had the egg white omelette filled with veggies sautéed in a little olive oil and herbs. It was fabulous. The service was exceptionally pleasant. Micaran was our waitress and very attentive.  Choose from Inside or outside dining. Very good value; lunch for three with gazpacho, omelets and iced tea was $57 with tax.  That is under $20 for a satisfying and delicious meal in a pleasant ambience.
Ironically, I like everything about Babycakes except their signature dessert... I've had dinner at Babycakes several times and always enjoyed it.  Their beer list has enough variety to be decent without being extensive. Take advantage of the appetizer specials when they're available. My favorite is the Greek sliders. Nice variety on the entrees and specials. I like the menu desserts too, but I've never had luck with the babycakes themselves. They've always been too dry for my taste. I think it's because they're kept in the cooler, and you never know exactly how long they've been in there. Today I tried breakfast for the first time. That had caught my attention the past few dinner visits because of the huge write-up of the breakfast menu on the blackboard on the right as you walk in. I'd give breakfast 3 stars. You order breakfast at the counter, and they deliver it to you.  The whole-grain pancakes I ordered were good and accompanied by fresh blueberries and strawberries, but $9 for 2 pancakes seemed a bit steep.  Someone else ordered the banana brioche french toast, which was more flavorful and seemed a better deal.
Stopped by Vassar, and grabbed lunch at this restaurant facing the school campus. Gazpacho, salads and omelet were quite delicious. We sat outdoors at cafe tables on a beautiful summer day. The inside leaves a lot to be desired. The staff was friendly and service efficient. The menu options are pretty basic. If I am in Poughkeepsie again I would stop here for lunch.
I recently went back to Vassar for my college reunion and was very relieved to find the Babycakes Cafe as a good alternative to college campus food.  A few friends and I stumbled upon it while in desperate search for a drink after seeing a few too many college buddies now in possession of baby strollers. I can definitely recommend their martinis - especially the white grape and pomegranate ones, very yummy and the prices is definitely right (of course I may be a little skewed because my comparator is martini prices in New York and San Francisco). The wine by the glass was so-so. Although the pour was generous (maybe a function of 3 ladies making friends with the bartender), I didn't find the quality to be too outstanding. But the experience stood out so much that we returned the next day for brunch in order to avoid reliving the ACDC experience. I had the stuffed french toast, which was quite yummy and generous, as was my friend's frittata. The coffee is bottomless and unlike most other bottomless cup experiences actually isn't watered down and has some caffeine. The only downside here is that they don't have fresh OJ, as a matter of fact, you have to buy an individual bottle of Simply Orange, which I thought was a bit of a cop out. But overall, I thought it was a good experience. I appreciated their veggie and vegan selections. I definitely wish it was there when I was at Vassar!
Babycakes is one of those perfect little restaurants. Always reliable! Whether it's an appetizer or an entree, they don't disappoint! One of our favorite local spots!
The food is five stars, the service is good, it's a bit pricey but I understand that they use high quality ingredients. Breakfast is scrumptious and I often order take out for my office lunch. It is also delicious. Order the croque Monsieur - you won't regret it.
Let me preface this review by saying I've only been for brunch. So maybe dinner is the absolute cats pajamas, and I would be none the wiser.  But this review isn't about dinner. Its about brunch. Brunch. Brunch. Brunch! I freaking love brunch.  I'm constantly on the prowl for good spots to have a leisurely brunch with a gaggle of friends.  You know the kind of brunch that starts off innocent enough over coffee and eggs dissecting the drama of the week before... but slowly morphs into a "sunday session" and you suddenly find yourself accidentally tipsy at 3 pm off bloody marys? Yeah...Babycakes is not that place. I keep going wanting to love it.  And truly, there is nothing wrong with it at all. The food is pretty good. The coffee is good.  The service is... ehhhh... its ok.  The layout is a little awkward, when it gets crowded people swarming the counter and spilling over to the dining floor with tables just behind.  Needs some feng shui or something. Basically, its just not the place I want it to be. I can't quite place where it goes off the tracks.... but it does. Just a smidge. Its good but not great. I'll keep going there for lack of better options and for the reasons mentioned above (pretty good food & coffee) and the fact that they have some outdoor seating in the summer (although not nearly enough... but really, there aren't too many al fresco dining options in the city of Poughkeepsie, now are there?)
Had both a breakfast and a lunch here on my recent trip back to Vassar for my 10-year reunion.  My fiancé and I both got sandwiches for lunch, and then the following morning we came back for breakfast with a friend - and there were two frittatas and I think an omelette ordered.  All a great value, some interesting flavor combinations, fresh high-quality ingredients - all in all a great alternative to campus dining for students to have so easily accessible to them.
It's a cute place. I was a little confused when I first walked in because, having never been there before, I didn't know how the ordering system worked. Let me fill you in so you don't run into the same blunders I did. You may at first find yourself wanting to sit down at a table right away. Don't be deceived by the servers and bussers luring you tableward. First, place your order at the front counter. Approach with caution because if you stand too close too soon, you'll be asked for your order, which you may not have decided yet. Make your selection from the large chalkboard behind the counter, but be aware that the omelet filling selections are listed on the counter itself, taped near the register.   After placing your order, the cashier will present you with a number attached to a stand. You are now free to meander through the room looking for the perfect table, upon which you will place your numbered stand and hence your meal will find it's way to you. I hope you find the instruction helpful. Aside from the feeling of disorientation upon entry and the price of the food ($13 for and omelet and coffee) everything was fine. If I didn't care about the fact that I walked ten blocks for an over priced omelet that i could have made at home, i would go back in a heartbeat. So, if you are in the mood for a cute cafe and very hungry (the portions are huge btw) and  are not skilled in the culinary artistry that is omelet making, stop by Babycakes.
This is a really solid and great place to go. The food is as good as it gets here in the Hudson Valley - the Duck was perfectly cooked when I ordered it; and for Lunch the sandwiches are always quite inviting. I routinely go back here and always recommend this as a definite place to dine if you're in town for the weekend. Ambiance is really inviting as well; the only reason I'm giving this 4/5 and not 5/5 is because there are so many places now popping up around the Poughkeepsie scene I'd probably go to over this: Henrys at the Farm; Ice House; Artists Palate; Millhouse Brewery; etc.......But this is certainly a staple if you want some classic Hudson cuisine/
On paper it all sounds great. But the execution leaves a lot to be desired--especially at these prices. The atmosphere is cute and eclectic. During the day, it feels laid-back. I liked that there's a variety of seating in different sections: at the bar, tables, high-tops. An egg and cheese on croissant was oversized and underseasoned. The teriyaki chicken sandwich was also large, also underseasoned, and accompanied by a side salad soaked in dressing. The white bean soup had all the oomph of dishwater. On the positive side, the frittata was layered with veggies and topped with pesto. The fruit crepes--actually filled with sweet cheese--were lovely. My vanilla chai latte was perfect, and I hear that the hot chocolate is brilliant. I found the wait staff variable: Those at the register seemed to be killing time, while the runners/bussers were warm and friendly. I recommend sticking with the sweet stuff and beverages, and getting Mom and Dad to pay.
We have enjoyed our visit to this bustling cafe on a Saturday morning. We placed our orders at the counter and found a place to sit down while we waited for food to arrive. We had an eggplant wrap and a fried chicken with waffle. The eggplant wrap was tasty and healthy. The fried chicken had good flavor but had too much sodium. If the chef went easy on salt, then it would be  a perfect fried chicken dish.
Visited them again for lunch after few months break. Everybody's food were great (CURRIED TOFU WRAP, QUINOA SALAD). Deserts are just a little bit  pricey but they are very good quality as well.
The atmosphere in Babycakes is interesting. On the surface, it's your typical college cafe. Right across the street from Vassar, there are a lot of students sitting doing work and generally just hanging out. A few times I've seen people sitting at the counter watching sports which surprised me since it didn't strike me as the kind of place where would sit down and do that. I've also seen some older business-ey types come in getting breakfast or lunch. It's an interesting mix, and as a result a very cool place to people watch if you're into that. They make some damn good coffee, I'll give them that. I like the bottomless cup of coffee, but occasionally I order a latte or something stronger. Basically their whole breakfast menu is good-I really like the croissant breakfast sandwich with a side salad. I also like the croque monsieur-it's essentially a ham and cheese sandwich, but with some very runny, fancy cheese on it. It's delicious, and huge. I guess my only complaint would be that sometimes I find their menu  choices can be heavy, like it sits in your stomach for hours afterwards. It's tasty going down, but I don't know if I always like feeling I have a rock in my stomach later. Regardless, it's one of the best restaurants in the Vassar College area, and definitely a place to check out.
Every time I walk into this place, I linger in front of the display case full of desserts. I usually pick out a multi-fruit tart or the apple tart. But the food can be a hit or miss. I recently had the tex-mex wrap with scrambled eggs, peppers, salsa, onions and cheese. I ate all my orange slices and ate less than half of the wrap. I don't know. The wrap was lackluster. Another time, I ordered the avocado sandwich, which was just "eh." The service is stuck-up. One time, we were standing at the counter, waiting for someone to take our order. One female employee told a male employee at the cash register to do a task. He gave her a look and said he was leaving in five minutes. Here we were, standing in front of him and we're still waiting to be noticed. I can't remember who finally took our order, but my companion was pissed about the service. I keep thinking the food's going to be awesome here, that I'm going to have a great meal, but lately it hasn't happened. I do love the desserts, and that's why I keep coming back.
This place is nice and they let us chose where we wanted to sit. We had a great view, looking out at the park. The waitress we had was very nice, but  she was wearing the cafe's logo T-shirt and it was filthy & disgusting! I couldn't even look at her, because her shirt grossed me out. The food was good, not much on the menu and a bit pricey. We ate, sat and talked, we didn't feel rushed to leave (it wasn't crowd). I would go here again but hopeful the waitress would have cleaned her shirt representing the cafe.
Babycakes is actually three totally different places in one, and each gets 5 big stars from me. 1. Cafe: In the day, the cafe doesn't offer table service, but you order at the front, and the food is brought out to your table. They have a stand-out breakfast/brunch menu with tons of delicious and healthy vegetarian options. There are plenty of great sandwich and soup options too, but you'll probably find yourself distracted by the huge display case of delectable desserts and pastries, which are baked fresh daily. In the warmer months, there are a smattering of tables and chairs outside where you can enjoy a cup of their amazing espresso. And who doesn't love outdoor seating? 2. Restaurant: In the evening, the cafe shifts into a table-service restaurant with a friendly and competent wait staff. The food is inventive and tasty, especially with the addition of their new head chef. Even in our post-modern, carb-conscious, diet-crazed frenzy, everyone raves about the fried mac-n-cheese fritters. You should try them too... 3. Gay bar: Wait! What?! Yes, that's right. On Wednesday nights, B-Cakes turns into a local watering hole for the pink crowd. They dim the lights, and tipsy gays belly up to the fully stocked bar until well past midnight. There's a good mix of ages and genders, and the clientele is friendly and open. The jovial, older bartender, his twinky (straight?) bar hand, and the super-hot general manager make it *the* place to be on Wednesday nights. Three-for-one, Babycakes is the jewel in this little Arlington neighborhood of shops and restaurants.
