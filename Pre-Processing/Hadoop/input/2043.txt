DELICIOUS If you want teh realz Chinese foods, go here. In terms of price to quantity to taste, this place is unstoppable.
The high-rating reviews on Yelp attracted me here. The restaurant is small and the decorations inside are very Chinese  - red lanterns and a big picture of the Great Wall. We ordered noodles and fried leek dumplings. The taste were ordinary, I am afraid to say - suitable for a quick bite but not a grand dinner. Maybe other normal dishes are better, which we did not have chance to try since we were just driving by Buffalo. The price is really low and I especially like that! :P
It was really luck that brought me here. Honestly, this place is the definition of "hole in the wall" and I mean it in the best kind of way. It's located off the beaten path just north of Sheridan in Tonawanda. You know it's the real deal for mainly two reasons: 1. You walk in and your party is non-asian. 2. The joint next door is a chinese karaoke bar. The service is as the name of the establishment suggests. Importantly, there are two menus in which to order, the standard issue American style take-out and the authentic Chinese menu (for English see reverse). Hot tea is also available at the counter. Food is served Chinese family style sans personal plates, instead with bowls of white rice. The ma po tofu is among the tastiest I've had with small chunks of silky smooth tofu and spicy morsels of pork and spice. Everything is made fresh to order...even the spring rolls. Also highly recommend the eggplant with garlic sauce. If your in the mood for authentic style Chinese food look no further than Peking quick one.
Best and real Chinese food in buffalo! Try the Chinese menus and pick anything from it! You will never forget their flavors!
Food - 4 Service - 4 Price - 5 Ambiance - 3 (I usually eat Chinese @ home) Flavor galore peps! I honestly haven't had anything yet from here that I didnt like. I also eat here way to much. I only wish that they had egg rolls.
The best chinese cuisine in buffalo city.

I never would have came in here if someone wouldn't have brought me. It's a Chinese restaurant in a Tonawanda Plaza. Inside, it's not fancy. There are a few tables but you order all your food from the counter and they bring it over when it's ready. Along with the typical Chinese menu, they also have a home style menu too. I ordered the shredded pork with garlic sauce off the homestyle menu. My plate was full of shredded pork accompanied with a side of white rice. There were lots of red pepper pieces mixed into the thick sauce. The ratio of rice to sauce was perfect. I had enough for two meals off of this plate. My friend ordered the double cooked pork - which was basically a plate if spicy delicious thick bacon. I tried some but I'm not sure if I could handle eating just that - it was heavy. They had a lot of veggie choices too if you're into that.

Nice food. Didn't expect to find authentic Chinese food here in small town. Found it on yelp. You need to order from menu with only Chinese. It's 30 minutes away from the Falls.

Excellent quick service and delicious food. We always get the pork and cabbage steamed dumplings as an appetizer and they're too much food for two people! Plan on leftovers!

Peking Quick One is as good as it gets for a fast food Chinese restaurant.  The prices are rock bottom low and the food quality is always outstanding. They even have 2 menus, one in Chinese (which I assume is more authentic) and one in English (which I order from). Please, do the right thing and try this place!

BEST Chinese food in Buffalo, hands down. Right near my house too. Been coming here for about 4 years now :)

So I was introduced to this place by my wife's friend.  It seems like a lot of international students come here which is a good sign.  You need to go up to the counter to order.  Usually the house menu is sitting on the counter, but if it's not, ask for it.... this is where you'll find some of the more authentic dishes.  I noticed that almost every other table orders the fish stew and the double fried pork.  I'm not a huge fan of the fish but the pork is excellent.  The other dishes here are very good too.  The mabo tofu is done well but I don't like one of the spices they use.  If you see a small black ball in the mabo tofu, I would caution you about eating it.  It's okay if you do... no worries, but it will make your tongue feel weird for a few minutes.   You should also ask for a side of their pickled cabbage.  It's free if you ask, but they won't offer it to you if you don't.  Rice is also free as long as you're dining in.   There's a lot of stuff on their house menu and I'll be back to try some more.

Taking a cue from the name I'll make this a Quick One in the style of a fortune cookie, which you will not receive after your meal there because this place is legit: "Man who order off of secret Chinese menu will inherit a belly of delight" Learn Chinese:  àn baoshí (Hidden Gem) Lucky Numbers: 34, 5, 3, 21, 8, 13

Just moved to the area, so its walking distance from my house.  Was going to try the traditional menu until I read the reviews and found out about the authentic Chinese menu.  Good news.  The backside of the menu is in English!!!! I was worried we wouldn't be able to order from the menu since most people here noted it was in Chinese only.  The descriptions are a little vague, so you have to be willing to take a chance.  My fiance ordered the double cooked Spicy Pork.  It was AMAZING.  I'm not generally one for a lot of fat on my pork, but the way this was cooked was great.  The sauce was a great mixture of salty and spicy.  I order the steamed homemade noodles with a salty brown sauce (that is the description on the menu).  The sauce was great and the noodles were 100% homemade and tasty.  I loved that the dish was garnished with shredded carrots and cucumber.   Both dishes reheated beautifully.  A definite recommend! UPDATE: During the Blizzard of 2014, my fiance and I ordered from their regular menu.  We got the chicken wonton soup, fried wontons, chicken lo mein and szechuan beef. The young lady that cashed me out is super friendly.  The food was great, some of the best Americanized chinese food Ive had.  The portions were large for the price.  The quality of the meat and veggies were great and the sauces were all amazing!  We will definitely keep ordering from them.

I have only had a few items from this tiny little place in Tonawanda, but I plan to keep coming back for more! I had various items such as spicy shredded potatoes, double fried spicy pork, orange beef and the seaweed eggdrop soup. My favorite dish would have to be the double fried spicy pork because was pure sex in my mouth. It just had everything you wanted from a deep fried pork dish and of course I love anything spicy. The Orange beef wasnt anything too spectacular for me, maybe it was an off day, but it was really dry. The shredded potatoes were spicy and really kind of on the raw side - maybe cook them a little longer? My least favorite was the soup. I just feel like it needed something to it. I'm clearly not a homestyle chinese food connoisseur so I recommend taking the trip out and see what this place is all about

To start off, the menu may scare you... It's all in Chinese. I really wish they would print one in English. I went with a group of chinese friends who were able to read off what each item was. Once you order, the waiter marks it down and brings in a large plate for each item ordered. It's sort of like ordering dim sum except this is food. The veggies in this place are very delicious. However, I would recommend when ordering any meat, be wary of how much oil is on the meat plates. I tried to drip off the pork meat and bones as much as I could. I wouldn't come again here unless it was with my group of friends. It could make life difficult trying to figure out the menu. I will update my review if I ever go back. However, if you manage to understand the menu, order as many items as you want, this place is pretty cheap!!!

This restaurant uses A LOT OF SAUCE in their cooking. That may make food taste good, HOWEVER, It's better not to visit often for the sake of HEALTH.  They say they don't use MSG, the problem is a lot of sauce contains MSG in its nature. Their "fried leek dumplings" is good and probably the best one in Buffalo

Great food, feels like a home-cooked meal. I ordered off of the Chinese menu (I'm not Chinese and can't read a character), and got something that was some veggies (green beans, carrots, you know the stuff in standard Chinese fried rice), tofu (a lot!) with char siu (barbecued pork) inside and fried egg on the outside. Tastes great, doesn't feel oily, and price was very reasonable (about $6 for a huge portion, I only finished a third of it). I'll be back for sure.

This is the only restaurant with authentic northern Chinese food in the area. A staple for Chinese students around the area, we go there at least once a week. A little tip: bring a Chinese reading person to order from their Chinese menu.

Room is freezing. But the food is spicy hot. It's not friendly, but it's delicious. You might have to wait, but it's worth it. It's a small, charmless, neon lit room. No beer. No good tea. BUT there are handmade noodles with spicy brown sauce; handmade dumplings with pork and leek; insane spicy fish soup - fragrant with fresh cilantro, filled with tender fish. That's all on the English menu. Bring someone who can read Chinese (I don't know which dialect to recommend) and I bet it's mind numbingly great.

If you can read the Chinese menu of "authentic" foods or be patient enough to get help from the staff at this tiny take-out restaurant with few tables, then you are guaranteed some REAL Chinese food. The steady stream of Chinese customers AND American customers says it all.

I love their price, which is friendly. Every time I think of a cheap dinner, it's here without any doubt. Most of their dishes are about okay - good level, and the size is generous. My wife and I can eat for two meals if we take the dishes out. For me, what draws it back is the saltiness. I kind of have the Chinese restaurant syndrome every time I dined here (although they claim they do not use any MSG). But among the limited choices in the area, Peking Quick One is recommendable.

The BEST Chinese restaurant in Buffalo area ---- forget the 'Americanized' Chinese cuisine. Quick One really reminds of what I tasted in China, from Szechuan cuisine to Northern cuisine. The size is plenty and price is unbelievably low. I often went there with my Chinese classmates, with full stomach coming back, at the cost of only around $8 for each one! The only short is the small space, and you may have to wait for seats at rush hours if you haven't booked seats.

*UPDATE* I got the head-on shrimp. They're awesome! The shells are crusted in salt, and the shrimp themselves are slightly sweet, and just a hint salted.  My favorite form of shrimp is in cocktail form, and I'm a dunker, but I found these to be totally delicious without any dipping sauce.  I'm glad I was able to enjoy shellfish in yet another delicious form.

PQO is of the more authentic Chinese restaurants in Buffalo.  I had a cabbage pork dish that reminded me of homemade Chinese food.

Quick one used to be my most frequent chinese restaurant in Buffalo. However i haven't been back there for a long time due to my busy schedule. I have heard some bad reviews from my friends a while back but didn't get the chance to go back to try it out. Thus I decided to visit this place today to test it out satisfy my craving but I was really disappointed. The price of the food increase by at least $1, the portion is smaller than last time, and the food taste more horrible than last time. My friends and i couldn't even finish the seaweed egg drop soup that we ordered. Double cooked pork came in very little amount and charged us almost $10 for it, to make things worse, most of it are just fats. My friends and i will not go back to the restaurant anymore.

First meal after I arrived in Buffalo last week and it was decent. The food lacks variety of flavors. Out of the 8 dishes that were ordered, only one was not spicy and it was Honey Walnut Shrimp. Everything tasted pretty much the same, the spicy pork and the chicken dishes can't be differentiated. The menu is basically the standard Chinese takeout food but they cook it in large batches. Nothing special except the beef w/ onion, that was surprisingly good but that was about it.

Good, affordable Chinese food.  It's of a higher quality than is usually found at what I would consider Chinese "fast food" or take-out.  My only criticism is that the restaurant itself is a little small, and finding a table can be difficult during it's lunch or dinner rush periods.

This place is probably the most authentic Chinese restaurant I've ever eaten in and that's saying a lot because I've eaten in a lot of Chinese around the world. Their menu is not in English for crying out loud. It's quite small in there with around 10 tables only. Fortunately for us, it wasn't very busy on a Saturday night. We ended up ordering Szechuan Spicy Chicken, Poached Beef Noodle & Shredded Potato. They were all cooked to perfection and tasted really good. They give you a styrofoam cup to serve tea in which is nice. The waitstaff don't really wait on you so you'll have to go up the counter and ask for something if you need it. If you need a pitcher of water, feel free to grab one yourself from the refrigerator. The prices were also reasonable. We got those 3 dishes and bowls of rice for around $25. Cant recommend this place enough for authentic Chinese food but go with someone who's been here before or someone who can translate the menu for the best experience.
