The worst service. Sloooooooow. Waitress will forget you. I have no idea why I keep coming.
The food is surprisingly good for a dive bar (I'm a fan of the turkey sandwich, no sauce, added bacon). Also, their salads are surprisingly good. It's fun in the warmer months to fill the jukebox with the most obnoxious music you can think of and have an impromptu dance party on the porch. Speaking of which, the porch is extremely dog friendly, with little metal hooks to attach leashes to. The worst things about the place are probably the location and the times where the combined teeth of the patrons number less than the cars in the parking lot. Of course, that's when it's the BEST time to start playing Daft Punk or the Black-eyed Peas on the jukebox!
No problems at all here with the food, drinks, or service. It's just your basic bar and grill, and the food/beer is as you would expect. They have typical bar things like pool tables, darts, an outside patio, and different seating areas. The beer selection is not fancy but they do have a good mix of standards and a few craft beers from the area. The night we went, they had Ithaca Cascadilla and Hopshire Beehave on tap, among other things. The food is above average for bar food--they have some good burgers and fries! If you are craving such food after a couple beers, as we were, it really hits the spot. The fries are nice and crispy, and well-seasoned. The service was fast and friendly--I couldn't ask for anything more.
Hands down, best bar in Tompkins County. Order The Mel or Wicked Wedges Karaoke on Tuesdays Wing/Pizza Special on Thursdays F.U.B.A.R. Fridays, and the best people you will ever meet in a bar every night of the week. Trust me, I know what I'm talking about.
So I was very reluctant to give this place a try but I am glad I did. Went out on Saturday at about 4 in the afternoon and it was pretty dead which was fine with me. The server was nice but seemed like she might had been having a bad day. The atmosphere here isn't great, it's a bar after all and you can tell this place has been around for awhile. It was still pretty clean nonetheless and if it had been warmer I totally would've eaten outside as they have a great patio. I ordered a dozen garbage wings (mixed up all sauces) to start and they were pretty amazing. Might even be the best here in Ithaca. They were big and crunchy on the outside yet nice and juicy on the inside. My wife got the boneless wings with their garlic parm sauce and that was amazing, only had a little breading and a lot of chicken with those which is usually not something you get, usually it's all breading. I ordered the Jack Daniels burger for my entree as naturally my favorite burger in the world is the T.G.I.Fridays Jack Daniels Burger. It was huge, the patty was wide and thick which was great. The bun soaked up the juices but held itself together nice and firmly and didn't leak out the bottom. The onion rings on the burger were crispy not soggy, it came with 3 slices of bacon and the JD Sauce which was quite amazing. Now it tasted for like a bbq sauce mixed with JD but it was good! I ordered lettuce and tomato with my burger as in my opinion a burger is not a burger without them. The only regret I have about this burger was that I didn't order a side of the sauce as there was not enough on the burger though I love a lot of sauce on my burger. I had the Cajun French Fries on the side and by god they were amazing. I don't know what they put on the fries but these might had been the best fries I've ever had. They were hot, crunchy, and the seasoning was out of this world. A bit salty, spicy and you could definitely get those Cajun flavors. It was the perfect addition and they put a lot of fires on the side! The last reason this place gets a 5 star is because of the price, quality and quantity. The portions were huge, the prices were inexpensive, and the quality was amazing! Definitely get out and try this place, you won't regret it!
Just another local dive bar. They have lots of tables, so it can be a nice place to sit, drink your beer, and just hang out.  On Monday's they have 25 cent wings, which were okay even though they were a bit overcooked. The table service can be a little slow.

Tuesday night karaoke is gone but still there every other Saturday!

Seriously good sandwiches and fries. Stick to the sandwiches though.  I tried the prime rib one night and they could not get it right (it was packed in their defense).  Been there a dozen times and only one dud is not that bad.

The wings are great. Come on a monday, they have a great deal on wings and the beer is cheap too. It's best in the summer when you can sit out on the deck but inside has darts and pool which is always great. The fries and sandwiches are good too.

Definitely a local dive bar, but it has its points.  Some good food coming out of the kitchen and the Tuesday night wing special is a winner.   Outside deck seating is great but the inside could use a lot more work.  The Mens room is tiny and looks like it was converted from a large closet..  Owner tends to hover at the bar glaring at the bartenders to make sure they don't over-pour by a tenth of an ounce which is kind of creepy.  Giant TV behind the bar is nice for sports nights.  Check it out for music on the weekends sometime.  If you don't wear a trucker hat, you might stick out in the crowd.
