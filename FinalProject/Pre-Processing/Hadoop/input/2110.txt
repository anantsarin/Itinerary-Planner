We had such a great dining experience here that we came back the next night! The $12 steak and beer special offered at the bar is wonderful--an 8 oz steak (cooked perfectly) served with garlic mashed potatoes, Caesar salad and a roll, and comes with a beer of your choice. So yummy! We also ordered the lamb meatballs as an appetizers, and they were delicious. The service was great both nights. Servers were attentive, friendly and down-to-earth. Highly recommend and would be here every week if we lived nearby!

What a terrible place. (if you are not a local) It is supposed to be japanese cuisine but they were out of edamame (which they priced at $8.. the small paler). I looked to my bar neighbor plate and I could not believe his raw tuna (sashimi) was almost black. Food poisoning hello? I was surprised to seat at the bar in the company of a Mom sipping vodka with her two 14-years old teenagers. Maybe a Jamestown exception... i ordered a Caesar salad and a risotto. The salad was literally dripping in acid vinegar. Then I waited, and waited again. The risotto was no-show. I politely inquired three times  to be told "it is coming". During that time a few "locals" came, get drunk and were promptly served the night special, a steak dinner that even McDoldnad would not dare to give away. (remember it is a sushi place which special last night was a steak with french fries) I still don't know if the cook was desperately trying to defrost the seafood garnish for my risotto or if the statff was trying to send me a message I was not welcome. In fact, it was most likely pure incompetence and amateurism. I am glad I escaped unharmed. I ended up walking away 70 minutes after ordering. I still don't know why I left 15 bucks on the counter for a Gallo glass of chardonnay and three leaves of salad. Oh unfortunate Jamestown visitor, please, please avoid this dump.

We are from Canada and come to Jamestown almost every month of the year. This restaurant has sooooo much potential but it is so inconsistent. For many years we came and it was so wonderful. One of the servers "Matt" was the best you could ask for in a server. Always there for you. During these times we had a few not so good meals but he somehow made up for that and so did the restaurant. Now Matt has moved on to another job and the girl that took over for him is absolutely not the person you want to serve you. The maître de looked after us at first because she was not available. He was awesome but sorry we can't remember his name... Was it Rob? Anyway he got us our wine and told us of the specials and brought us bread. Then she took over. At first she was attentive but after getting us our food we never saw her again... I finally hunted her down at the bar so we could pay our bill. I asked her if she fell in a hole but all she could tell me was she was so busy. The maître de was there And apologized. I told him I was tired of hearing apologies from this restaurant. So long story short you might get good food you might not... But worse than that is you might get good service and you might not!

This was a good dining experience - there were a couple of minor flaws but those minor flaws kept it from being a FIVE. Let's start with what was right: the menu is eclectic; there's something for everybody. The food is flavorful and the portions are perfect. Whether you want small, medium, or large plates, you will likely be pleased with what you get. The decor at Christmas is interesting without being overly distracting. I thought the waitress could have done a better job -- she was nice enough but wasn't really clued in to our group of five. She (or the bartender) botched a relatively simple (but not routine) request for a children's "cocktail," she disappeared when it was time for us to have our plates cleared and bring the bill, and when she did bring the bill there was another table's $40 bottle of wine on it that had to be removed. Finally, we took my parents out for their anniversary and I mentioned that to the hostess when I made the reservation and there was nothing special provided. Let me be clear: a restaurant of this caliber in Jamestown is most welcome and they do so much right (as evidenced by all the rave reviews) and we'll be back. But one thing I've always insisted on with restaurants is that they recognize that every fine dining experience ought to be treated by management and staff as a special event. Instead, we more or less felt like we were ignored.

I have never had a bad meal at Forte, and the specials are always excellent! I usually shy away from ordering even the priciest steaks when I go out because they are typically never cooked correctly, but every time I have had the steak & beer special the steak has been cooked to perfection! This is always my first recommendation for anyone looking to have a nice dining experience in the Jamestown/Lakewood area, you get more than what you pay for!

Don't get the sushi!  Having heard from a local that "this was the best restaurant in Jamestown," my wife and I decided to have dinner here.  The menu was very intriguing with a great variety of items to choose from.  I decided on the seaweed salad and two sushi rolls; my wife had the celery root soup and the fish special, pink snapper.  My first clue should have been when I asked the waitress how many pieces were in the sushi rolls.  She responded, "8-10."  I thought wow, that's a lot of sushi.  So the seaweed salad arrived and it was actually pretty good.  Then about 25 minutes later, the sushi arrived.  I was starved.  The sushi was kinda weird looking.  The rice was on the outside and there was lots of it.  So I tried it.  The rice was this bland, gummy sort of paste that still managed to have some crunchy kernels in it.  And it had no flavor whatsoever - no rice vinegar, no nothing.  I had ordered a dynamite roll and the Philly roll.  I should have known I was in trouble when the plate for the dynamite roll arrived with "POW" written in a bland, ketchup-like sauce.  The filling for each of the rolls was equally bland.  (Did I mention that the sushi was bland?)  So I told our very nice server that the sushi was "weird" and not what I was expecting.  The maitre'd then came over to the table and explained to me that 1). this was "American"-style sushi and 2). the locals like large portions.  I told him that maybe they should state on the menu what "American"-style sushi meant to them.  (I'm guessing bland and lots of it).  He offered me other sushi but said that it would be more of the same, and I politely declined.  Oh, and my wife's soup was pretty good, but the sauce for the fish was way too sweet.  In a word, don't get the sushi!

Cozy atmosphere.  Amazing rice balls and seaweed salad.  Short ribs were too dry and fatty, but not too bad.  Great service and food overall.

Here are the basics as I currently see them if you are thinking of giving Forte a try: 1) They get very busy and the bar is long and narrow with tables against the opposite wall, so if you aren't looking for a crowd... don't go on the weekends. It is difficult to navigate. If you are looking for a place to socialize, Forte will be busy. Reservations are a good idea. 2) The food is great and Julie is an amazing chef. She infuses many different flavors and does interesting combinations of very unique and palatable flavors. If you are looking for something unique, this is the place to go in Jamestown. 3) They have sushi, yes. But it is basic and the prices are higher then you will find in other larger cities. However, as the owner helped me understand, there is a small market in Jamestown and getting the ingredients fresh is pricey. 4) Wednesday night they have Trivia late night (around 10:00 or later) and it is a good night to have a relaxing dinner without the place being packed if you come a little earlier.

Okay, I know right off the bat that you're all going to hate me. I know that I'm the only person who has given your beloved Forte a two star review. The thing I can't understand is Why? I came here the other night because I was in town visiting family and a friend had flown in with me for a few days. I showed her the Jamestown "classics", such as Ecklof's, AJ's and Davidson's. I had heard about Forte and everyone loved it SO much that I thought it was going to be a sure hit. "Sure miss" was what I got. Now, I'm a native. I consider Jamestown my home. There are amazing foods in this town that I can't find anywhere else...but you people MUST have different tastebuds, because for the life of me, I can't figure out why you're all so crack-addict about this place. We ordered some drinks and sushi to start off. Now, a Cosmo was only $5, so "A'ight." for cheap drinks. I'm not sure if their drinks are cheaper because they're trying to get people buzzed enough to not notice the poor excuse of whatever it is that they're trying to pass off as sushi, but my guess is "Yes". We ordered a spider roll, which was nothing but soft shell crab and spicy mayo. What we got was a shrimp tempura roll, light on the shrimp, extra heavy on the tempura. There was literally no meat in the middle of the roll. It went TEMPURA!!!, seaweed, rice. When my companion told the waiter that it was chewy and not what we ordered, he explained to us that soft shell crab comes in a soft shell (thanks, Captain Obvious!) and that's what we were eating. He had no shot at defending the chef, however, since there were SHRIMP TAILS sticking out the end of each roll. Dude be trippin'. (It is possible that I am just a sushi snob because I live in California and sushi makes up half of my diet on a good month, but this just irritated the bejeesus outta me. I was also shocked that they would charge so much ($10 a roll??) for nasty sushi. I eats me a lot of sushi and for $10 in Jamestown, that roll better walk itself out of the kitchen and hand me my chopsticks itself. $10. PLEASE. ) After we had been sitting down for awhile, two couples came and sat down at the table next to us. It was like a game of "Which one of these is not like the other?" with these four. Three of them looked 'normal', conservatively dressed and in the mindset to be outside. The fourth one looked like a 50 year old remake of Dominatrix Barbie. She had the long, bleach-blonde hair, the HUGE OctoMom lips and boobies that were ready to jump out of her tube top. THIS LADY BE OUT HER MIND - tube top! It was November, at night, in New York..and it was raining. I know that Forte can't control the kind of customers they get, but there were a lot of other empty tables and having that much plastic right in our faces really killed the mood. Aside from the sushi, we ordered the Chicken Saltimbocca and the Caraway Pork. The chicken was reaallly close to being dry beyond rescue. The prosciutto it was wrapped in was jerky-tough. It came with risotto and asparagus, which was odd, since nowhere on the menu did it mention asparagus, but whatevs. The risotto tasted like it was out of a box. (I mentioned the asparagus not being on the menu because it seemed like their menu should have said, "This will kind of give you an idea of what you'll get, but we're probably going to change it around on you, so here's hoping you don't have any allergies!".) My friend's pork was okay, but it came with some CRAZY horseradish mashed potatoes and "harvest" vegetables. Her whole dish was tan/brown. Gordon Ramsay would have shat his pants looking at it. The potatoes reeked of garlic and tasted like pickles. Strange. After the sushi debacle, our waiter, Matt, was kind of on edge towards us, which was weird, because (now I understand if you don't believe me) we were polite. (We's don't be messing with those who touches our foods.) He just kind of took off and never showed up until the end. NO GOOD. I wish this place had stepped up and delivered. I'm all for people trying to do something new, but Forte gives out a very loud vibe that someone who hasn't been anywhere is trying very hard to impress other people that haven't been anywhere. I had high hopes for Forte. Maybe we caught them on an off night. Maybe their chef had been sampling the wines and overcooked/overseasoned our food. Maybe Matty's girlfriend just told him she was pregnant with triplets and he done went crazy and forgot his seafoods. Maybe the wanker who decided to charge $6 for a side of brocolli doesn't like it and thought if he overpriced it, he wouldn't have to cook it that much.  I don't know. I can tell you that this place is pretentious for Jamestown. If the food weren't so overpriced, I'd give it a second shot, but at $24 for a piece of dry chicken and risotto out of a box, I'll pass. My advice to Forte: Until you know what you are, stop trying so hard to pass for something you're not.

I thought in Jamestown that Yelp was my little dirty secret. Not so. When you get to go to a nice restaurant in a small town like Jamestown, yes, it is not Yelp-safe. IT WILL BE REVIEWED. My aunt is friends with the owners. Before you give me flack, Jamestown is a small town and everyone pretty much knows everybody. The chef is from Boston. The interior albeit I was fresh off the plane from SF, made me feel like I was in SF again. Rich burgundy walls, loaned from the local theater -my aunt told me-curtains, a nice wooden bar straight out of an Irish pub, friendly service, and a full service bar, complete with local artists' work on the walls. After visiting off and on from childhood, this is a side of Jamestown I have never seen. Fine Dining. What a pleasant surprise. The wine list is funny. Most of everything is from California or Australia. There was one French wine, but wasn't that great. The wine I did settle on, was reminiscent of the Ad Hoc-Yountville variety. The menu is a variety of choices, it's the strong point of it. I can choose spring rolls,  sushi, soup, and bbq ribs if I wanted. I tried the spinach ravioli. They were handmade with a wonderful sage cream sauce. It was quite a nice start for a dinner with my relatives. My aunt got the crab cakes which were also very good. The special on the chalkboard was my favorite-as it was reminding of all things San Franciscan, most importantly that all things good must be bacon-wrapped. Anything wrapped in bacon gets a gold star on the forehead of a good chefy. This place is popular and quite a surprise for me that in such a small town where Tops, Quality Market, the smallest mall in the world with a Bon Ton (a crappy excuse for a Macy's) and the largest Wall Mart known to man, that yes. There is a little haven in one of my hometowns for a foodie like me.

Forte's amazes me. I live in South Florida, travel throughout South America and I'm used to the best of the best in ceviche. In a city with an ethnic heritage like Jamestown, I would expect great Swedish Meatballs, Korv or any Italian pasta delight, but a great ceviche? No way! But, to my delight and surprise I had one of the finest tasting dishes of ceviche ever. To top that off, I also had one of the finest, most delicious filet mignons ever; most exquisitely prepared. To have a fine meal like this, particularly in an area known for offering little more than subsistence food, came as a shocking surprise. Where the culinary artistry of most restaurants fade with age, Forte's continues to improve. Hence I've had to up my rating from Four to the coveted Five Star.

On my second week out in Chautauqua, I was really looking forward to trying a restaurant called the Labrynth Press Company, which as it turns out, is a lunch place, not a dinner place. So we strolled around the corner and into Forte, and were quite glad that we did. Good reviews all around.  The atmosphere was nice- lots of interesting decor, good colors, relaxing music, different layout etc. The menu offered some interesting choices, which was a nice change.  Many of the restaurants we'd seen in Chautauqua had very limited options for vegetarians. We weren't sure where to start, but decided that with the stressful day we'd had, the Mac & Cheese boat was a good start.  I am not even sure how to put this app into words, but the word orgasmic does come to mind.  I don't even like gorgonzola cheese, and in this dish, I wanted to marry it- amazing. For my meal, I ordered the falafel burger, which came with a side of tabouleh and a small salad.  The tabouleh wasn't the best I've had.  It wasn't bad, but it could have had a bit more flavor.  On the other hand, the salad was perfectly fresh spring leaves dressed with the perfect balsamic dressing.   The falafel was also delicious.  A little drier than I would have opted for, but that's a common complaint for me.  It was topped with fresh lettuce, tomatoes and some delicious spread on the ciabatta bread.  Outstanding. My only complaint is that the food was so good I couldn't save room for dessert.  If I am ever back in Chautauqua, I will be returning to Forte. Oh, and I almost forgot to mention the bread.  Prior to the meal we were brought warm, chewy fresh bread that we dipped in some of the best olive oil ever.  There was fresh basil in the bottle, and the oil had absorbed so much of the flavor, you almost didn't need the cracked pepper. Delicious.

Good reviews all around.  The atmosphere was nice- lots of interesting decor, good colors, relaxing music, different layout etc. The menu offered some interesting choices, which was a nice change.  Many of the restaurants we'd seen in Chautauqua had very limited options for vegetarians. We weren't sure where to start, but decided that with the stressful day we'd had, the Mac & Cheese boat was a good start.  I am not even sure how to put this app into words, but the word orgasmic does come to mind.  I don't even like gorgonzola cheese, and in this dish, I wanted to marry it- amazing. For my meal, I ordered the falafel burger, which came with a side of tabouleh and a small salad.  The tabouleh wasn't the best I've had.  It wasn't bad, but it could have had a bit more flavor.  On the other hand, the salad was perfectly fresh spring leaves dressed with the perfect balsamic dressing.   The falafel was also delicious.  A little drier than I would have opted for, but that's a common complaint for me.  It was topped with fresh lettuce, tomatoes and some delicious spread on the ciabatta bread.  Outstanding. My only complaint is that the food was so good I couldn't save room for dessert.  If I am ever back in Chautauqua, I will be returning to Forte. Oh, and I almost forgot to mention the bread.  Prior to the meal we were brought warm, chewy fresh bread that we dipped in some of the best olive oil ever.  There was fresh basil in the bottle, and the oil had absorbed so much of the flavor, you almost didn't need the cracked pepper. Delicious.
I think Forte is a wonderful thing for Jamestown and certainly brings something cool and trendy to the downtown scene.  Not to mention much needed diversification in the mostly abysmal dining options available in Jamestown.  A+ for that.   My experience with the food and service were good.  I do have to agree with other reviewers about the sushi.  If you are a major fan of sushi and have experienced really good sushi, you will want to order something else.

Welllllll, Maybe it was an off night?  I'm going to have to agree with the other 2 star rater...why so many 5 stars reviews? Some people I work with just raved about this place so we went to have dinner. I ordered the crab cakes (let's just say I'm on a crab cake mission)...which were burned to a char on the bottom. We tried the calamari and it was nothing to write home about-chewy if anything. I tasted someones curry dish and that was nice. Tasted one of the tuna wonton things and it was fine. My martini was served in a broken glass (large chunk missing on the lip), once I pointed it out to the server he replaced it immediately. I guess my issue is with quality control. If I do go back I guess it's best to stick to steak?!?! One of my fellow diners kept saying- isn't this just the best food??? Frankly no, more the story of a big fish in a small bowl.
(Review reflects previous owner) Casual, upscale dining.  It's probably the trendiest dining establishment in Jamestown.  The one-page menu changes daily.  It's the only restaurant in Chautauqua County that offers sushi somewhat regularly (no sushi on Tuesdays).   The one complaint I'd have about Forte is that the offerings are inconsistent with what's actually printed on the menu.  On more than one occasion, the kitchen was already out of an item (shrimp-based dish) that was listed on the menu very early in the evening.  This just might be a winter phenomenon. We've always had a good meal there, whether it was a special occasion or just a mean craving for some seafood.  Service is quite good and what you'd expect in a nicer restaurant.  The atmosphere has a bigger city feel to it and you can often hear Stereolab playing on the sound system. Since it's located next door to the Reg Lenna Civic Center, be sure to make reservations if you're planning on going to dinner the same night as an event at the Center (music, movie, or otherwise).

Forte is worth visiting Jamestown for. Sure, you might go for family, like I do, or because you're a Lucille Ball fan, like many do. But Forte is the best restaurant I've ever been to, and is worth traveling for. Chef Ian Anderson is a wizard. I'm lucky enough to call him a friend now, and the last few times I've been in town, I've let him decide my order for me. I've never had anything he prepared that I didn't find magical.  He's the real deal. The bartenders and waitstaff are funny and hip. Owner/operator Peggy is friendly and very community oriented. This is casual dress, hip, fine dining. It can be pricey, but they do have bar specials for those who can't afford a $20 meal. Heck, they usually have a $10 steak and a beer special. I can't say enough good things about Forte.  I really consider it to be the best restaurant I've ever eaten in.
I'm not sure Forte knows what it is, but I don't care at all.  I will be very supportive of them during this time in its life.  Everyone goes through an experimental phase, after all, and I will be behind them as they offer sushi, mac'n'cheese, sausage-stuffed chicken, and paninis to patrons in their dark but inviting confines. If I was to categorize Forte as something, I suppose it would have to be "eclectic and hip date place."  I mean, I wouldn't take a business partner there, or a family member there.  But a date, yeah.  You can take a date there.  Have a drink at their lovely bar, then sit and be served from their exceedingly diverse menu by a friendly and informed waiter. Despite Forte's identity crisis, they still do everything pretty well.  The Dynamite Roll (salmon, spicy mayo, tempura flake, playfully plated) was a solid B-.  The sandwich special for the day (chicken with roasted red pepper aoili) was a tad mushy, but very flavorful and dressed nicely.  And when I requested a caesar salad instead of homemade chips on the side, they gave me both, and they were both tasty. Overall, I'd come back if I happened to find myself in Jamestown again.  And if not, I will support them from afar, telling others to stop by and see this fun little place during its seemingly unending period of figuring itself out.

Despite the fact that this place has some identify issues (one part bar, one part sushi restaurant, one part upscale pub grub??) I still really liked it. I got the sausage stuffed chicken which was divine. The sausage and chicken were moist and surrounded by a creamy cheese sauce. YUM. The roasted fingerlings potatoes it came with were great too, very flavorful and cooked perfectly. The side salad was nice and huge. The service was great, very friendly. Price was a hair under what I expected to pay, bonus. The entire space is really cool, great vibe. The ladies restroom was so cute; it had hairspray, bobbypins, lotion, tampons, etc. for the taking. A nice touch.

Found my vegetarian self in Jamestown with an empty stomach. Two locals pointed me to Forte, and I'm glad they did. The place was reservation only on a Friday night , but luckily another group was finishing up at the bar. All of our food was really good, but overpriced for the most part. I would definitely come back to try the sushi.

Unexpectedly found myself in Jamestown, NY on a rush visit to see my grandmother before she left us. Spent all day at the hospital down the road. My dad was with me and we had had a long trip out from Los Angeles, and an equally trying day. I wanted to cheer my father up and spend some good time together after we left the hospital, so I jumped on Yelp to see what the locals recommended as a good dinner spot. Forte came up with great reviews, and for good reason. Though we did not expect it to be packed on a Tuesday night, it was; so we ended up dining at the bar, which was fine, because the bar service was great and the atmosphere was as good there as in the dining room. Had some great cocktails & enjoyed a fab dinner with my dad. The wine-by-the-glass list could be improved upon and expanded, but that was my only "meh" moment with the place. Not a deal breaker. If they kicked it up though, it would be stellar. Dad had their Cajun scallops with risotto, and I had their very healthy "Greens and Beans" plate. The quality of the food for the value was on par. Only thing that was a little odd was the "oh-yeah-by-the-way-we-also-have-sushi" menu. The fish in the small sq.ftg. was a little over powering when we first got there, but we quickly got over it. Scallops were perfect. The Beans and Greens should be touted more because it was a perfect vegetarian dish. Tasty, hearty, warm, full flavored and very satisfying. Nothing heavy or rich about it, just good comfort food, which is what I needed. I hope if I ever make it back to Jamestown, I can visit Forte again. They are putting local "social" dining on the map in that sweet little town and I'd love to see where they go with it. It was the right choice for a great evening out with my dad, in celebration of the spirit of one very special lady. . .

Very excellent atmosphere and all though not a huge sushi fan quite an extensive sushi menu. No need to worry your little head the menu is packed with exciting dining ventures. The staff goes above and beyond without being overly obnoxious. A favorite with me.

A refreshing new restaurant in Jamestown.  Almost makes you feel like you're dining in Soho.   Try the Cyclops Cabernet.  It is very good. The edamame appetizer is also worth trying. It's great that Forte has both the regular dinner menu and a sushi/shashimi menu with other Asian specialties.   I had the Thai Lettuce Wraps.  I was served strips of grilled chicken to fill my romaine hearts.  Very fun dish.  The thai peanut sauce was delicious.  I would definitely order this again.

It's the best place to eat in Jamestown. In the same vein as Papa Johns being the best pizza outside of NYC. Pros: Great beers on tap and decent happy hour specials in the bar Cons: The quality of ingredients isn't that great. Stick to the bar.

fortetherestaurant.com/f… If you are in Jamestown or the surrounding area, Forte is a MUST.  This is hard for me to review b/c it could get too lengthy.  A San Fran twist in a Lucy Ball town.  While the $10 steak and beer bar special is serviceable, you might want to order off the big kids menu.  From apps like Tuna Crisp or Mac-n-Cheese boat, Coconut Shrimp Sushi Roll or Spicy Shells, the options are endless (+ a nice sushi selection).  Entree menu is crazy and suits all pallets, from seafood lovers (Linguine w/ Clams), to meat lovers (Filet Mignon Au Poivre), to vegetarians delight (Beans and Greens).  I've had them all and suggest you stop in to the visit the great staff and have a good local beer (Southern Tier).  Happy eats.

Definitely my all-time favorite restaurant and after-work destination. The prices are fantastic, the food is great, they keep it local with awesome Southern Tier beers on tap, and the atmosphere combines small-town friendliness and charm with big-city ritz and class. I used to always get the $10 steak-and-beer special. (Is it $12 now?) It was a good steak; nothing exceptional, but a solid slab of beef. (On the other hand, the Kobe burgers ARE exceptional.) What made it stand out as a meal, though, was a delicious side of mashed potatoes, a mixed baby greens salad, a tasty toasted roll, and a bottle of beer of my choice -- all for $10. ($10!) After moving out of the area, I drive my friends the hour and a half to Jamestown so they can experience Forte, and they're never disappointed, especially with the sea food selections. Few Buffalo restaurants can compare. I'm no sushi expert, so other reviews may be more helpful in that department, but the tuna roll was very good from the point of view of someone who doesn't often dabble in sushi. Their appetizers are terrific; I highly recommend the delectable mac and cheese boats. As for entrees, their menu has wonderfully evolved over the years; the last time I went, the Chicken Milanese was very tasty. All in all, Forte is worthy of the hype. It's the best happy hour destination I've ever experienced, and it's not just the best restaurant in Jamestown. It's one of the best restaurants in Western New York.

I went to Forte for the first time at on 12/23/10, the food was GREAT, but the service not so much. We came in at 8:30, found a table in the bar area and waited to be served, it was busy, but not crowded, finally at 8:55 our server comes back and tells us that the order has to be in the computer by 9:00 otherwise we can't have anything which we were a little offended by having to wait 20 minutes for him to come back (we weren't even asked for our drink orders the first time), and in a small town you take the business when you can get it. Well we put in a quick appetizer order, and it was great, and after we moved over to the bar. What really upset us, was that come later on that night, there was an open buffet, customer appreciation we were told, which was great! But it did upset us that much more we couldn't have ordered our dinner since obviously the cooks were still working in the back for another hour after 9. Getting bar service, is pretty close to impossible, most places if you have a drink nearly empty or even when you put the empty bottle/glass out to the inside of the bar, the bartender is there to get another, not so much here it seems at Forte. This is a great little place with amazing food, but it has a lot of growing to do, and the management needs to look into really training the wait and bar staff! Once that happens, it'll be a gem.

Our 2nd time at Forte. It did not disappoint. We dined there on Saturday , 9/28.  My wife had the sea bass & I had the black bean burger. We both the soup which was wonderful. Wines were very good.  Excellent presentation - see the photos. Pricey, but the service. & food lives up to the price.

I come to Jamestown several times a year and I always visit Forte at least once each trip.  Their Prime Rib special can't be beat!  I usually get a sushi roll, because it fills be up perfectly.  As a native Californian who has a ton of sushi restaurants to pick from, I was leery about trying the sushi here, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The service at the bar is lovely. This place is a MUST if you are in Jamestown.

There has not been a single disappointing experience at Forte. From their variety of southern tier beers on tap, lounge $12 steak & beer dinner special, sophisticated spin on macaroni & cheese, to delicious hand rolled sushi, there is something for everyone!

Can't believe the lady at the Hampton Inn recommended such a great place! Very eclectic fusion of different food styles. We walked right in at 6pm on a Wed night and sat right down. Great, laid back, cool ambiance. Try the Prusciutto Feta ravioli w/ figs. Wild!

I was recently in the area on business and decided to check out Forte based largely on Yelp reviews. Coworkers and I stopped in on a Tuesday evening and were told they couldn't seat three until 8 PM (90 minutes later). We made reservations for the following evening and I'm glad we did. Forte is a lovely little restaurant ("little" being key when trying to get in with no reservation) in downtown Jamestown. I got the tortilla soup as an appetizer. It was good, but not the best I've had. As an entree, I got the blackened tuna and it was quite good. It could have been a little warmer, but it's hard to keep medium rare tuna warm without over-cooking. My colleagues both got the strip steak specials and loved them. One was a little undercooked (MR instead of MED), but it was delicious. Wine selection was good and our server was attentive. Overall, I would highly recommend Forte; however, MAKE RESERVATIONS!

Forte is no longer a well kept secret ... it has grown so in popularity that it is tough to be seated without a reservation even on a weeknight.  Love the casual sophistication ... approachable yet refined.  Deliciously fresh and inventive sushi, and the appetizer menu rivals the entrees for quality and variety.  Best bet for modern and eclectic dining in the Jamestown area.

Without a doubt this is the best restaurant in Jamestown and the second best in Chautauqua County.  (Brick Room in Fredonia is my favorite!)   The $10 steak special includes a salad and beer and is only served in the bar area.  Very supportive of the excellent local Southern Tier Brewing Company beers brewed in nearby Busti.  It's the only real Sushi place that I'm aware of. (Wegmans does not count...but it's good too.)  There is nothing on the menu that I would be afraid to recommend.  The place is truly NYC in Jamestown, NY.  HEY...better reserve to avoid disapointment.

I've been to Fortes twice in the last 3 years. The first time I was blown away since I'm used to Los Angeles 5 star restaurants & Beverly Hills prices. I also have a home 1/2 hour driving from Jamestown, NY so I am certainly far from a visitor. These prices were Beverly Hills prices and at first well worth it. The second time, the  original Chef left that had previously been there . I was so upset. I had invited 4 more people raving about the restaurant. Now What ! The first time we ate there at Fortes  we loved it. The second time it was good but now 4 stars. Disappointed because we thought the food was really the   " Chef " but we stayed and I was very pleased but now a 4 star. We followed the Chef the 3rd time to the " new restaurant ". Yuk ! It  was so horrible & I took 2 other couples to the new restaurant. Can't remember the name right now. That's how impressed I was. It was an embarrassment to my friends. I was angry because for 6 people it was over  $400.00 in a small town where the average ticket for a 5 star restaurant for 6 people steak, lobster etc would be $ 150.00 I'm going back to Fortes tomorrow night 06./ 02 / /2012. Tune in. I'll let you know. The price for 4 adults including 2 drinks each + coffee should be around $ 250.00
I've been to Fortes twice in the last 3 years. The first time I was blown away since I'm used to Los Angeles 5 star restaurants & Beverly Hills prices. I also have a home 1/2 hour driving from Jamestown, NY so I am certainly far from a visitor. These prices were Beverly Hills prices and at first well worth it. The second time, the  original Chef left that had previously been there . I was so upset. I had invited 4 more people raving about the restaurant. Now What ! The first time we ate there at Fortes  we loved it. The second time it was good but now 4 stars. Disappointed because we thought the food was really the   " Chef " but we stayed and I was very pleased but now a 4 star. We followed the Chef the 3rd time to the " new restaurant ". Yuk !

THE BEST SPECIAL IN TOWN! The steak and beer deal is tasty and you can't beat it for $12.

I'm from San Diego. I started with a glass of J Lohr cabernet, wonderful! Atmosphere is incredible, LOVE it!  Had the roasted beet salad, it was great! I would have loved more greens with it, but the beets were delicious. Now for the bad news...Don't want to be a snob, but the sushi maker needs to visit a west coast sushi bar. The rice wasn't sticky rice, but small-grain rice. I ordered a Cali roll, and it wasn't like a Cali roll in....well...CALI. Out "there," we have sticky rice, seasoned crab salad (as opposed to a piece of cooked crab or imitation crab meat), avocado (I'm not sure it was avocado in there, could have been), seaweed, and sticky rice on the outside, about 3/4 inch piece, 5-6 (maybe 8, at most) a serving. I got a lot of pieces, about a half inch, seaweed on the outside, small-grain rice, no seasoning, no avocado that I could see (but something green in there) and just NO flavor. Everything else was WONDERFUL. Seriously, please visit a sushi bar on the west coast to get the sushi experience. I was so excited to see sushi in my hometown, and then I was just sad! :( I didn't try any other types of sushi, but a Cali roll is basic. If that didn't cut it, I don't know about the rest. Add skills in this department, and this restaurant is 5 stars!!!) (Sorry for hating on the sushi, but seriously, you're going to get out-of-towners. Ya GOTTA get this right!) :)
Were delightfully surprised to find such a first class restaurant in downtown Jamestown.  Service, food, and friendliness were outstanding...  Will definitely be returning again and again!!
We were extremely disappointed by this restaurant. When visiting Jamestown for the night we ate there because of the good reviews. The food was at the very top end of the price range with $30 entrees. I did not see any good $10 specials as one review mentioned. Besides the cost the food was not very good. The sushi was not rolled tightly so fell apart when you tried to eat it with anything but a fork!!
My wife and I LOVE Forte. Great food, but so expensive you can't do it all the time. Sushi is excellent. I usually order one of their specials for my entree. Other than being expensive, the worst thing I can say about the place has gigantic chopsticks that are impossible to wield correctly.
Favorite restaurant in Jamestown.  The owners are doing creative things that you won't find in many restaurants in larger cities.

Coming from the NYC/NJ area I did the only right thing and yelped this place before actually stepping foot inside like any traveler.  Maybe it's a geographical thing, but I have to almost completely disagree with the majority of these 5-star reviews.  Arrived at 7:30 after work with 3 other coworkers only to get told that because we had no reservations (cmon now, Jamestown isn't THAT busy), we had to wait until 8pm for a table for four.  Normally who cares about a wait, especially in a popular and busy place... boy was I in for a surprise.  Not only did we wait 45 minutes for a table, but there were open tables all over the place (two-2 seater tables, two-4 seater, and two-4 seaters put together).  Now it could be very understandable that these tables were under reservation, but one look at the reservation book (btw no host[ess]?) showed only 2 open names which couldn't have accounted for all of the empty tables.  Furthermore, one group came in after us, said audibly they had no reservation, and was seated before us (2 people and a third later).  Skip ahead to the end of the meal and the waitress brought the check over.  Before the check was even out of her hand, my hand was already bringing the credit card out of the wallet - but I guess she couldn't be bothered with her two total tables to wait 5 seconds for me to put the card in.  She left, and we ended up waiting nearly 15 minutes before she actually processed my card (during which, she brought a check to her only other table, went to the register, went back to tell them the card was no good, left again, came back to get their bill, and brought the final copy to sign, after repeated attempts to flag her attention we brought her the check).   Onto the food - Ordered the deviled eggs and calamari for appetizers.  While the eggs were good as any place I've been to, the calamari was the absolute worst I've ever had.  The calamari was cut so thin they were about the width of curly fries, the deep fry job on them seemed like the chef was running low on batter so just made due with what he had, and tasted as if a whole bottle of salt was knocked into the dish by accident.  Entrees consisted of pasta w/ jumbo shrimp which was passable, grilled chicken salad which Heaven help you if you mess that up, and two kobe beef burgers.  Burgers were actually cooked correctly to our order on the inside, but the outsides were pretty much charcoal, someone needs to learn how to cook beef. All in all, IMO this place does not deserve anywhere close to the rating it currently has, granted that could have been an offnight for the restaurant.  I guess their only forte is the bartenders who actually poured a drink with a smile.

Excellent food and even better service!   Great place for a date or after work hangout.
