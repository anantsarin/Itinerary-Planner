Very homey feeling, everyone seemed to have a good time with the owners walking around meeting and greeting. Its the environment and the food. That's what they specialize in. Loved the food and the price. Nothing was super fancy food came in a basket and was full of flavor. Will come back
Food and prices are decent. A bit of elbow grease should shine and clean up the place....it sure does need it.
The Bayside! Nice views and good food. The fish sandwich is delightful and the bay burger is a great deal. Two huge 1/3 pounders with pieces of bacon, this burger is awesome. Curly fries were nice and crispy and their meat hot sauce is scratch made, so good! Cheap prices, lunch for two at thirty bucks after tip and everything and you can't beat that when you're sitting on the water!
Bayside is a Webster waterfront landmark.  The restaurant itself is a 3 rd rate roadside pub, but it's summertime waterfront outdoor dining area, grilled meats and live entertainment make it a very special warm weather destination.  The casual picnic style seating, wonderful waterfront setting and frequent live music make the atmosphere festive yet relaxed.  Most of the grilled dishes , which are done in the visible outdoor kitchen are good, but the strip steaks and ribs are real standouts.  This is a great place to get together with fiends.  They also host private parties/events under a tent.   Don't miss it when the weather is warm!
Great bar food. Best place to go by boat in Rochester for drinks and sandwiches or fried food. Live music on Friday and/or Saturday nights. Cheers!
