I go here for the drinks and the great atmosphere. Sometimes I'll order food from one of the vendors setting up shop there for the evening. I've only eaten delicious things from Belly and let's be honest, who doesn't love homemade doughnuts with their cocktail?!
Simply put, this is one of the worst restaurants I've ever eaten at. We ordered all vegetarian stuff, so it's possible that the meat is more edible. But we had was just plain wrong. We started out with the radicchio leaves with goat cheese, and the leaves were about the size of a large cabbage leaves. This dish was utterly ridiculous. That was the tastiest thing, though, as the bahn mi sandwich was almost inedible. It consisted of pickled carrots, with a thin slice of homemade pickle on top and then some utterly obfuscated concoction under the carrots. Eating this very bready sandwich was akin to chugging vinegar straight up. The tofu was left out of the curry dish, even though it was listed on the menu, and the other food (we got the pate, mushroom, humus combo) was either gross, bland, or desperately over seasoned. At one point in the meal, a large bowl of bland chips arrived: no salt on them and nothing to dip them in. A total waste. I really got the feeling that someone with no clue about food had cooked our meal. In reading a few other reviews, I see that others dig this place. I was sadly unimpressed.
After a horrible experience with the aggressive bouncers at The Dock, was THRILLED to find this wonderful bar with wonderful staff and great music. Would highly recommend to anyone looking to dance a little and have a fun night!
Lot 10 Kitchen and Lounge started strong in February 2012 with the opening of the upstairs bar/lounge with great live acts, DJs, improve comedy, even a story-telling night that was a blast. As of April, the Kitchen part is open... and it's amazing. A small-plates tapas menu by head chef Dan Kiely features sharable items from vegan to steak, sliders and home-made potato chips, and so much more. On the opening night my friends and I ate our fill and still wanted more (so we got the scallops). The waitstaff was 100% on the ball, courtesy and knowledgeable, all on the first night.   In interest of full-disclosure, I'm a personal friend of the chef and even a micro-investor in the restaurant. Call this review biased, but that doesn't make it untrue. I put in money because I've had the good luck to eat Dan's cooking before he even started his personal chef/catering biz a couple of years ago, so I knew the food would be great. The plan the owners have for the space (the former Lost Dog Café in Ithaca) was a no-brainer. I'm extremely happy to say Lot 10 has never disappointed me and I consider it money very well spent and invested.
My friends and I came here after a really bad experience at another bar. We found everyone here to be so friendly. It was an eclectic crowd filled with nice people looking to have fun. Dancing downstairs and drag show upstairs. We paid a cover to go to the drag show and had a blast watching the performers dance and lip sing. The bouncer was so so nice. They made you feel very welcome here. We would go back.
Swing dancing on Wednesday to live music, and the party starts at 6pm. So no late night during a work week! Cash only at the bar upstairs though.
One thing about Lot 10 stands out: homemade Asian pickle juice for your Spicy Asian Pickle Back.  At $3 for a super delicious shot, you can't have just one. The other cocktails were pretty solid, but nothing blew my socks off.  They've got stiff competition because there's a pretty excellent cocktail place just up the hill. The fries were good, with gravy and cheese.   So were the jalapeno poppers that weren't spicy.  There's not much food otherwise, just snacks and appetizers.  Occasionally they have an "in house" food truck serving but we didn't wait around since we were too hungry.
We went for dinner here on a Thursday night during happy hour. The menu looked fun and sounded interesting and the happy hour drink prices weren't too bad. Service was terrific, but oh gad the food. It was terrible. The mushroom pate tasted like dirt--e chef made a poor choice of mushrooms for the spread. The bahn mi was indelible given the amount of vinegar used to pickle the vegetarian ingrediants. The coconuT curry came without any tofu despite what the menu promised and it was painfully spicy and lacked a real depth of flavor. The radicchio cups were enormous -- the leaf, that is-- compared to the tiny amount of filling. Happy hour sangria = minimal alcohol. As for the whole "small plates" thing . . . Well the plates were huge and the servings were minuscule. The best part of the night involved trying to fit the food plates on the table. I left feeling hungry and robbed considering the high price we paid for the "meal" Maybe it's a great club. . . .  But don't go there for dinner.
We had the pleasure of visiting Lot 10 during the Ithaca Festival last week.  Located along S. Cayuga St., the restaurant was somewhat hidden by the festival tents that lined the street, but this is nevertheless an excellent downtown location for this outstanding new find, and well worth a visit.  Lot 10's inspired menu (we particularly enjoyed the small plates) and unique cocktails selection created by a superb master mixologist (I was asked not to reveal his name!) make this place a most welcome addition to Ithaca's nightlife.  I hope that Lot 10 enjoys many years of success.  We will definitely be back!
This review is about the "new" Lot 10.  The Lot 10 who threw in the culinary towel for something along the more libat-ious side. Set your sights on Roland, the 6' 6" bartender.  He is the medicine man.  Have an ailment?  Just tell Roland.  He seems to make it all better.  My most recent prescription included a chamomile tea hot toddy.  I felt better straight away. The guys and gals at Lot 10 have done a great job at transforming this joint into a seen and be seen, but don't be pretentious doing it, type of place. There is a "pop up" guest kitchen/restaurant (Belly, right now).  While they're too meaty for my taste, I can't say anything bad about Lot 10, the bar.  They do it right.
Food was great, staff was wonderful and atmosphere is good for a date or a place to go with friends

Wow. We have always loved the lounge space, and were surprised at how much we like their "pickle back" (a shot of Jameson followed by a shot of pickle juice. Really.) But tonight is the first time we ate in the dining room since it was under different ownership. This is a levels above. Every bite was lovely. The chef obviously has a well developed palate and knows how to build subtle, complex flavors. We had 5 plates and each was better than the last. The adults in our party were impressed by the depth of flavor, and the 11 year old boy in our party asked if there was a polite way for him to lick his plate. The waitress suggested an extra side of crostini to enjoy the residual broth, which I believe is the adult equivalent. Kudos you guys. You do Ithaca proud.

Best cocktail bar in Ithaca, hands down. The bartender, Roland, knows his craft. Can seemingly make any cocktail from memory, with perfect execution.

My first trip to Ithaca and Lot 10 Restaurant and Lounge will certainly not be my last.  I found the restaurant to be clean, aethetically appealing, with a very active environment.  Included were outdoor seating,  downstairs indoor bar, tapas dining, and finally the upstairs entertainment which provided something for every age and range of personalities.  The quality of the tapas was first rate.  Our service was prompt, efficient, and provided for a confident dining experience.
