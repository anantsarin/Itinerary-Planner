Came here after the dude at Main St Bistro was so rude I walked out before eating. Food was good, coffee was good, but the service was excellent--friendly and sincere.

I agree with all of the negative reviews, and some of the more positive ones.  For the price of the cakes, pastries, and other baked goods, one would expect something other than cardboard.  Unfortunately, we have no other bakery in the entire town; hence, the need for those of us who live here in the summer and weekends to go to Stop and Shop for better baked goods - really.  The sandwiches are good, but the wait and the staff make going there a hassle.  It is so small that one has to constantly move further down the aisle.  That has never bothered me if the food is amazing, but it is not. The good things are the sandwiches (if you have lots of time) and the outdoor seating.  I LOVE Bistro, and would wait for hours there before spending any money on The Bakery, unfortunately.

It's a bummer, this place could be so great.  The people are nice. There are some bakeries where everything just tastes like cardboard.  Croissants are basically dinner rolls and the coffee is weak, the cappuccino is basically just cafe con leche - no proper foam.  Hot cross roll is a dinner roll with frosting on it. halfway through your food you realize the person who made this has not traveled. And you want so badly for the people who work there to taste the REAL THING and go "OHHHHHhhhhhhhh THIS is a croissant." And "This is a cup of coffee." Since we've made such strides in these areas over the last 30 years in America.   But alas...

Update below: An excellent and diverse menu  for breakfast lunch dinner and snacks all including wonderful baked goods. What do you like; a rich cookie or some real hefty delicious  bread or bagel (The best bagel a New Paltz) a great cup of coffee or tea or wonderful assorted salads? This is the place. It could be very busy at times and the staff are friendly and happy to meet your every need. Be patient. It's worth the wait. Your tummy will smile all the way home. It has both outdoor seating and indoor upstairs seating. One of my favorite places in the hood.

Their whole wheat everything bagels are my favorite, especially with veggie or scallion cream cheese. Was never impressed with the breakfast sandwiches. Comfortable upstairs dining area; their walls display the work of local artists. Outdoor eating area as well. Awesome rainbow cookies. Mac n' cheese cups too!

Oh the bakery. I miss this place! Such a cute addition to New Paltz. It's a great place for when you wanna do homework outside and get off campus. There's not too much seating and not too big of a place, but it's adorable. They have great pastries... I love their simple butter/shortbread cookies and their coconut macaroons. YUM. Also, I ordered a cake for a friend (when I was abroad in Ireland.... yes across the ocean.) And the woman who helped me was so wonderful. She knew I was on a time limit and ordered the cake and my friend picked it up with no problem. My whole surprise birthday cake from abroad worked out perfectly and all with the help of The Bakery staff.

I'm amazed that this place has so many reviews. I'm not amazed by the ones that are poor. I'm giving 3 stars b/c it seems to be a local mom and pop shop and the food looked good. Still, I'll go into the details. I was on a hike, yoga, wine adventure ... I love to hike, I love to have wine, I do NOT love yoga. In fact, I detest yoga. I prefer my trainers to be fit not prepubescent looking women who chirp and giggle. So my fellow hikers went to do yoga and I was thrilled to check out New Paltz by myself. First it's the size of a stamp. I was impressed by the variety of restaurant choices; Thai, Sushi, and Indian were amongst even more choices. There were two great thrift shops and several antique places. Fun! I stopped in the bakery. Ouch. There were four people ahead of me and four workers. Each worker took an order from each person (this is what happens when you leave the boroughs - it takes one person for each order), no muli-tasking! Three people ahead of me getting wraps, 3 different staff making the sandwiches. The woman ahead of me asked for a cake with Happy Birthday, the worker explained that she needed to use another color because the tube broke. The tube broke because she was holding it like an excited monkey holds a banana. I wished the woman good luck. The worker then proceeded to touch the cake repeatedly with her bare hands. You can trust it was gross if the local New Paltz patron had to address it which she did. Still, it's a local business and the food looked genuinely good. If I ever lived in the middle of nowhere and this was an option, I'd go back with patience as a virtue.

Came here at 11am on a Saturday and thought this place would be rockin' since the line was out the door... um, false. First of all, they were running out of pretty much everything... eggs, bread rolls, croissants..  I guess I can understand running out of eggs, but bread rolls and croissants? What? Hello?.. Isn't this a bakery? Our group managed to get the last of the eggs.  But I'm not even sure that's a good thing since they were cooked in a tupperware container in the microwave.   I ended up getting a ham egg and cheese on ciabatta bread.  Pretty sure my "eggs" were a little green in the middle.   And there was only one slice of ham.   There's seating upstairs, but it's nothing to rave about.  The staff there seemed friendly, but frantic.   One saving grace: The apple cider donuts were probably the best I've ever had.

I hadn't been here in awhile, but stopped in the other day. The coffee is still decent and moderately priced, and the desserts still look delicious. I was upset, however, that they seem to have changed their macaroon recipes. The old ones were deliciously chewy blobs of shredded coconut- now they're more like a cookie that has some coconut in it.  They lose a star from me because of that. The sandwiches and soups have always been reliable though, and the deli window always has a great selection. I'm a huge fan of the black bean chili. When the weather's warm, this is a great place to sit outside with a few good friends. They also have a small play area for children, which I'm sure parents appreciate.

I heard a lot of good things about The Bakery from people in New Paltz.  So I had to give it a shot!   Their bagels are good.  But I don't understand why they don't have my favorite blueberry bagels.  They certainly put a lot of cream cheese if you order on your bagel.   Their pastries are just okay...nothing special.   I think they can improve the way they take orders and give your food.  They do not have a menu hung up on the wall and there is usually a long line.  So if you are not a regular, you don't really know what to order because you can't see anything.  An employee takes your order and the same person prepares your food and do the register too, which I think is very inefficient.   I would go back for a quick breakfast or lunch.
A good friend turned me on to this place a few years ago while we were in college. The staff is courteous and the food is consistently good. The outdoor seating is always nice, and it adds to the relaxed atmosphere of the Bakery. Coming here with a good book on a lazy Sunday afternoon is the ideal scenario. I usually go for the black bean chili with an olive ciabatta. In the cooler months I add one of their large hot chocolates. The cold corn soup they started offering this summer is insane! I'm really surprised about some of the reviews this place has been getting. I've been coming here for a couple of years now, and I've never been disappointed about the important stuff. The only real problems are that they close relatively early (about 7PM), and sometimes they run out of food way before closing time. But that's just because everything is so freaking fresh! You can't make tons of everything and expect to turn a profit when you throw out piles of food everyday.

This is my go-to place for sandwiches and wraps before any adventure in the New Paltz area. I've always found it a bit strange being named The Bakery. When I first was told about it it was like a who's on first skit... You have to try The Bakery. OK whats its name? The Bakery. Yes, the bakery. The Bakery. Huh? Where is it? In town, just ask anyone, they all know the bakery... But more importantly, I've never found the selection of baked goods to be all that great. The quality of what they do offer is pretty good, and probably the best offered anywhere in town, but not great. What is great, and largely why I go, are the sandwiches and salads. They offer several excellent veggie options that can be made as sandwiches or wraps to eat "in" in their outdoor seating or to go on your adventures in the surrounding mountains.

I haven't tried the items everyone else reviewed but I can see how the icings would be excessive.  There are definitely a few items that looked too overdone to taste good but there are two things that they excel at --- black and white cookies and rainbow cookies.   The black and white cookies are the best I've found in the Hudson Valley.  I'm certainly open to suggestions though!  They're the perfect balance of cookie-cake and fondant.   Yum. The rainbow cookies are simply spectacular.  They have a delicious almond taste and are just like my noni used to make.  They're giving me a Pavlov's dog response just thinking about them...drool. Although everything might not be spectacular, don't rule out The Bakery just because of a few bad reviews or items.  It's definitely worth a try...if you can manage to get a parking spot!

I used to eat at the Bakery a lot when I was in college at New Paltz. My go-to was always the chicken sandwich. I still try to eat a meal there every time I'm visiting friends in the area. The lines don't seem to be as long as they used to be, out the door all the time. And I've never had a hard time with the staff. They are very friendly, and will make your sandwich any way you like it. You have your choice of whatever fresh bread or roll they have available. No additional charge for things like lettuce, cheese, tomato, sprouts, or guacamole. (Their guacamole is phenomenal by the way.) This past weekend I tried their housemade quinoa and black bean salad. It had a great taste, and there was a generous helping served into my small order. My friends ordered the fruit salad, and the potato salad (which was especially delicious made with vinegar base instead of mayonnaise). They have an adorable, quiet outside eating area, and it's a great relaxing meal. While their food really doesn't compare to the Main Street Bistro a few doors down, you are guaranteed to not have to wait as long for a table, and there are always great, fresh options.

I haven't been to the bakery in a few years because I felt that the prices were too high,and the quality was not, and I was repeatedly disappointed by the stale cakes. I returned recently for lunch and again was disappointed. The chicken was very dry and the side salad tiny. My husband had a tiny piece of quiche with a side salad. I don't understand the appeal of this cafe,except maybe for coffee and so so pastries.

I really wanted to like this place! My visit started off well, too - nice-looking shop, good range, good service, promisingly busy - but things went downhill very fast once once I actually ate what I bought. The black and white would have been good except it was so overbaked the edges were crunchy. So wrong. And the brownie...this was the first time in my life I've ever thrown out a brownie half-eaten. Dry, cakey, weird aftertaste, and the only chocolate involved in making it seemed to have been a very scant amount of cocoa. Sad.

I remember when the Bakery was in its old building which could only fit 5 customers and the line would be out the door and half-way to the sidewalk before holidays. I will always have some favorites here that will hold a dear place in my heart - Finger cookies, hand cookies, those lacy chocolate sandwich cookies, and croissants. However, I am sad to say that I find that The Bakery's quality has gone downhill. Skip the inauthentic knishes and the bagels that don't deserve to be bagels. Stick to cookies, the challah, and the awesome apple cake. A great place to hang out when it's nice enough to sit outside. EDITED to add: Sadly the prices have gotten so high and the coffee quality so poor that I have had to reduce my rating.
Memo to the Bakery: Please clean your rugs.  It' getting kinda stinky upstairs. I just don't understand how a place that's been a landmark in New Paltz and obviously turns a profit could not think about giving its interior dining area a facelift. Not only are the rugs stinky and smelly, but the paint is peeling in numerous places.  Yeck!  How can New Paltzers stand this. The draw here is certainly not the cakes, which are at best, middling.

I want to love this place. Food great. Location great. But the coffee is TERRIBLE, which is inexcusable in this day and place.  Also, the place always smells of burnt toast and so do its patrons.

Tried out some peanut butter brownies--way too sweet and had a giant layer of frosting (about 1/3 of height) that made my teeth ache. The chocolate croissant was ok, but overpriced.  It was not crisp and the filling was grainy. The bread here is excellent, and pretty much the only reason I still come.  I like the challah the best, but it seems like they rarely have it anymore.. On the last 5 visits, I'd say they had it twice.  This time, there wasn't even a label for the empty shelf.  I got country white instead. Because of the plethora of bakeries in New Paltz and the surrounding area, I'll probably be replacing the Bakery with another.

Broccoli and cheese soup was tasty, as was the carrot and ginger. The location is cute and the staff is friendly

I'll say this up front: I'm not a coffee drinker. Yup, I'm one of the degenerates out there who doesn't touch the stuff. That said, I've always liked going here. The menu changed recently to include deli sandwiches which are really good. Also, get one on a bagel instead of a hard roll. Breakfast sands are pretty good too. Line tends to move slowly, sometimes you can get there when it's short. Carrot cake is good, NOT too sweet & the peanut butter cookies have always been one of my pers favrs. Stop here for lunch while you wander thru NP.

I've been going to the Bakery for about 10 years,  ever since I was a student at SUNY New Paltz.  It's a quaint little place that has it's highs and not-so-highs, most of which are a byproduct of being a business in a small town.  But it does the job and there are a few things that they do well The Pros- a) Coffee is rather delicious, including a daily flavored option tickles my palate - like pumpkin, creme brule, etc b) Frequent organic house made savory options, including vegetarian noodles, vegan options, spinach and feta cheese croissants (which I love love love), knishes, stuffed pretzels, etc c) Daily made bread, scones, muffins, bagels with homemade cream cheeses with a variety of options (including a bacon chipotle which is pretty damn good) d) The baked goods actually made on the premises are pretty decent, including the coconut raspberry bars and their almond cookies. Some are a little heavy (peanut butter brownies) but overall not winning any awards. It's a good tasty treat if that's what you are looking for.   e) Friendly staff - everyone in this place is helpful and always in a positive mood, which helps diffuse a lot of the rush rush rush mentality of some of the out-of-towners The Cons- A) Again, this is a small town with an early rising crowd so sauntering in at 1pm on a full foliage weekend will find most of the stash wiped out as some reviewers have griped about. b) In good weather during busy times, you could wait as long as 20 minutes for a cup of coffee. I wish they'd have a 'coffee only' line so you don't have to wait for the few families of four in front of you to order individual specific items that need to be prepared.   c) The seating upstairs is a little cramped, not cleaned thoroughly (my table is frequently riddled with crumbs) and a bit loud. Overall, I prefer this place over most of the other options in NP, especially on a Main Street where the only alternative for a quick cup of coffee and bite to eat is Starbucks.  What's preventing a higher rating is the cramped ordering line and the lack of better management of the line during busy times.

My girl friend recently had a black and white (cookie) from The Bakery, New Paltz, New York. The dough was absolutely flat, with no taste.  The icing was really too sweet.  My girl friend is originally from Long Island and has been eating high quality black and white's from bakeries located on Long Island for years!  My girl friend knows what a good black and white tastes like.  And, according to her, the black and white at The Bakery was absolute garbage!

I've been a somewhat regular customer at The Bakery for several years, and for the most part, I like it.  I have to admit, I've had a few annoyances while obtaining food there, but I was mostly annoyed by other customers.  For the most part, the staff is courteous and quick to take your order.  The sandwiches are pretty good, the quiche, soups & salads are even better.  It is a convenient stop when I'm driving through New Paltz to get to Kingston and I need something for breakfast or lunch... a whole wheat sesame bagel with olive cream cheese & an iced tea are my usual staples here.  Their cappuccino smoothies beat out Starbucks' frappuccinos most days, depending on who makes you one.  One neat thing The Bakery does from time to time is feature treats and recipes from "back in the day".  All in all, The Bakery is a local business that I'm sure I'll be happy to support for years to come.

Overall, I prefer this place over most of the other options in NP, especially on a Main Street where the only alternative for a quick cup of coffee and bite to eat is Starbucks.  What's preventing a higher rating is the cramped ordering line and the lack of better management of the line during busy times.
My girl friend recently had a black and white (cookie) from The Bakery, New Paltz, New York. The dough was absolutely flat, with no taste.  The icing was really too sweet.  My girl friend is originally from Long Island and has been eating high quality black and white's from bakeries located on Long Island for years!  My girl friend knows what a good black and white tastes like.  And, according to her, the black and white at The Bakery was absolute garbage!
I've been a somewhat regular customer at The Bakery for several years, and for the most part, I like it.  I have to admit, I've had a few annoyances while obtaining food there, but I was mostly annoyed by other customers.  For the most part, the staff is courteous and quick to take your order.  The sandwiches are pretty good, the quiche, soups & salads are even better.  It is a convenient stop when I'm driving through New Paltz to get to Kingston and I need something for breakfast or lunch... a whole wheat sesame bagel with olive cream cheese & an iced tea are my usual staples here.  Their cappuccino smoothies beat out Starbucks' frappuccinos most days, depending on who makes you one.  One neat thing The Bakery does from time to time is feature treats and recipes from "back in the day".  All in all, The Bakery is a local business that I'm sure I'll be happy to support for years to come.
