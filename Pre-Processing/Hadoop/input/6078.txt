Freshest sushi in Palm Bay. Also great and friendly service. Nice and quaint little place.
Very average sushi. The fish was not overly fresh and the crab on my volcano roll was not good crab. It appeared to be canned and the sauce was gross. The edamame we ordered was cold and very old. It was light green in color with brown ends and very mushy on the inside. I was on vacation and wanted sushi. It was ok.
I paid for one of there more expensive sushi platters and it was the worst I ever had if this was my first time tasting sushi I would have written off the idea of ever eating sushi again. Food aside the staff was friendly.
Good food, friendly service, I've taken the family tried mist of the dishes, all were fresh and very good. Posted picture of the    Red Dragon Roll, Reg Dragon Roll, Bohemian Roll, Spicy Seafood Udon, Sushi Combo.
Very quiet and nice place. Can grab some Japanese or Korean food. Service is always quick and sweet!
This sushi is delicious and always has a fresh taste to it! I've gone many times and each time the food was always great!  Oh, and they have some of the best teriyaki beef I've had in a long time.
Good alternative to the other sushi places in Melbourne
Even though I've moved to the other side of Palm Bay and Sushi Mori isn't on the way home anymore, it's still one of my favorite places, 2 years after my initial review. Dining in the restaurant has been a pleasant experience.
