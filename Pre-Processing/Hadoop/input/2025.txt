Diner ? Drive in? or Dive Dive!    But what an assortment of absolutely delicious meals that would put tears in a Korean or anyone else I ordered Monk Fish seafood casserole Did they deliver.   It came in a sizzle pot boiling steady.  Inside was pure flavor.  Huge chunks of Monk fish simmered in a smokey seafood stock.   Kim Chi floating around bean sprouts for an added kick Like an explosion in your mouth a real taste exciter Accompanying this is steamed sticky rice Kim chi pickled onion slices pickled tofu and bean sprouts vinegared in rice wine The food here is the real deal Atmosphere Who cares! The food nothing better

The owner of this establishment definitely deserves 1 star. I would give less if yelp would allow me. Huge attitude issues and rude responses. Don't recommend. If anything order by phone and pick up. You'll lose your appetite by talking to her She was so bad that i made this yelp account. Went through all the yelp confirmation bull shit in order to bash on this shitty disgrace of a Korean establishment

Awesome home-style cooked food. Bought 3 different entrees (2 to take home) and liked all of them. Really sweet lady at the register.

I lived across the street from this place for years and had no idea it was really a Korean place. I thought it was just another hole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurant. The decor screams "American Chinese" restaurant, but order the right Korean item and you'll be pleased, well fed and doing a little dance because of how little $ it cost you. Following fellow yelper Alex K's lead, I ordered the bibimbap which qualified for a lunch special at 3pm on a Saturday -- running me under $7. I was served a large bowl with a fried egg on top along with some sliced beef served over veggies (and comes with a delicious spicy sauce you're supposed to pour over top and mix with rice). The meal was delicious -- could have used a bit more beef, but for $7 I can't really complain. My friend had the bulgoki -- marinated shortribs basically. Well flavored and delicious...and once again -- like $8. To top it off, there's complimentary barley tea and a whole slew of sides that you're served. Kimchi, fishcake...it's all here, as you would expect from a Korean restaurant. The booths are comfy, despite being a little rundown. We stayed for hours and were really comfortable. Too bad I didn't know bout what a gem this truly is when I lived next door!

Should you drive north on Niagara Falls Boulevard past Maple, past the 90 overpass, you will drive right by Seoul Garden without batting an eye.  Tetris-ed into yet another strip mall, it will look like your standard Chinese restaurant as you drive up, as you walk in, even as you look at the first page of the menu. As of January 2013, Japanese and Thai cuisines are fairly well understood in this area.  Consciousness of Middle Eastern and Ethiopian is rising.  Korean is nowhere on the radar yet, so this place serves Chinese food, too.  Korean is nowhere on the radar, but Seoul Garden could help change that. Viewing the interior, you could be forgiven for thinking of Seoul Garden as no-frills.  After all, the decor is comfortable but sparse, and waiter service won't be found.  The reality is surprisingly different.  Home-brewed barley tea is available gratis.  Every meal is served with the complete collection of Korean small side dishes: kimchi, cucumbers, noodles, broth, and so forth.  For the price you pay, you will feast.  Even a table for two will be crowded with delicious things to try. On my visit, I ordered a basic bibimbap.  It was exactly what I used to order in Seoul, Tokyo, and New York: well-seasoned, thinly sliced beef served over a wide assortment of veggies.  I received my spicy sauce.  My mouth was happy.  (Note: only cold bibimbap are served.  If you're looking for a clay pot or ishiyaki bibimbap, you're out of luck here.)  My companion also ordered the Yook Gae Jang, a spicy kimchi-flavored beef and vegetable soup which I was taken with... although she wasn't.   Somehow, I finished my portion.  Somehow, I staggered into the car and drove home.  And I napped. And did I mention I spent less than $7.00 on my meal?
The atmosphere was a little dull but that didn't break my excitement for some Korean food. I was greeted when I entered the door and I grabbed the menu to see what this place had to offer. To my surprise they had Chinese AND Korean. The lady at the front was very nice and there was one other person in the back cooking. I ordered bibimbap, kimchi jiggae, and sesame chicken lunch deal. It was very cheap and to my surprise, it came with sides of kimchi, fish tofu of some sort, and Korean pickled cucumbers. The food was very delicious and we'll prepared. Sesame chicken had a very nice sauce on it and the sauce was new to me because this sauce was more sweeter and very tangy. The wait for the food was 15-20 minutes but there were only two people working the whole store so there can be some leniency there. My first experience at the Seoul Restaurant was great and I hope to come back again. Great Korean food, great people.

My all-time favorite Korean diner in town. Very affordable but authentic and delectable dishes. Sides dishes are always killers. If you were searching Korean restaurants around this area, this has got to be your destination. Soondubu (Tofu Stew w/ rice on the side) is my favorite dish from them.   The old couple that work at the place are very lovely and nice. Oh, and did I mention that they have lunch specials til 3pm?? One other interesting fact about Seoul Garden is that they also serve Chinese food. However, I had never tried it because there Korean dishes alone can dominate my taste buds.

This place has great food and great prices.  No atmosphere, but I guess that doesn't matter in a run-down plaza on NF blvd.  This one of our new stand by take out places.

Seoul Garden is your no-nonsense Korean and Chinese restaurant. The owner couple are no frills professionals. If you don't need anything but good food, this is the place. Just put things into perspective. This is Buffalo. If you want fancy, go to Toronto. Don't judge a book by it's cover. The five stars are for overall value. Your bill will be about 60% of the other Korean restaurants on the east side of Niagara Falls Blvd. You can take this review to the bank!

I am a sucker for these Ma and Pa hole in the wall places, and this place hits my soft spot! As another reviewer suggested, the restaurant could use some updating on furnishings. The booths are due for reupholstering/replacing. However, I must vehemently disagree with the comments about small portions and rude service. I find their portions to be large and the service to be good. I'm no Korean food expert, but I thoroughly enjoyed my dishes. They serve it with all the accoutrements, including various types of kimchi and fish cakes.  Great hole in the wall place with inexpensive, delicious, and seemingly authentic Korean food. I will be going back.

I come here rather often and I have to say this place is amazing. They have Korean food but also a Chinese food menu for those afraid to try something new.  My favorite Korean dish there is Jae Yook  Bokum ! Great Kim Chi too. There are also very friendly and great prices

My friend recommended this place as authentic Korean place.  I have been this place twice so far.  The food and the price is great, especially lunch.  Only thing is people who run this place were not friendly.They were only friendly after I gave a decent tip.

I decided to have dinner at this place after reading the reviews. I ordered the Korean dumpling soup. This is truly a mom and pop place, the food was really good  with lots of condiment to add to the soup. Also as stated in the previous reviews they don't accept tips even when I insisted.. Will come back to try other items on their menu.

Only had Korean dishes from the menu, it's very good for the price I paid. Even though they are fast food take out restaurant from the looks. The quality of the food is a little beyond expectation. They also have very cheap Chinese lunch specials, good for your pocket money.
