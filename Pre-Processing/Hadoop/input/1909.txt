Good divey bar. Nothing fancy. Good quick service as a bar should  be. Limited menu. Mostly regulars but welcome outsiders.

Expensive mediocre bar food.  I ordered the wings wet and they came out over cooked and with no sauce.  The Blue Cheese had zero taste.  The area is very seedy with lots of transients about.  Every burger was $10.95 or $11.95.  Not bad for game visibility but they blast music so you won't get any game sound.  That alone disqualifies the place from being considered a sports bar.  Moved over to Union Square a couple blocks away and thought that experience was better.  Higher ceilings, more modern, everything on menu a few dollars cheaper,  and you could actually get sound on a football game.

I still work right up the road from "The Nuddy" and my girlfriend and I like going there every couple of weeks to unwind from the daily grind and escape from work if only for an hour! The menu was updated this past year and has a lot of new items, inspired by gourmet recipes that are contemporary and appealing.  I do miss a couple of items from the former menu, but the new menu does have a lot of refreshing new items available and they are very tasty.   Each time that we've been there for lunch during the work week, there has been virtually no one else in there, though.  So, I wasn't surprised when I recently stopped in and was told by a young man that the establishment was not going to be serving lunch any longer due to lack of business.   He also stated that he believed they would be serving lunch on Fridays, though, but I stopped by there just this past Friday, 8/24, and they were closed again.   Too bad.   One of the lunch time waitresses was a tad short on personality - aloof, but a good server, so we liked her anyway.  She was also bar tending at the same time, and makes a mean Mai Tai and other mixed drinks!! My friend and I will miss The Nuddy for lunch, sadly.

Great drinks! The new chef is great! The food is better than it has been in years. Had the coffee rubbed steak special. Wow, knock your socks off good. And the food prices are really inexpensive. The beers on tap keep changing, so there is usually something new to try.

Wow. I must say, very good food and excellent service. I was pleasantly surprised. The are chefs are serious about putting out a good looking and tasting product. You can tell they were serious about their food which was great to see. I love hip hop and R&B and we came here on a Wednesday night to pep the Saber's game with my boy.  It turned out to be metal night. WTH? But, Patty the bartender was awesome and straight beautiful and it actually turned out to be some talented Kat's out there. The only reason they don't get 4 stars is because again, I love Wayne, Joe Budden, Drake and Trey Songz.

Situated on a corner in main street I found this bar to have a plethora of interesting, fun, and lively people. The music was rocking and the smiles were strewn seamlessly throughout the crowd. Now being connected to the concert venue/bar "The Chance" this place is a must visit for before and after a show. Great times, great food, good beer. The bartender named Nick was a real stand up guy. This place has become one of the reasons why I will see more shows up in Poughkeepsie. Yay!

Well this could be a decent bar but it is always empty, and therefore anybody who enters the place languishes inside the establishment with a few servers staring you down hoping for perhaps a tidbit of something to do during their shift.  I've been on a few nights during the week and it never has more than 2-3 people in it when I walk in.  Their liquor selection is lacking to say the least, they keep some of the basics there like vodka and rum but if you ordered say a long island iced tea they don't hold the inventory to make it.  The food is decent, but they close the kitchen early or never even open it up most nights because no one is in there and its a waste of money to have the grill on I assume.  I went one time on a Monday and the whole place was closed down.  If you like drinking alone, this is the place for you, or perhaps just stay home and drink/order takeout, same thing except you get food.  The gal that works Tuesday nights is a bit rude and is mostly preoccupied with her iphone to serve you on time but otherwise a friendly (and very bored) staff serves you promptly.
