(4.5 Stars) Whenever I visit my best friend in Poughkeepsie, we hit up CRAVE because the food and service are topnotch, and my friend just happens to live right next to it. SCORE!! So, we can hop out of her apartment have a lovely meal and split a bottle of wine and hop back inside her place before I can say "Brrr" in the winter. Can it get any better than that?! IT CAN!! I've visited CRAVE about three times and always enjoyed their food and wine recommendations (the waitstaff is seriously wine-skilled). When my friend and I came on May 22nd, aka the day after the would-be Rapture, the food, wine, and service absolutely WOWED me. I asked for a good pinot grigio or sauvingnon blanc to go with the meal, and our waiter came up with a spot on pick that blended the beauty of each type from Millbrook, NY. He also gave us nearly a glass of the wine just to try. OH YES. We then received a delicate watermelon, feta, and basil oil amuse bouche to whet our palates as well as two pieces of their signature rosemary bread served warm as always with separate dishes of whipped butter for each of us. Why more restaurants do not warm their bread, I don't know? Key fact: the Hudson Valley is known for its duck. Second key fact: Whenever I do not order CRAVE's duck, I kick myself. This time I wised up an ordered the duck and fell in love!! At our fantastic waiter's advice, I ordered the duck medium, and it came out moist and flavorful with a subtle raspberry sauce (good since I'm not one for fruity meat). It came with swiss chard that allowed the greens to sing without being overly aggressive and the richest, butteriest polenta cake. No exaggeration, that duck dish is my best restaurant meal in recent memory. For the record my dining buddy also called her steak "AH-MAZING" many many times of the course of dinner. My best friend loved her dark chocolate torte for dessert. I tried a bite and appreciated its richness and deep flavor, I'm just not as big on that type of dessert (personal preference). Instead, I drank some decaf coffee to finish my delicious dinner and thanked God for not ending the world the day before so that I could partake of this glorious plate of food.
We've been to Crave three times and have always been satisfied.  Their dishes are always inventive & delicious and the ambiance is very NYC.  We stay away from red meat but it's not a problem at all at Crave. I think last time we were there I had a really succulent chicken dish and my wife had the sea bream (I hadn't even heard of that fish before).  Both were great and the accompanying sides were perfect. The other great thing about Crave is that it's right at the foot of the Walkway with some stairs to take you right to the entrance gate.  I'd highly recommend coming here for dinner - I think during the week they have a three course special but we've only been here on weekend nights.
Had one of the best meals here in August. The unique flavors and locally sourced ingredients made for a fun experience. Service was also fantastic. Lovely server who went out of her way to check ingredients with the chef as I have some dietary restrictions. Don't miss Crave if you're in the area (aka skip the Culinary Institute and come here!).
Very interest food flavor combinations and nice atmosphere.
I've been wrestling with the thought of writting a review on Crave since we left last night. To say we were disappointed is an understatement. We have dinner here probably4 or 5 times and up until last night I would have given 5 stars without hesitation. Last night was 2 stars at best. I really wish yelp would allow half stars I really feel 4 stars is to many but 3 would be to few. The appetizers were good as was the chesse plate we shared for dessert and that was about it. I had the duck entree and my wife had the cavatelli both were very uninspired and to be perfectly honest I have had better frozen vegetables out of a Trader Joe bag. The duck was cooked to order but the fat was in no way crispy and it was ordinary at best. My wife's cavatelli were rather salty and again nothing special. The service was decent, wouldn't say good wouldn't say bad but again I have come to expect more from Crave. I also was rather disheartened when they did not serve an amuse-bouche that night. Don't know if it was just a one night thing or if they simple stopped the practice that I truly enjoy in a fine dinning establishment. And the room was also very warm last night which I am sure added to the overall dissatisfaction we felt. Would I go back to Crave, yes without a doubt. As I had mentioned we had dined there before and always had a great meal. Everyone is entitled to a bad night and I certainly hope that's what it was a bad night and not a sign of things to come...
came on a saturday night while visiting my much younger sister in college.  wanted to take her out for a treat, and this was most definitely that. the ambiance and service are high end, but not stuffy or pretentious.  outdoor seating area was adorable and waitstaff allowed us to come inside for a new seat any time if we got cold.  staff was super friendly, accommodating, and modest. the food was 90% perfect.  we received a yummy tasting of beef tartare with horseradish sauce to start, some fresh bread with a rosemary butter, and an appetizer special (forgot the name) but it was basically a melted fresh mozz integrated with ricotta on a tostini type thing dressed with some reductions and fresh arugula, beets, and carrots.  All very good, As for main course, my sis got a roasted chicken which was extremely tasty.  i definitely was sucking on her leftover bones (no shame in my game!).  The accompaniments were pretty rich and creamy which is great if you're into that sort of thing- but if you're not it could be too heavy and just too much. I got the striped bass.  my only problem with the dish was the bass itself, a little too fishy for me and i don't think it was cooked to perfection as i noted a lot of dark spots through out the fish.  still edible though, well seasoned and nicely portioned.  all the sides were the great.  the chorizo puree stuff nearly had me licking my plate. drinks blew me away, lemon-rosemary spritz was so refreshing and not too sweet and the chardonnay with my meal was excellent.  pecan brownie dessert special was decadent and just a great treat. will be back when and if i find myself back in po-town!
We ate here for dinner, had it outside. It was really nice weather, the inside restaurant is very dark, can't really see anything. We were seated outside, and got our menu right away. One of the problem that we had from our experience is the speed of the service. We got our starter  like 30 minutes after we ordered: charcuterie plate... it was alright... the only thing nice about it is the some kind of curry quenelles which is really good with the pickled vegies, and etc. I asked for the bread and butter, and took 15 minutes for it to come to my bnb plate. The entree took 15 minutes after our starter, but as soon as it came, the food is pretty good. I had the special " chicken and waffle. perfectly cooked chicken breast, crispy waffle, and very good sauce. I would love to be back here, I hope they will provide me a better experience
We came from California to celebrate our 3rd anniversary here. The food was amazing, they reserved the VIP table in the window for us, and made special menus that said "Happy Anniversary" on them for us. The atmosphere is awesome, we loved it. Took a stroll on the Walkway Over The Hudson to watch the sunset before dinner.
I was here for Brunch.  The menu is limited for Brunch.  We tried several dishes and they were all good.  A Salmon on a kale salad, steak, bitter greens with potatoes and squash and poached egg with duck and potatoes and squash. All were very good and we would order again.
Exceptionally good meal, excellent service and great ambiance. Turns out it's restaurant week in the Hudson Valley - $29 price fixe. Highly recommend.
This is the first time we have been to crave  it did not disappoint in a small comfortable setting the food was excellent. The service was excellent also 2 people had the chicken and waffles and 2 the halibut both great outstanding taste we will be back
An intimate, romantic dining room with eclectic delicious food that changes seasonally.   We have had dinner here many times and it has been amazing.   The menu has now been changed (October 2014) to include small plates which can serve as an appetizer or two can serve as an entree.  Great idea.   Service is always great and the staff is efficient and friendly.   Love it here.
CRAVE is one of those places that is truly worthy of Yelp's 5 stars. We arrived on a Tuesday evening, checking the place out because we are considering using sister restaurant Lola's as our wedding caterer.  We ended up being the only people in the restaurant for our entire dinner service and had a personal kitchen and server to ourselves. The chef sent a complimentary small taste of a pea soup to start out the meal.  It was really flavorful and tasty - there were notes of garlic and it tasted really nice.  Our bread was next, and again this tasted nice and fresh. I started off with the shrimp wontons and my fiancée had the appetizer-sized risotto special.  The wontons were great - came out piping hot (one of the nice things about having the restaurant to yourself), and the edamame/seaweed garnish paired really well with the shrimp and the slightly spicy dipping sauce.  The risotto was also fantastic.  The veggies tasted nice and fresh.  The rice was definitely done enough... maybe a bit too done, but that's a lot better than getting served a crunchy risotto. I ordered the sea bass for my entrée, and the fiancée ordered the duck.  Both mains were excellent - very nice seasoning on the bass with a nice mix in the garnish sitting below the fish (I think I spotted golden raisins in there).  The fish was nice and moist - the juices just oozed out when I used my fork to cut into it.  The duck just melted in your mouth; very nicely cooked and the seasoning was spot on.  Eddie (chef/owner) came out after we had finished and told us that the duck was his favorite thing on the menu... so if you are in doubt, the duck is probably a great option. We finished with a flourless chocolate cake and a strawberry cannoli.  I really liked the cake, my fiancée who isn't a chocolate maven thought it was fine.  She really enjoyed the cannoli, I was kind of meh on that... so I guess we ordered the right desserts! If you are in the Mid-Hudson Valley and are looking for a fine dining restaurant, this is the place to go, hands down.  We spent around $125 including drinks and tip for a 3-course meal and I felt like it was a great value considering the very high quality of the food and the personalized service.  Granted, we were prospective clients, but still I feel like the experience would have still been great.  If you are looking for an intimate dinner, I'd highly recommend going on Tuesday or Wednesday, when you should have no trouble getting a table, and can enjoy the attentive service!
4.5. Very nice restaurant, good service, delicious food.  Escargot and kale salad were great but highlight was chicken w waffles!  Immediately adjacent to Walkway on the Hudson.  Look forward to coming back.
Went here for mainly apps and drinks so I can't comment much on dinner. BUT what I did have was delicious! The arepa app was very good, and sizable for an app. I really enjoyed sitting out on their patio under the heat lamps and knocking back a few drinks with friends. Very relaxing and chill environment as far as the outside goes!
One of my all time favorite restaurants. I cannot say enough great things about the food, desserts, service, friendly staff, and the owner.   The restaurant is beautiful and always immaculate. Food:  We love the salmon and all of the salads. The desserts are a must. Try them all at least once!!
All the CIA restaurants were packed (graduation) so one of the CIA staff recommended Crave.  Food was excellent, I really enjoyed the special - Arctic Char prepared sous vide.  Our party of 4 also shared severals appetizers, all very good although portions were a little too small to share.  The wait staff service was good, a little inexperienced, but definitely working to please.  I would eat here again.
I'm yelping about this place before I even leave... We dropped in on the way back to NYC and had dinner. This place does delicious, interesting, inspired dishes. It's a little pricey but completely worth it. My gnocchi came out weird - the situation was handled SO well. That's worth 5 stars in my book.
Everything was top notch from reservations and ambience to service and super food. Totally impressed. I wish I could rate 6 stars!! The outdoor lounge area was quite comfortable and romantic-fun. We actually ate dinner sitting in the comfortable lounge chairs which had small tables in front of them. We expected this to be impractical, but it was totally fine.
This is probably my favorite place to dine at for special occasions on the "other" side of the river.  When I went last March it had just opened so it was very hard to get a reservation but I was not disappointed.  The bar area was nicely designed and the dining area, while a little cramped, was elegant.  The menu was mouth watering! I had salmon with green beans over a chili oil with a delicious hominy cake that oozed flavor.  While the salmon was perfectly cooked, I did find two bones in it which was the only reason why this place isn't five stars.  I would definitely like to go back here in the near future!
One of the best restaurants in Poughkeepsie. Frequently tops my list of places to recommend those visiting. The Duck was cooked to perfection; ambiance is very inviting and warm; service was impeccable. I really can't say anything bad about this place. Only give it a 4/5 just because there are other restaurants I'd probably go back to before this one just based off my interests - also a tad Pricier than I'd expect. Other's in the area if looking to shake things up - Artist's Palate; Terrapin; Calico; and my all time favorite - Henry's at the Farm!
A friend of mine from Poughkeepsie wanted to meet here for dinner (I had been here before a few years ago) and I agreed because I remembered the food being good.  The restaurant is small but beautifully decorated and very dimly lit to give it a very romantic feel.  Perfect for date nights but laid back enough to catch up with some friends  The menu is extremely small and nothing really jumped out at me.  I ordered the kale Caesar salad and the ancho chile and coffee rubbed short ribs (and I was not very excited about either).  I was absolutely blown away when the food arrived!  Each course was absolutely delicious.  The Caesar salad salad was perfectly dressed and the short ribs were some of the best I have ever had.  I ordered wine with meal and their wine list was pretty decent.  My friend ordered 2 specialty cocktails off of their menu and she said they were both delicious.  The second one was served in a very cool almost copper looking mug (nice touch).    I only have 2 (minor) complaints.  The first is that the parking situation is not amazing and the second is that I felt the menu was a little too limited.  Neither of these things would prevent me from coming back because overall I had a wonderful experience.
This place is awesome!! The food is delicious and the service is very attentive. I love the fact that they have smaller plates on the menu & that you can order small/large sized entree's as well. Make sure to make a reservation on the weekend because this place is pretty tiny and they fill up quick. I'll definitely be back!
One of my favorite dinner places in the area. Great food and service!
I chose Crave for dinner on my one night in town for work, and I'm so happy that I did. It's a bit removed from the Main St. scene and is housed in a charming old home with a romantic intimate ambience and a bar in the back with a very friendly bartender and a nice diverse wine list as well as drafts -- even moonshine on draft! I chose my staple of a kale salad prepared as a Caesar, and it was the most beautifully presented kale salad I've ever experienced. The kale was heaped in a rounded mound on top of croutons, and the caesar dressing topped the salad and served as a decoration for the plate. The salad is splittable, but it was so good that I had to eat the entire salad. At the recommendation of my server, I chose the rabbit entree. Succulent juicy rabbit was torn into pieces of stringy meat and served over polenta along with carrots and grilled brussell sprouts. I rarely allow myself the luxury of polenta, but I am so glad that I did tonight. The rabbit seasoning mixed with the creamy polenta was nothing short of incredible, and one of my top 2 dishes of 2014 so far. It helps that the Culinary Institute is so close -- and the inspiration was manifest right on my plate. Kudos to the chef and staff for an excellent experience.
Excellent Italian-inspired menu. Fresh ingredients. Good presentation. Great portion sizes. Service top notch and outdoor seating is great. I've been twice now and would recommend.
I liked this place because the service was really nice.  The food was not a complete hit or miss but nothing extraordinary either.  I stopped here for dinner after visiting some vineyards in the Hudson Valley with my boyfriend and another couple.   We read some good reviews so we were excited to try a new place.  For starters we had some apps.  We had the duck scrapple salad which was a duck croquette served with frissee and an egg.  I can't resist anything with an egg.  Although the polenta croquette was tasty it did not taste of duck.   It tasted like maybe pork or beef.  Whatever it was it was tasty but it wasn't exactly what was described in the menu.  My bf ordered the lamb fritters which was a special appetizer for the day.  This should be called fritters with essence of lamb.  Again this plate did not exactly taste like it's name.   So maybe there is a theme here.  For entrees we had the pasta with boar and the salmon gnocchi special.  Both were solid plates although slightly overpriced for pasta even if it is homemade.   I think this place is probably exceptional for the location.  I wouldn't mind having them in my neighborhood.  I would probably try to gracefully tell the chef my comments on some dishes because I support local businesses and I appreciate their effort.  I know my bf would definitely share his comments being that he is a chef and CIA grad like the owner.   All in all the service is very friendly, ambience is great just the execution of the food leaves something to 'crave' for afterwards.
Time after time this place rocks!  The best of the Hudson Valley! Consistently great service paired with great food and drink.  I am always amazed at the innovative combination of favors that they come up with. I have had most of the items on the menu, and have yet to have something that I did not like.
Had yet another outstanding meal at Crave last night with friends to celebrate their 36th wedding anniversary!   We sat outside which was delightful.  They always have seasonal cocktails which we really enjoy.   If you enjoy octopus, which is very difficult to prepare correctly, the team at Crave knows how to do it right.  This dish also seems to change from time to time - on apreviouls occasion i enjoyed it more "stewed" in a red type of sauce and last night, since it is summer, it was in a salad with greens and seasonal veggies.   There is always an enjoyable amuse bouche, which is a very nice touch.  The portions are generous - personally I usually have a salad and appetizer as my main course, but others always enjoy the entrees.  Our friends last night both had the steak which was excelent.   The Chef and his team take the time to make many of the components of the dishes in house which makes an enormous difference in the quality of the meal. Very nice service and atmosphere round out this restaurant for a very enjoyable experience.
Have to say best experience I I've had  in a long time! Food was amazing I had the New Zealand lamb shops medium Rare  OMG delicioso. But from appetizer, salad, main course, to desert.  Was an experience I won't forget. . And to top it off  the service was A++ the chef came after dinner to thank us and socialize. .A+A+
Crave is a great spot to have a few interesting drinks. The menu is eclectic and fun I love trying something new every time I go. Everything on the menu was delicious especially the octopus.
Great flavors! Great service! Personable chef! You can tell there is love in the dishes!
Pleasant surprise.  We usually eat in Rhinebeck but met friends in Poughkeepsie and picked out Crave as a local place.  Food and service were great.  Oysters with a special vignette were fantastic.  Kale salad very interesting.  Gnocchi, a pork scrapple, grilled veggies, etc -- all quite good.  Some craft beers and affordable wines by the glass.  Only regret we didn't get to walk on the bridge over the river.  Next time.
Go for the food and the great location at the foot of Walkway on the Hudson. The small plates are creative and deliver fine dining in manageable portions.   As other reviewers say, expect to tolerate service that does not quite match the menu - a little slow and more casual too match the food.   Tip: eat an hour before sunset and then go right up the walkway to see the spectacular view.
So, this was our second time at Crave. The first time was good, not great; but we went on St. Patrick's Day, so we thought maybe it was an off night, and we thought it definitely warranted a second visit. Turns out that was the wrong choice. My dining partner chose the duck spring roll (a special) appetizer to start; I went with the Asian BBQ Octopus. Both came out extremely quickly, sending us the sign that they were looking to turn the table in a hurry. Not my idea of fine dining, but OK -- let's get to the goods. BOTH appetizers were way too huge, portion-wise -- perhaps not a common complaint, but still. I like to have room left over for the entrée. The duck spring roll was tasty, but served with a massive chunk of bone! Technical error number 1. Ack. The Octopus was flavorless and rubbery; definitely overcooked. Plus, it was served on a mountain-sized slice of grilled pineapple, which completely overwhelmed the flavor profile of the dish. Technical error #2. For entrées, we had the seafood pasta (she) and the pork tenderloin (me). The seafood pasta was the best thing we had all night -- nicely composed, flavorful, and an overall winner. The only complaint? This was a dish that had exactly four mussels in it...and one of them was unopened. You think that there might have been a little more attention paid to what was being served, but that was kinda the motif throughout our meal... Moving on. The tenderloin was nothing short of a disaster. If there was anything resembling seasoning on the meat, it was indiscernible. It was served with "bacon jus," which was again - completely flavorless. Finally, there was a pile of sautéed spinach on the plate that was wilted and -- again -- totally unseasoned. Not even a sprinkle of salt or something to wake it up from its spinachy slumber. I don't know the last time I sent something back in a restaurant, but to send me a $25 plate that was this lousy -- I had to complain. Anyway, I thought the way they handled my returning of the plate was not great either. No questions asked about it -- they whisked it away, struck it from the bill, and asked me if I wanted anything else. I settled on another appetizer (the shrimp and grits, which were terrific) -- but no one bothered to ask me what was wrong, or attempted to make any other amends other than getting us out of there. The waiter's chilliness after returning the plate was clear, and that was less than fun. So, Crave. I am sorry that it hasn't worked out for us. I was really hoping for another fine place in Poughkeepsie we could frequent - but it is clear that is not to be.
Tonight I went to the bar at Crave for a drink with a colleague. I figured we would have a drink, chit chat for a bit, catch up then leave. Well, I was wrong! When I sat down at the bar, I was greeted by the friendly bartender, just as he was saying hello to me, one of the chefs, Catherine, came out of the kitchen. She stopped and turned to me and said: "Are you the one who posted..." I cut her off, "yes, I did". She thanked me, said she saw my post this morning and appreciated it. We spoke for a few minutes about the quality of the pictures that my phone takes (I personally think they're horrible, but she liked them). A few minutes later (as I was sipping my McCallan on the rocks) Ed, the owner came over, shook my hand, greeted me by name and asked how I was doing. We talked for a while about work, life and his upcoming food extravaganza trip to Vegas. The waiter (who's waited on me several times, but whose name I can not remember) came over, shook my hand and politely welcomed me. Just before my friend arrived, a dish was sent out of the kitchen for me. They kindly sent me the baby spinach salad with the pork torchon, whiskey soaked cherries and mustard dressing (this food blogger thing is starting to be really cool). Wow, that was amazing, The salad was peppery and the pork torchon... . Tender pork, breaded and fried. Well, that makes me a happy girl! You see, this is why I love going there. Not only is the food out of this world - but they're so gracious, so lovely and they always make you feel welcome.
It had been too long since I had visited Crave, so four of us decided to go on Friday night.  We made reservations for the patio and as it turns out they had a wine tasting from 4-7 that night. We enjoyed all the wines at the tasting, which were paired with appetizers like duck and steak tartare and the sat and ordered 4 appetizers for the table and one entree all to just nosh on and share, which wasn't a problem at all. We had a watermelon gaspacho, duck confit wontons, shrimp fritters, little neck clams and the carrot risotto. We shared a bottle of Barbera d'Alba and one glass of Sancerre for the white wine drinker in the group. We were given ample amounts of bread, especially to soak up the fabulous tomatoe broth from the clams and we each had a tzatsiki pizza amuse bouche. We shared a coffee cake, which was a hot flourless chocolate cake with chocolate ice cream and whipped cream and a chocolate peanut butter bomb, which was scoop of PB ice cream, dipped in chocolate on a plate drizzled with salted butter caramel. All of the food was fanstastic, the wait staff was friendly, knowledable and really perfect. We had a wonderful night and the outdoor patio setting was really amazing. We will be back. Not as often as I'd like, but hopefully often enough.
Came here with a friend for a weekend getaway and decided to eat here for dinner. He lives in Brooklyn and works in mid-town, and is used to good restaurants and he was very impressed. He thought this restaurant would do very well in nyc and I agree. I eat out alot for work dinners etc and would be happy to take a partner here. The lamb was amazing. The wait staff was friendly but knew when to leave us alone to talk. It was very relaxing especially after the drive up from nyc, and it was a great way to kick off a great weekend. Wine selection was very good. Ambiance is nice and allows you to hear yourself talk. You feel like you have your own little corner of the world.
Being the perpetual grump that I am, some parts of this place annoyed me, but the incredible food here outweighed my crabby desire to take away a star. Fairly tiny place, I hear there's outdoor seating but it was raining so I didn't get to see the whole place. Intimate atmosphere, by that I mean "if you don't want the table beside you reading your texts, don't text". Also while I appreciated the cool hammered-copper tabletop, it was actually a high end looking stick-on surface which was peeling away underneath our table, and the fantastically gummy glue stuck to my skirt. I have yet to get that off. Lighter fluid ought to take care of that (no really). I'm for ditching the coppery tables for something simpler covered in proper white starched linens. As per usual, my margarita is the benchmark for a decent drink and bartender, and this place delivers: limey, you can taste the tequila but it's neither heavy handed nor watered down, nicely done. The alcohol here is particularly stupidly overpriced, they seem to be able to get away with it. I would think that they could drop the price a buck or two on all of the alcohol to entice more diners: the place was half empty on a saturday night, which, for the food quality isn't really fair. I was pleasantly surprised by a complimentary amuse-bouche, a red curry type paste on pita, very very good. Eye-poppingly great bread was served in a bizarre fashion: it seems one bread basket (like an upside down wrapped fez) was shared by all the servers, each of whom got a turn with the fez and tongs, doling out one piece at a time to the slaves, god forbid any of us get more than one piece at any given time. The hot-potato-bread-fez made infrequent rounds throughout the tables, my dinner companion was quite mournful about that. The bread was seriously great. Shared appetizer of mussels, holy mother that broth was good enough to make a grown man cry. Perhaps that's why we spent much of dinner eyeing the bread-fez, next time I'll hide a half a baguette in my purse so I have something to soak up the "omg did you TASTE THIS?!" broth. I had a steak which was good - companion had the duck breast which was tear-inducing. My god that was good duck. The duck was like ordering The Avengers on the hotel TV and accidentally getting porn for free and THEN your spouse gets hot and bothered AND you get lucky all on one plate. The duck was GREAT. All accompanying vegetables were done more than perfectly - I don't write home about perfect vegetables usually. Crisp, fresh, juicy, I mean, who REALLY digs into their veggies and says "wow you gotta try the vegetables!"? Crave makes you do this, and my carnivorous companion thoroughly agreed, the vegetables were "oh, hey, these are good" which means they were covered in unicorn tears. Not big on desserts so a coffee finished things off. The wine list overall is sort of wonky to me, some wines which I know to be $8 a bottle are $6.50 a glass (normal stupid markup) others which I know are $9/bottle are $11/glass which makes no sense. I probably shouldn't say this because then they'll mark it up. The markup on wine here doesn't seem to make any sense at all. Also the grits thing on the menu was weird TO ME. Not to everyone, I guess. The food is outstanding from front to back. The service was good. Considering the prices it was reasonably friendly but for such a small place the waitstaff really needs to be more watchful, especially if they have one bread-fez to share amongst all of them. Will we go again for the very very good food, you betcha. If you have $125 or so +tip to spend on dinner without blinking, you absolutely have to visit at least once. Did I mention the duck?
Great spot at the bottom of the staircase leading to the Walkway Over The Hudson. Brunch or dinner!
(4.5 Stars) Whenever I visit my best friend in Poughkeepsie, we hit up CRAVE because the food and service are topnotch, and my friend just happens to live right next to it. SCORE!! So, we can hop out of her apartment have a lovely meal and split a bottle of wine and hop back inside her place before I can say "Brrr" in the winter. Can it get any better than that?! IT CAN!! I've visited CRAVE about three times and always enjoyed their food and wine recommendations (the waitstaff is seriously wine-skilled). When my friend and I came on May 22nd, aka the day after the would-be Rapture, the food, wine, and service absolutely WOWED me. I asked for a good pinot grigio or sauvingnon blanc to go with the meal, and our waiter came up with a spot on pick that blended the beauty of each type from Millbrook, NY. He also gave us nearly a glass of the wine just to try. OH YES. We then received a delicate watermelon, feta, and basil oil amuse bouche to whet our palates as well as two pieces of their signature rosemary bread served warm as always with separate dishes of whipped butter for each of us. Why more restaurants do not warm their bread, I don't know? Key fact: the Hudson Valley is known for its duck. Second key fact: Whenever I do not order CRAVE's duck, I kick myself. This time I wised up an ordered the duck and fell in love!! At our fantastic waiter's advice, I ordered the duck medium, and it came out moist and flavorful with a subtle raspberry sauce (good since I'm not one for fruity meat). It came with swiss chard that allowed the greens to sing without being overly aggressive and the richest, butteriest polenta cake. No exaggeration, that duck dish is my best restaurant meal in recent memory. For the record my dining buddy also called her steak "AH-MAZING" many many times of the course of dinner. My best friend loved her dark chocolate torte for dessert. I tried a bite and appreciated its richness and deep flavor, I'm just not as big on that type of dessert (personal preference). Instead, I drank some decaf coffee to finish my delicious dinner and thanked God for not ending the world the day before so that I could partake of this glorious plate of food.
We've been to Crave three times and have always been satisfied.  Their dishes are always inventive & delicious and the ambiance is very NYC.  We stay away from red meat but it's not a problem at all at Crave. I think last time we were there I had a really succulent chicken dish and my wife had the sea bream (I hadn't even heard of that fish before).  Both were great and the accompanying sides were perfect. The other great thing about Crave is that it's right at the foot of the Walkway with some stairs to take you right to the entrance gate.  I'd highly recommend coming here for dinner - I think during the week they have a three course special but we've only been here on weekend nights.
Very interest food flavor combinations and nice atmosphere.
came on a saturday night while visiting my much younger sister in college.  wanted to take her out for a treat, and this was most definitely that. the ambiance and service are high end, but not stuffy or pretentious.  outdoor seating area was adorable and waitstaff allowed us to come inside for a new seat any time if we got cold.  staff was super friendly, accommodating, and modest. the food was 90% perfect.  we received a yummy tasting of beef tartare with horseradish sauce to start, some fresh bread with a rosemary butter, and an appetizer special (forgot the name) but it was basically a melted fresh mozz integrated with ricotta on a tostini type thing dressed with some reductions and fresh arugula, beets, and carrots.  All very good, As for main course, my sis got a roasted chicken which was extremely tasty.  i definitely was sucking on her leftover bones (no shame in my game!).  The accompaniments were pretty rich and creamy which is great if you're into that sort of thing- but if you're not it could be too heavy and just too much. I got the striped bass.  my only problem with the dish was the bass itself, a little too fishy for me and i don't think it was cooked to perfection as i noted a lot of dark spots through out the fish.  still edible though, well seasoned and nicely portioned.  all the sides were the great.  the chorizo puree stuff nearly had me licking my plate. drinks blew me away, lemon-rosemary spritz was so refreshing and not too sweet and the chardonnay with my meal was excellent.  pecan brownie dessert special was decadent and just a great treat. will be back when and if i find myself back in po-town!
We came from California to celebrate our 3rd anniversary here. The food was amazing, they reserved the VIP table in the window for us, and made special menus that said "Happy Anniversary" on them for us. The atmosphere is awesome, we loved it. Took a stroll on the Walkway Over The Hudson to watch the sunset before dinner.
Exceptionally good meal, excellent service and great ambiance. Turns out it's restaurant week in the Hudson Valley - $29 price fixe. Highly recommend.
CRAVE is one of those places that is truly worthy of Yelp's 5 stars. We arrived on a Tuesday evening, checking the place out because we are considering using sister restaurant Lola's as our wedding caterer.  We ended up being the only people in the restaurant for our entire dinner service and had a personal kitchen and server to ourselves. The chef sent a complimentary small taste of a pea soup to start out the meal.  It was really flavorful and tasty - there were notes of garlic and it tasted really nice.  Our bread was next, and again this tasted nice and fresh. I started off with the shrimp wontons and my fiancée had the appetizer-sized risotto special.  The wontons were great - came out piping hot (one of the nice things about having the restaurant to yourself), and the edamame/seaweed garnish paired really well with the shrimp and the slightly spicy dipping sauce.  The risotto was also fantastic.  The veggies tasted nice and fresh.  The rice was definitely done enough... maybe a bit too done, but that's a lot better than getting served a crunchy risotto. I ordered the sea bass for my entrée, and the fiancée ordered the duck.  Both mains were excellent - very nice seasoning on the bass with a nice mix in the garnish sitting below the fish (I think I spotted golden raisins in there).  The fish was nice and moist - the juices just oozed out when I used my fork to cut into it.  The duck just melted in your mouth; very nicely cooked and the seasoning was spot on.  Eddie (chef/owner) came out after we had finished and told us that the duck was his favorite thing on the menu... so if you are in doubt, the duck is probably a great option. We finished with a flourless chocolate cake and a strawberry cannoli.  I really liked the cake, my fiancée who isn't a chocolate maven thought it was fine.  She really enjoyed the cannoli, I was kind of meh on that... so I guess we ordered the right desserts! If you are in the Mid-Hudson Valley and are looking for a fine dining restaurant, this is the place to go, hands down.  We spent around $125 including drinks and tip for a 3-course meal and I felt like it was a great value considering the very high quality of the food and the personalized service.  Granted, we were prospective clients, but still I feel like the experience would have still been great.  If you are looking for an intimate dinner, I'd highly recommend going on Tuesday or Wednesday, when you should have no trouble getting a table, and can enjoy the attentive service!
Went here for mainly apps and drinks so I can't comment much on dinner. BUT what I did have was delicious! The arepa app was very good, and sizable for an app. I really enjoyed sitting out on their patio under the heat lamps and knocking back a few drinks with friends. Very relaxing and chill environment as far as the outside goes!
All the CIA restaurants were packed (graduation) so one of the CIA staff recommended Crave.  Food was excellent, I really enjoyed the special - Arctic Char prepared sous vide.  Our party of 4 also shared severals appetizers, all very good although portions were a little too small to share.  The wait staff service was good, a little inexperienced, but definitely working to please.  I would eat here again.
This is probably my favorite place to dine at for special occasions on the "other" side of the river.  When I went last March it had just opened so it was very hard to get a reservation but I was not disappointed.  The bar area was nicely designed and the dining area, while a little cramped, was elegant.  The menu was mouth watering! I had salmon with green beans over a chili oil with a delicious hominy cake that oozed flavor.  While the salmon was perfectly cooked, I did find two bones in it which was the only reason why this place isn't five stars.  I would definitely like to go back here in the near future!
A friend of mine from Poughkeepsie wanted to meet here for dinner (I had been here before a few years ago) and I agreed because I remembered the food being good.  The restaurant is small but beautifully decorated and very dimly lit to give it a very romantic feel.  Perfect for date nights but laid back enough to catch up with some friends  The menu is extremely small and nothing really jumped out at me.  I ordered the kale Caesar salad and the ancho chile and coffee rubbed short ribs (and I was not very excited about either).  I was absolutely blown away when the food arrived!  Each course was absolutely delicious.  The Caesar salad salad was perfectly dressed and the short ribs were some of the best I have ever had.  I ordered wine with meal and their wine list was pretty decent.  My friend ordered 2 specialty cocktails off of their menu and she said they were both delicious.  The second one was served in a very cool almost copper looking mug (nice touch).    I only have 2 (minor) complaints.  The first is that the parking situation is not amazing and the second is that I felt the menu was a little too limited.  Neither of these things would prevent me from coming back because overall I had a wonderful experience.
One of my favorite dinner places in the area. Great food and service!
I really enjoyed eating here, im not big on trying different things but this place made me enjoy it! I enjoyed the stuffed duck summer or spring roll. Delicious! A lil on the pricey side but every once in awhile to treat yourself, its worth it!
A quite, cozy "bistro style" eatery near the entrance to the Walkway over the Hudson" .  A nice wine list complements the "New American" menu. There is a small bar in the back of the restaurant, and an outside patio offering much needed additional seating in summer.
Very nice experience.  Just happened to be taking a Sunday drive and fell upon Crave.  It was restaurant week and we ordered from the Special restaurant week menu.  The food and presentation was very nice.  I especially enjoyed my Honey Lavender Creme Brule. Very nice ambience and the waitstaff was very helpful and friendly.  Would recommend.
Went with some friends, I had fish while others had the Chicken special and fish special. The food was fresh and well prepared but just didn't have memorable flavors. Worth a try but not a fav.
Crave is a really nice, comfortable restaurant and the space is well designed with soft lighting and colors. Pre dinner cocktail was delicious and well made. The food was good, but very salty. I can not remember the exact dish I had, but I think it was Pecan Crusted Chicken or something close to that. It would have been really really good had there not been so much salt in it--it was almost like there was a miscommunication or something in the kitchen. But other than that, we enjoyed our experience and would go back. The server was courteous and prompt, if a bit unpolished. A nice fella. We will go back, for sure!
I can't believe it took me this long to try Crave. I had heard great things and figured it would be ok - wrong. It was a rave gem in the Hudson Valley. So much so that it gets my first yelp! review. Everything here is done right. The portion size, the creativity of menu, the decor and attentiveness of the staff. What I tried: Pear Salad - excellent A special app - a cheese ball with cream in the middle - wow! John Dory fish special - creative idea that works for the taste buds. Hanger steak - great sauce Bread pudding- the best I have Ever eaten. I do have one complaint about Crave, it's too far from my house!
This review is long overdue. One of my favorite places to go when I am looking for a quite and relaxing evening out with my wife.  The food is excellent. They don't overfill your plate. It's always the perfect amount of food..  At times we will go for a drink and appetizer.  If you are looking for a good meal in a relaxing and romantic environment, Crave is your place.
This place was so quaint and cozy, I didn't know what to expect. Small plates are the best. Pork Belly and other indulgences have left me craving to return.
Met a friend at Crave last night.  Had a very nice Pino and good time at the bar.  The Kitchen is just off the bar, saw the staff bring out what looked to be well presented and prepared dishes.  The Cesar Salad looks dynamite.  Sure to be back for diner.
This is a great local restaurant.   I took my wife to Crave for her birthday.   The food is above average.   So I would definitely go there again.
We had reservations for the patio and luckily it was a perfect night!  This is a cute, modern restaurant right off of the Walkway Over the Hudson which we were visiting. For starters I had the pear salad with blue cheese and pecans.  It was amazing and I am going to try to recreate it at home.  My husband had a special of mussels with a beer broth and was very happy with them. I had a grouper special with a cranberry sauce, spinach and roasted squash.  It was really yummy and a generous portion of fish.  My husband had  the ploughman's plate but was a little disappointed in the lack of flavor with some of the offerings.  We had a nice New Zealand SB.  Service was good and atmosphere was nice.  All in all a nice dining experience.
I now know why it's called CRAVE!!!
HIGHLY recommend!  Visiting from Los Angeles and relatives took us here for our anniversary.  We eat out a lot and loved everything about this restaurant.   Service - very attentive.  Never had to ask for more water or when was the meal coming.  Everything flowed effortlessly.   As a Southerner, I was wary of ordering a favorite Southern dish in Poughkeepsie, NY, but my shrimp and grits were some of the best I've ever had.  Nice size portions, especially the salads.  I like an ambiance where you have attention to detail but it's not overwhelming, so I really felt comfortable here.   Both the vegetarians and meat lovers raved about their meals.  Looking forward to our next visit.
My wife and I went to Crave for a nice, quiet, dinner for two, and it did not disappoint. Of the "upscale" restaurants in Poughkeepsie, this one has been the best overall dining experience for us. We were seated in a very nice alcove, just off the door, but out of the way of any traffic. Our waitress was attentive, but not overly so, and very knowledgeable regarding the food and wine. The bread (an herb foccacia) is brought out, as needed (you never have an empty plate,) and is served warm. For starters, we a bowl of the gumbo (very nicely done with plenty of shrimp and andouille sausage,) and the Brussels sprout salad. The salad is very unique, but excellent. I definitely recommend getting it. For entrees we had the filet mignon, with mashed potato and grilled vegetables and the Branzino (Mediterranean Sea Bass) with beet/barley risotto and horseradish foam. The beef was perfectly cooked and the combination of the vegetables and potato was unbeatable. The fish was also perfectly cooked (not over nor under done) and the beet/barley risotto was a fantastic addition. I would have like more of the horseradish foam, as it added a delicate flavor to the overall dish, but forgot to ask for more (they would have brought it out, if I had.) Amazingly, after all of this, we have room to share a dessert. We ordered the flour-less chocolate torte. I usually find these to be a bit dry, but the one we have at Crave, baked in it's own cup, with a dash of gelatto and whipped cream was oh so moist and flavorful. We both ordered wine by the glass, so I can not comment on the bar, but it looked very nice and the other patrons' ordered the specialty cocktails. All in all, we could not have asked for a better dinner evening.
The best deal for Hudson Valley Restaurant Week 2011. Its ambiance is simply intimate and inviting. They have a comprehensive of martini, although I did not order one for the night. Instead my friend and I ordered a bottle of cab. Menu is small but comprehensive to cater diverse taste or mood. The kitchen was serving us a nice shrimp toast like-amuse bouche with tequilla lime butter aioli - wish that the bread was slightly thinner. Accompanying rosemary bread was served fresh from the oven with its simply divine crust.   The starter of  braised and barbequed pork belly with sour and spicy consomme, which was reminding me the thai or vietnamese style BBQ meats - it was well smoked and nicely caramelized. My main was another braising item - espresso stout braised ribs with sweet potato espuma and pickled julienned vegetables to give a nice crunch to the melt-in-your mouth braised meat. Dessert of red velvet cake with cream cheese ice cream and was a little bit meltdown from the whole courses as it could not bring up to its standard on par to their savoury dishes, which other it will make it a perfect full five star rating. Well, I guess it is because the lack of pastry chef in the kitchen.
My hubby & I visited Crave for the first time last night for Valentine's Day and we really enjoyed it. The servers were very attentive and friendly and the atmosphere felt peaceful even on a busy holiday.  They have one entire wall covered with little votives which gave it a romantic atmosphere. I was really happy with the food and we are picky when we go out. They started us out with a little bite of bruschetta and delicious fresh herb bread. We were ordering off the Valentine's Day menu and I had the crab cake app and the scallops for my entree. Both were wonderful. My hubby ordered duck which was presented nicely even though I don't care for duck. The polenta cake that came with it was so good that I had to keep stealing it. The only thing that was a little bothersome was it is small so the tables are close together and it felt a little claustrophobic to us. I should add here though that we are sasquatches so we often feel like this. :) It certainly wouldn't discourage us from going back. It was a lovely evening out.
Excellent food, great ambiance, friendly staff.  The best place in the area
We chose Crave as the restaurant in which we wanted to celebrate our 30th anniversary this past weekend.  Wow...what a terrific experience!.  Not only was all the food delicious, but the staff took the trouble to replace one of the pages in the menu with a special page that was titled "30th Anniversary Specials".  Our server was a doll and extremely helpful.  We can't say enough good things about Poughkeepsie's Crave!
Owner manager was rude and nasty when we called  4 hours prior to reservation at 4:30 and had to cancel  because our 7year old came down with a stomach bug.thought I was being polite to take the time to call and cancel but he was rude and told us he was going to charge my charge card which he had taken the number as part of the reservation.would never recommend or have any desire to eat there
