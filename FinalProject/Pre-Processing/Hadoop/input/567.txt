Nacre continues to impress me and fill my dorky desire to see modern dance presented in new and unexpected ways. The production that i saw of Nacre's collaboration with Mosaic Arts Opera last night met my expectations for the unexpected. I tend not to expect to see quality modern dance choreography when its attached to a collaboration with anything other than a pit orchestra and off set choir (moving that many bodies on stage together can lead to utter chaos, but that didn't happen). The choreography made the dancers the living/moving set for Orfeo ed Euridice with Mosaic-Arts at Universal Preservation Hall. The company director made the decision to use not only the stage, but to break down that wall between audience and performer, which I think shows bravery on her part (its very vulnerable to be dancing among the audience) and brilliance in her staging. The work that I saw last night while it wasn't cutting edge modern dance, it was high quality choreography and performance execution. It also made not only modern dance more accessible to the audience but made the opera in general more accessible to the audience. I am excited to see additional collaborations between Nacre and Mosaic (who ever said there is nothing going on with the performing arts in the Capital Region, clearly doesn't know where to look). My only criticism is that the stage presence of the dancers out shined the singers, which isn't a bad thing for the dance company, but hopefully encourages the singers to take some pointers and direction from the people they are collaborating with that know all about moving on stage and stage presence. It is also great to watch the growth of the dance company as their home space at Universal Preservation Hall grows and completes itself as well.
