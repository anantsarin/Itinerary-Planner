The only reason I give this place 3 stars is because of the food. Honestly if this review was based solely on food quality I would give it 4 stars. The service is horrible each and every time I go there. The servers do not know their menu in the slightest (I place that more on training than anything else). Also the time it takes to get food is almost unbearable.  Pizza takes some time; I get that but 25 minutes for a side salad when there are empty tables throughout the restaurant is nuts. In all honesty I will probably continue going there occasionally as my fiancé has a gluten allergy and they have a great gluten free menu. It's unfortunate that the service is so terrible because this could be a great place with better service.

I would give 5000 stars for the tomato soup. My sister ordered it and she didn't finish it, so guess who did? ME. It's like a liquid hug. You can tell they use A LOT of cream in it and that's what makes it so enveloping. But I loved the fresh basil in there and the overall texture. My second favorite thing eaten here today was the pepperoni pizza. Reminded me of the pizza in the movie Mystic Pizza! Haha! We ordered a large because at a table nearby, it looked sooooooo good! And it was! Now, the sauce is basic but very fresh tomato tasting, not loaded with spices, as it tends to be on some pizzas, but I actually like it this way. The cheese was great, and the pepperoni stole the show! Burnt, crispy edges. Mmmmmm! The dough was great too. Soft and squishy and a pleasure to chew. Loved it! I ordered the chopped salad, probably because it promised me prosciutto, which happens to be one of my favorite food groups. Ha! It was good overall. The balsamic dressing was great, though a tad on the sweet side. I loved the roasted red peppers on the salad too. My mom got the ham focaccia with pasta salad and it was only okay. I know now that their strong suit lies in the mystic pizza and tomato soup. Mmmmm! We had a great meal overall and thought we'd have a lot to take home, but the 3 of us ate through a good portion of the pizza because it was so good! This isn't far from home, but it's not terribly close. If it was, I'd get pizza from here all the time! Yum!
My Tomato Pie has pizzas, as the name implies--but also a HUGE menu of sandwiches, salads, and pasta dishes. There are a LOT of vegetarian selections, and they're all clearly marked on the menu with a little red tomato. (Note: The menu on their website is far from complete for some reason; the actual menu is much larger.) I started the meal with a bowl of amazingly rich and creamy tomato-basil soup topped with house-made croutons and and melty asiago cheese ($4.95). This is something I order every time I come here--it's that good. My friend ordered a delicious looking salad topped with grilled chicken. I've been eating here for years, and my visit earlier this week was actually the first time I've ever ordered the pizza, but it won't be the last. My friend and I split a small Rebecca pizza ($12.95), a white pizza with roasted red peppers, caramelized onions, mozzarella, and asiago cheese. For $2 extra, I added kalamata olives to my half; she added jalapenos to hers. Everything about the pizza was just right--sweet and salty toppings atop a crispy, flavorful crust. There's plenty of seating (including a banquet area that can be reserved) and a pretty decent wine menu. The service has always been good. Definitely a go-to spot when I venture out into the northtowns!

Tonight I took my mother, from California, to My Tomato Pie for dinner. I took her there because I have had good experiences before. Tonight, was not the case. We ordered stuffed mushrooms which came out without the bread. The waitress said the breadsticks  were "cooking" and brought them 15 minutes later. After she brought our two breadsticks she immediately brought out our sandwiches. I had the veggie pita. It was essentially a bagged salad drenched in dressing pouring out of a stale pita with Absolutely no hummus on the sandwich, which was the first ingredient in the menu description. I would have told the waitress and ordered something else but she never came back to find out how everything was, in fact she never came back at all. We actually had to flag her to pay for our meal. When I expressed my dissatisfaction with the sandwich and explained how there was no hummus she told me "oh sorry it doesn't usually come with hummus it's just a veggie pita". As a former waitress, I would suggest that knowing the menu might be a integral part of training any new waitresses. I have never left a restaurant without tipping. In fact, I usually tip 25%. Tonight, I had no choice. Not only did we pay 35.00 for a meal we did not enjoy, but we had no service! I will never be back to My Tomato Pie again, and will certainly not recommend it to any friends or coworkers. I highly suggest making better service a top priority in their  next meeting.

THE BEST GLUTEN FREE PIZZA IN WNY! I was  diagnosed with Celiac Disease 2004 and am forced to follow a strict gluten free diet.  Because I come from a food and beverage  background and love to eat out, I have explored pretty much EVERY gluten free rest. in WNY.  My Tomatoe Pie has it down pat!  They fully understand cross contamination . The owner,  Tony personally researched the gluten free diet before introducing the menu items to the public. He tried all the pastas and pizza doughs before finding the ones he felt are the best.  What a great job he did!  Pasta is cooked in a dedicated GF pot of water, Pizzas are cooked on their own gf pan and cut with a clean pizza cutter. Kitchen and wait staff are trained and well aware how important it is NOT to mix up the orders. The pizza is a nice size, has a medium thick crust and can come with red sauce or white.  Your choice of GF toppings are numerous. GF Redbridge beer is offered too so pizza and a beer is a nice treat when dining out!   If you are looking for a wonderful array of fabulous GF food.....try My Tomatoe Pie for lunch or dinner soon. Unlike Pizza Plant they offer GF food every day of the week. You will NOT be dissapointed. - Kathy Otto Gluten free in WNY since 2004

Can't have a bad meal here. The pizzas are delicious. And honestly, the salads are really good too.....and this is coming from a dude. It's great for a date or for the whole family. Or for friends who are really picky. -1 star for the decor and layout. The front room is very cramped and gets quite a draft from the front doors. The side room is very large and the tables are awkwardly spaced. There's ugly-as-heck checkerboard flooring in the soda shop / bar area. I say take a bulldozer to the place and start over. But great service and better-than-normal quality pizza. Even great for take-out too. I hate the font used in their menu, too. But that's just me.

I recently hosted my sister's baby shower of about 30 people at My Tomato Pie. Never having been to My Tomato Pie (I live in NYC) and going only on the recommendation of my sister, I took a risk and booked this restaurant for a Saturday afternoon shower. I am happy to report that my risk was well worth taking, because the food was delicious and the service we were given was friendly, fast, and attentive. In addition, My Tomato Pie looks great on the inside with ample seating, making the atmosphere warm and welcoming-perfect for a baby shower! Lastly, their prices were extremely reasonable.

Gotta love social networking.  I discover a fair amount of new places via Yelp, but in this case I found My Tomato Pie with the help of Foursquare.   I think that after working in an amazing gourmet pizza restaurant near Boston, MA (Emma's Pizza, if you're ever in the neighborhood - they're wonderful) I became a bit of a pizza snob.  Other pizza in Boston wasn't that great, and I have to admit I've had a hard time finding a good pie here in Buffalo.   I chose My Tomato Pie because it looked like there was a fair chance I could find some decent pizza.   My husband and I arrived around 7:00 on a Friday night, and were seated immediately.  I know a lot of people have complained about the service, but our server was quick, friendly and knowledgeable (and kind of adorable).  We asked her what we should order.  In her words, "our pizza is very good, but our pasta is UH-MAZING."   With those words of praise ringing in our ears, my husband ordered spaghetti and meatballs, while I requested the mac and cheese (my favorite).  We also decided to split a caesar salad as an appetizer (note: caesar salads are only served in full sized portions (like, this could be a meal unto itself) - you can't request one as a side salad).   The salad was awesome.  Creamy dressing (not oily - a plus), and they used just enough.  I think I would have preferred freshly grated parmesan cheese as opposed to the stuff in the canister, but I'm nitpicking.  The lettuce was fresh and crispy.  Loved it. My husband remarked that his spaghetti and meatballs was pretty good.  He enjoyed the light, sweet, bright sauce.  While the meal was fairly basic, the meatballs were spiced well and gigantic.  The pasta was not al dente, but not overdone. My mac and cheese was good.  I wouldn't call it amazing, but I liked the Gemeli pasta - not only was it cooked well, but the shape held the sauce nicely.  The sauce was a wee bit Velveeta-ish, but maybe that's just me having had one too many shells 'n cheese nights.  I enjoyed it, though. Here's the thing.  The menu is extensive, and there are so many options that I know we'll be back multiple times to try them.  The table next to us shared a panini (yes, apparently they're that big), and it looked like perfection.  (Note: they also shared the same salad as we did - looks like two people can comfortably split a sandwich and a salad and come out happy.)  I noticed a couple pizzas at other tables, and they looked pretty great, too. Though I enjoyed it, I don't think pasta is the best thing to order here.  Everything else looks reeeeally good, and I'll probably update this review as we try more.  I would still come back for the pasta, though. Oh, and not only are they vegetarian friendly (a big plus in my book), but they also have an extensive selection of gluten-free items.  Bonus points!

Great gluten free options and clearly labeled on the menu.  I created my own gluten free pizza and the crust and red sauce were tasty.  The crust was a thin crust and it was cooked to a lightly browned crispy perfection.  The red sauce was tasty and the toppings were well portioned. If I lived closer I would go there more often.  Anytime I'm in the area, I would definitely go back to try the gluten free pasta.

We ambled in at a tad before noon. I was the lone male in the room. We sidled to the counter/bar waiting several minutes before being greeted and offered menus. Our morning had been hectic and the afternoon showed no promise of improvement. Drinks may help. "What gin are you pouring?" I asked. "Uh, gin, uh" the reply. Lotsa workers milling about getting very little done. Bottom line:       Two gins, Spicy tuna wrap w/chips, adios Tomato Pie, you're history.

The food is delicious, but the service can be a little bit on the slow side. Nonetheless, their sandwiches are really great and come with a side of pasta salad which works for me, as I am not a fan of fries. Pasta Maria is the real reason I used to come. Its tortellini in a cream sauce with portabella, baby bella and sometimes porcini mushrooms. It's one of the most delicious, unhealthiest things you can possibly have. The good news is the portion is so huge you can make 3 dinners out of it. Their buttermilk ranch dressing is the best I've ever had. I believe they make it in-house. Also, great place for vegetarians as they have plenty of veg options which are marked on their menu with a little picture of a carrot. Don't come if you're in a rush. The service can be on the slow side. However, it's worth the wait.

Eh..... not terrible, but not all that great either.  It's a cute place..... nice and clean and bright and much bigger than outward appearances would suggest.  And, the service is very friendly and efficient. It's just that the food isn't all that great.  The house salad with tomato basil dressing (homemade!) was good, but unfortunately it was downhill from there.  And, I had such high hopes because I really loved that salad dressing! I figured I'd go pretty basic and order spaghetti and meatballs.  That way I could experience the homemade sauce and meatballs.  I figure it's a good way to get the essence of a new place.  Then on subsequent visits I can get more adventurous.  Well.... this dish wasn't good at all.  First off, the spaghetti was mushy and not all that hot.  It tasted like it was cooked days ago and then reheated by dunking a strainer-full into a pot of boiling water.  Not good!  Then the sauce had no flavor at all.  It tasted like canned tomato sauce mixed with canned tomato paste.  That's it.  No spices... no herbs.... no flavor.  And the meatballs were more like bread-balls.  Seriously beef deficient.  So very sad!   The garlic bread stick on the side of my plate was pretty good... but unfortunately not quite good enough to get me to come back.

Went to dinner last Monday with a friend.  Prior to I hadn't been here for about 5 years.  I think I had stopped going because of the small space.  They have since expanded very nicely. Service was great, wine good and decor very appropriate.   To start we split a personal pizza: goat cheese and spinach...AWESOME! My friend had the ravioli, which she loves there. I had the pizza salad with chicken.  Thought the menu said the salad came on the pizza crust, but the pizza ( actually more of a no sauce cheese pizza), came on a separate plate. I never clarified this because it really didn't matter.  Salad was good with the tomato basil dressing.  Chicken was tender and moist with a bit of crispness.  Nicely done.  Pizza was great!   Splurged and split the health bar pie.  A good way to end the meal! Thoroughly enjoyed it. Good company, good food, good restaurant.  Can't go wrong!

Ate there several years ago & was always good.  I took friends there last night & was very disappointed.  I thought the quality of the food was very bad! Probably will not return.

I have many things to say about My Tomato Pie.....I can't explain to anyone why I would continue giving it more and more chances, but I do. When my husband and I first went, we loved it.  We went back a few times, recommended it to others, took his parents....all good.  Then, we started getting takeout.....still happy. And then things started going downhill sometime in 2011. Customer service for takeout was horrifically slow....food famously not ready until twenty minutes after they tell you, and several staff would stare at you but not greet or help you. Food was occasionally wrong, but not too bad on this front.  but then the quality started to suffer too....and that's where we are today.  I liked it so much before that I've given it "one more time" at least four times now. Today my husband's pizza was very dry, too bready....and at 16 dollars for a large pepperoni and cheese, it was so overpriced for something that may have been the quality of a decent frozen pizza- its not like it's extra big either.  And then my chicken pesto panini was made with what I'm guessing was jarred, not fresh pesto, which lacked in flavor, freshness, and overall quality. And the pasta salad, while ripe with delicious favors, was so dry I had to add olive oil at home to make it edible. I'd say at over nine dollars, I was more than disappointed. It was worth maybe six.....in a hospital or school cafeteria.   I think MTP has reached it's last "last chance" with me.

Eating here is a bizarre experience. It seems caught between two worlds, not committing to either and not doing either terribly well.  The decor is sort of low-grade-high-class... you know, like a friend who buys all her home furnishings at Target.  You walk in and you guess it kind of looks okay, but the more you think about it, the uglier the all chrome and lime green starts looking. Perusing the menu evokes a similar experience.  They have a wine list.  They also have nachos. And, I gotta say... the nachos are pretty damn good.  But there's no way anyone could enjoy them while the table next to you is being served their cabernet.  Chances are they can't very much enjoy wine next to your nachos, either. Entrees are nothing to write home about either.  I've been there three or four times (what can i say?  my roomate really loves the place) and they're 0 for 3.  the pasta has never been more than something i could've whipped up with my own anemic cooking skills.   (boil water, apply ragu)  The last time, I got a salad... something for the health-consicious petty bourgeois, if that brings anything to mind.  it was presented beautifully, i have to say. I don't know, if you don't like food or if you've made a date with an impressionable lady or gentleman, My Tomato Pie is probably an okay choice. Prices are about what you'd expect... 10 - 15 bucks a head.

I normally don't crave foods but their strawberry goat cheese salad with a side of pizza crust and marinara sauce is usually all I get here and I love it so much I try to get there at least every other week. Last week I did have a Hawaiian pizza and it was delicious; and their bruschetta pizza I get as an appetizer (I share) is soooo good. This restaurant is not fancy (at all) and is located in a plaza which I normally wouldn't even try but someone suggested it about 4 years ago to me and I can't get enough...I meet friends and family there often for lunch and dinner and it never disappoints. Definitely worth checking out; menu is huge I just stick with my cravings!
Eating here is a bizarre experience. It seems caught between two worlds, not committing to either and not doing either terribly well.  The decor is sort of low-grade-high-class... you know, like a friend who buys all her home furnishings at Target.  You walk in and you guess it kind of looks okay, but the more you think about it, the uglier the all chrome and lime green starts looking. Perusing the menu evokes a similar experience.  They have a wine list.  They also have nachos. And, I gotta say... the nachos are pretty damn good.  But there's no way anyone could enjoy them while the table next to you is being served their cabernet.  Chances are they can't very much enjoy wine next to your nachos, either. Entrees are nothing to write home about either.  I've been there three or four times (what can i say?  my roomate really loves the place) and they're 0 for 3.  the pasta has never been more than something i could've whipped up with my own anemic cooking skills.   (boil water, apply ragu)  The last time, I got a salad... something for the health-consicious petty bourgeois, if that brings anything to mind.  it was presented beautifully, i have to say. I don't know, if you don't like food or if you've made a date with an impressionable lady or gentleman, My Tomato Pie is probably an okay choice. Prices are about what you'd expect... 10 - 15 bucks a head.
I wish my calzone had more stuffing, but the wide variety of pizza/calzone toppings made up for it.  Overall it was a good meal.  If you're passing through town and looking for a food adventure, you won't find it here, but if I lived in the neighborhood, I'd probably go here twice a month.

Amazing food, great atmosphere and attentive service. My favorite is the Philly cheesesteak pizza or the strawberry and goat cheese salad.

Nestled in the corner of a strip mall on Sheridan drive, My Tomato Pie isn't a restaurant people would normally go to as one of their usual stand-bys.  It's tucked between a Manhattan Bagel and Taste of India, and not near any shops of importance.  However, my co-workers and I decided to give it a shot for lunch the other day, and we weren't disappointed. When we walked in it was busy, but we were seated promptly.  Our waitress was quick to offer us drinks and to take our orders.  I ordered a personal pizza, while my co-workers ordered a calzone and a chicken wrap.  Our food came out in record-breaking speed, which is great when you only have 30 minutes for lunch (thankfully we work in the same plaza).  My pizza was pipping hot, crispy, and about the size of a large dinner plate.  The sauce was great, there was lots of cheese and sausage on it.  For less than five dollars, it was a much better lunch than the Big Mac I was pondering about earlier in the day!  My co-workers also liked their food, and did not have any complaints.     The personal pizza was a great deal for the money, and something I would definitely order again when I go back.  The menu items average about $7-$10 for wraps, salads, pizzas, and calzones.  Wine is also available.   My Tomato Pie gets four stars for good service, good value, and for a kick-ass personal pizza.  However, they lost a star for having mismatched napkins (it cheapens the feel of the restaurant, sorry) and for seating me at an odd table (a table where there was a booth on one side, and two chairs on the other - wheelchair accessible I'm assuming).  If you want a quick, reasonable meal, My Tomato Pie is worth checking out if you're in the area.

I would start of by saying that the restaurant was way bigger than I expected it to be. From the outside I just concluded it was just an order your pizza/pick up joint. But the decor and the atmosphere was large. Variety of pastas and interesting selections of pizzas. The service was very friendly and the food was fresh. I had to bump down on the stars because there were a gang of flies attacking my food a few minutes after it arrived. But that only happened once. I would recommend the Zesty Chicken Pasta for a nice spicy delight.

I go here once every couple of months and have yet to have a bad meal.  The waitresses are knowledgeable and friendly, always willing to accomodate the customer in the case of a bad meal, which was very, very rare for people in my party.   This is the only restaurant I enjoy ordering a salad for an entree.  The chicken caesar has some good dressing that isn't overpowering, and the chicken is grilled and flavorful.  Order a side of the pizza crust with it.  Their pastas are also a good option.  The best menu option for me had to be the calzone.  I ordered the chicken finger calzone and it was probably the best I've had.  Very much recommended.  Only gripe I have is the pizza.  I never thought it was the best when other people I was with ordered it, but there are many tremendous options to go with here.

My rating is based on the service, not the food. I've been here once before and the gluten free pizza I ordered was good. Today, we got seated after about 10 minutes of waiting. Not bad at all for a Friday. However, no one came to take our orders for at least 20 minutes. Meanwhile, we see several waitresses cleaning other tables and waiting on other tables. We left after 30 minutes of waiting. For the 30 minutes we were sitting there, we got no service; no hello, no water, no nothing. We ended up just walking out. This is definitely my last time here!!.

So happy to have found a place that has so many delicious gluten free options!  My favorites are the blackened zesty chicken on gf pasta and the tomato soup is out of this world.  The homemade tomato salad dressing is terrific as well.  The wine here is the best deal in all of Buffalo.  Great for a quiet date night out.  Could use a facelift but the food is great, service we can't complain, and prices you just can't beat. Love it!

I haven't been here in awhile since I don't live as close to it as I once did, but I had a bridal shower here the other day and I was just as pleased as always afterwards.  The restaurant is nice looking, and the back half of it was closed off for our event.  The service was pretty good, and I guess they were short on staff so they made up for it with effort.  The food was awesome; there was four kinds of sandwiches (blackened chicken, turkey, ham, and portabella mushroom on various types of specialty breads), pasta salad, regular salad, and an assortment of cookies.  I had the turkey and chicken sandwiches, and they were both really delicious.  The pasta salad was great as well, but desserts are my true love, and the cookies did not disappoint.  I would definitely consider this place as a venue for an event.  It was organized, great food, and an overall nice setting.

The decor and service was excellent. The server was really great and attentive, especially with my food allergies. I gave such a bad review because the food here is just not that great at all. We ordered the fried green tomatoes as an appetizer, the tomatoes were in there but I couldn't taste them in the slightest because of the sheer amount of batter and breading on it. My friend got the shrimp scampi in which the shrimp were over cooked, the sauce was oily and there was cheese on top (I have never seen on shrimp scampi before). I got a personal pizza with sausage and broccoli. The pizza crust was very sweet, it reminded me of an old fashioned doughnut, the sauce was also overly sweet. This is probably a great pizza for kids but not for adults. I gave it 2 stars solely on the basis of the excellent service we received and the decor, but the food just is simply not good at all, and that is really the most important thing to me. I would rate the food 1/5 and service 5/5 so hence 3/5. This place has the potential to be really great but they need to hire a new chef.
I've tried several good sandwiches here over several visits but I especially enjoyed their delicious sauce on a tasty cheese ravioli entree.  Salads are very good, too.  The service can be leisurely but that gives you time to consider some good desserts. There's a separate, big room for large groups, too. Prices are very reasonable, altogether a great dining experience.

Per the recommendation of our hotel front desk employee, some co-workers and I decided to try this place. I have an adventurous pallet, so for the first time ever, I asked ther server to surprise me with one of the popular family recipes. All I told her is that I had dined on beef earlier that day and I wasn't allergic to anything. She brought me a mixed greens salad topped with goat cheese, sliced strawberries, candied walnuts, and some sort of vinegrett dressing, with a side of foccacia bread. OMG!!! This salad was AMAZING!!! I never really thought fruit on a salad would be good, but this was outstanding! My co-workers had other dishes and each of them loved it too!!! If I am ever in Buffalo again, I will eat here for sure. Excellent service, great environment, and wonderful food. Go there.
Good place for lunch or dinner. They have a wide selection of Italian dishes and sandwiches, which are well prepared albeit a little on the pricey side. I enjoy service that is not rushed but I would have to say that the service is borderline on slow but not horribly detracting from the dining experience. When crowded the restaurant can become loud, but it is in no way rambunctious..
