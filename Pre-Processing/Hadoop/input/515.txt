I personal trained with Jolene when visiting Big Sky and also took Wendy's Barre Fusion class and think both were outstanding. Although Jolene does not use traditional free weights which I have always used in the past with other trainers, I was sore after each session and feel that I got fantastic workouts.  Jolene has a lot of experience as a personal trainer and her background in Pilates really sets her apart from others and I think she is outstanding in her field.  I highly recommend Jolene or anyone in her gym for personal training, any of her various classes or Pilates.
I was visiting family in Big Sky last week and took Jolene's 6am spin class. I have taken her pilates and bootcamp classes on past family trips here, and knew that I was going to sweat it out hard! I love how she keeps you motivated the whole time to keep going, and the intensity of the class is perfect for all levels- beginner to athlete. Will definitely be back again soon!!
