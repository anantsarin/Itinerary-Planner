Ive frequent Sam Sub's at least 3 times a week. When you walk in the door you're greeted with a smile. I can't just pick one favorite food item on the menu because I have so many that I love!! It's a great place to relax on your lunch hour and they even have dinner items. I highly recommend Sam's over any sandwich place in Charlotte County.
Went there on a friends recommendation, and had one of thr best chicken subs I've ever had. Service couldn't have been friendlier!! I'm going back as soon as I can!!
There are some places you go for the food and some the atmosphere, this is a place for both. The fun fact of Sams is that if your a local you will always see someone you know eating or picking up an order. Sam and Renee (the owners) are the most pleasant restauranteers in the area. Place is always packed in season and the food is always great. One thing to suggest is ask about the soups of the day, always homemade and always great. This is a simple great place to eat a good lunch and catch up on the local scene.
This place has a great atmosphere! The food is delicious too. The service is prompt and accurate. They have really comfy chairs. Go out of your way to come here.
This is the best place in town for soups , subs, burgers and salads. The owners are so nice. Prices are very reasonable.  You must try the fried cheesecake...sooooo yummy!
This Place brings Family friend fun food flavor all in one place. The values and energy they have are staggering.  They support the military, the neighborhood and the people in the area rave all about them. They are great people and the food is ever so better.
