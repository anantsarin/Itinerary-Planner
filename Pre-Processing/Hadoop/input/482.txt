I met the owner last night. Amazing guy; really nice. The place is always hopping after midnight and the clientele is attractive. I was in town on business and I went here every night, and every night I had a blast.
The orange is fantastic.  I love the happy hour when pitchers are like $4. Everyone is trashed after midnight,  so you're pretty much ensured fun.
Jammed packed quickly full of the Greek life in Syracuse. Go for the fish bowls, then head to Chucks.
Greek life heaven. Frats and Sororities at SU live at this bar on the weekends. It's small but that doesn't keep the crowds from piling in and dancing on the lower level by the bar. The lifeguard chair is a personal favorite of mine as well as the huge fishbowl drinks. Also, this is one of the few places in New York ( it is illegal )where you can smoke inside ! Sure, it's a small smoking room with tacky underwater paintings hidden in the back of the bar, but smokers love it ! Watch out, Syracuse cops are known to raid this bar on popular weekend nights.
I went here on a Saturday night.  The place was jam-packed with undergrads, yet I still had a blast.  I can't explain exactly what it was about this place, but it was a great time.  Cheap drinks, too!
Not a fan. Too loud, and way overpriced. Plus, none of my friends would share a fishbowl with me - so I waited on line forever and paid the cover and didn't do anything. Fun night - NOT.
love the fish bowls chill place, big frat/sorority scene going on, a bit pricier than other bars but overall good place to hang out.
I went here for a sorority party before and I had a blast! The bartenders were quick and super friendly and I loved dancing on the lower level by the DJ booth. It's a little small but the vibe is grreat!
The drinks are overpriced and the crowd can sometimes suck. You can smoke inside in their smoking room which is pretty rad so this place isn't the worst.
