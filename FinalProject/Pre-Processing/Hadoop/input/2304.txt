Some of the food at Spicy Asian is amazing. I really enjoy most of the Szechuan dishes -- best spicy asian food you can find in Ithaca. Unfortunately (1) the service has been poor every time I have gone, and (2) every entree item on the menu is overpriced. That being said, I will continue to order from here regularly while I'm in Ithaca. The food is good.
Certainly among the better Chinese options in Ithaca. The place is very spacious, so it'd be good choice for bigger parties. Lots of groups come here for lunch/dinner, not just because of the space but because they have lots of good options. Service is really efficient and friendly too. The dishes are meant for family style, but I came out here on my own so I couldn't really just order a bunch of dishes for a variety. I got the mapo tofu - something I usually get when I can't really decide what else to get. It was among one of the spicier versions I've ever had of it, which isn't necessarily bad but a little more than I can handle. For one person the dish will be more than enough, and I had enough to use for a second meal at home that night. Avoid the milk tea here though. It's just like any other milk tea in Ithaca - terrible. But you shouldn't be going to a Chinese restaurant specifically to get milk tea anyway (which is weird because I actually saw a few people come in and order just a milk tea to go). Come here for what you should be enjoying - a rare decent Chinese restaurant in upstate New York.
The outside of Spicy Asian is nothing special and you might drive right by it thinking it's just another fly-by-night Ithaca restaurant. But several people whose reviews I trust on Yelp said it was good, so we tried it. We were very happy! First of all, the staff is very friendly and the decor is really charming. They have done a great job with the restaurant and making it very welcoming, clean, and authentic. I felt great just walking in there. The menu is quite large and they have a huge selection ranging from every-day type Chinese food to more exotic Szechuan cuisine. They have a lot of appetizers and some fun things including boba tea. We tried several things and everything was hot, fresh, and very tasty. Nothing tasted like it had been sitting around in a serving pan or anything like that--it seems like everything came out steaming and freshly prepared just for us. I would recommend Spicy Asian to anyone around who wants some above-par Asian cuisine and very reasonable prices.
Stop ordering Boba and General Tso's, Sweet & Sour, or Orange flavored anything here. They don't do good Americanized Chinese food. Try these dishes instead! Favorite Appetizers: *1. Zhang Dou Dumplings - (aka Zhong Dumplings - in floral chili oil) 2. Scallion pancake - (the dipping sauce is fantastic) Favorite Meat Dishes: *1. Kung Po Chicken Szechuan style - (the classic intro dish to Szechuan cuisine) *2. Spicy Double cooked pork - (fatty pork with chilies and leeks) *3. Mongolian Beef or chicken - (the only non-Szechuan dish I've enjoyed here) 4. Cumin Lamb - (really famous Szechuan dish) Favorite Veggie Dishes: *1. Shredded Potatoes w. Sour Spicy Sauce - (intentionally undercooked crunchy) 2. Sautéed Snow Pea Sprout w. Garlic - (simple, but great side dish) 3. Dried Sauteed String Bean - (for the garlic lovers) 4. Eggplant with Szechuan flavor *5. Kung Po Tofu Szechuan style - (not on the menu, but they will do it if you ask for it, every vegan/vegetarian should try Kung Po, even if they can't eat meat) * = spicy dish Warning: there are some dishes that are deceptively named things like "Szechuan Flavored Chicken." These are surprisingly not Szechuan dishes. If its not on the last few pages of the Szechuan style menu, don't order it. I've been here several times since my initial review and have bad experiences with the Americanized dishes.
I'm sad to report that our most recent visit to the previously-delicious Spicy Asian was a big disappointment. The Szechuan eggplant was overcooked (read: mushy), bland-sauced, and very oily; the Cumin lamb was under-cooked, chewy, with none of the carmelized crisp edges that usually makes it so yummy (and had a couple pieces of bone/gristle). I hope this isn't a sign that they have peaked, or that they don't try as hard when the students are out of town!
Alright well it took me 4 years to finally try this place but I finally did, and boy am I glad for that. Coming from a Chinese person, this is hands down the best Chinese (Szechuan) food I have had in Ithaca by a landslide! Prices are very reasonable as well. We had cumin lamb, white cabbage spicy fried rice and a spicy pork/vege dish and everything was cooked perfectly. The lamb was actually crispy in some regards which and had curry powder which gave it a unique spicy taste. The white cabbage spicy fried rice was spicier than expected but some may like that more. Finally the pork vege dish was our favorite as the pork was tender and melted in your mouth. Overall, this is highly recommended, it is not like the greasy fake Chinese places that are abundant in Ithaca.
They messed up my order and gave me lo mein instead of rice.  The food itself honestly wasnt really that good and i wish I had ordered from somewhere else.  It tastes like cheap mall Chinese food and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking to get semi good quality food.  For the price, it definitely isn't worth it and I'd recommend somewhere else.
Spicy Asian has been making a lot of changes in their menu. They no longer offer the Japanese menu and they are making more changes to what they do offer. This probably a good thing. I thought they had too much on the menu to begin with. It is hard to do a lot of things well. I got a copy of the new menu and it looks like most the dishes that have been praised in the reviews will be staying. During my most recent visit we ordered three dishes and shared them, family style, the way you are supposed to. My friend doesn't like spicy or too weird but there are so many things on the menu that I haven't tried, that wasn't a problem. We ordered the Angelica Lamb Soup, the Sauteed Baby Bok Choy, and the Crispy Chicken w. House Special Sauce One order of  Angelica Lamb Soup is enough for four people. It is chunks of lamb with sliced angelica root in a savory broth. The lamb has skin and bits of bones. It seems to be a belly or rib cut. The Angelica root is pale and tastes a little like bitter carrot.  Angelica is a medicinal plant and tastes bitter. If you don't like bitter herbs don't try this. But lots of people do like bitter herbs. Bok choy is also a little bitter. The sauteed bok choy had lots of sliced garlic and a mild savory sauce.  Even with the large quantities of garlic it was not too spicy for my friend. The Crispy Chicken came with a sweet vinegar sauce that was a nice complement to the bitter herbs. The chicken was lightly dusted with cornstarch or flour and fried until crispy, and the sauce was light and tangy. It came with a side of rice for each of us. I don't order sweet and sour chicken at restaurants because the batter is usually too thick and greasy and the sauce is corn syrup and food coloring. But this Crispy Chicken was what sweet and sour chicken should taste like. We also had milk tea with tapioca pearls. My friend had peach flavored and I had green apple.  I'm trying to taste every milk flavor they have.  And I'm delighted with the options of tapioca pearls, fruit jelly, or flavored popping boba.
I've been to many sichuan restaurants before and this place is by far the worst. The first two experiences here were decent. The third time, I ordered the fish in chili oil (shui zhu yu) and it tasted like buffalo sauce. That's something I'd expect for chicken wings but not sichuan cuisine. We told the waitress and she insisted that's how they've always made the dish. That's not even the worst part... we found a little stone in the dish and they insisted that it was peppercorn. Peppercorn is supposed to be black and the stone was white... my only regret was not taking a picture before showing them as they were pretty quick to get rid of the evidence. Never again. Worst experience everrrr!!
Best option for REAL Chinese food in Ithaca. If you are looking for American-Chinese, there are probably better options elsewhere...but who's really checking Yelp for the best American-Chinese food, right? So when you go, just flip right to the last two pages of the menu, where they got the Szechuan dishes. It's true that the dishes will come out at different times as has been previously commented, so it works best if you order Chinese family style - that is, order a few dishes for the whole table to share. Food-wise, everything I've had so far is good. For Ithaca, it's the best authentic Chinese food. For elsewhere, it's pretty average. Which is to say, everything tastes good, maybe more oil than I would prefer, but not really knocking anything out of the park. My favorites are the eggplant hot pot and the steamed fish. Some of the spicy dishes are really quite spicy, so be prepared for a good sweat. Service is very friendly. That said, if you are trying to ask for any alterations to the dish, you may need to be patient explaining what you want, unless you speak Chinese.
Been going here regularly since it opened and I must say this is the best Chinese food in Ithaca.  Try the Phoenix & dragon or the salt & pepper fish.  Everything we have tried is great
salty & greasy, over priced. I am Chinese and I know how real good Chinese food should taste like. I love Szechuan food and I know spicy food are supposed to be a bit salty to spice up the flavor. But this is is wayyyyy too salty, so salty that I kept drinking water all the time. We order 4 or 5 dishes. All are very salty except that there is a lamb dish that's not bad, otherwise I would give a 1 star. BTW, if you are concerned about your health, don't go there too often. Eating too much sodium is bad for your health.
So I underestimated how spicy the food was that this place serves. In Ithaca there are a lot of places that claim to have wicked spicy food, but fail in that department, even when visiting any of the Thai places and ordering 5 spicy. This place though. The Kung Pao Chicken is quite possibly the hottest thing I have ever eaten in my life. There was so much spice I tasted nothing else. There were more peppers in the dish than chicken! I loved it though! It was great! Finally somewhere that actually lives up to their name and reputation! Would definitely order something a bit less spicy next time though haha. Other than that their regular dishes were pretty good. We got dumplings, lo mein and fried rice and it was good, not the best but good enough to keep me coming back. So go and try them out, it's one of the better chinese take out places in Ithaca. On a side note they have a good amount of seating inside to sit and enjoy your dinner.
There is nothing remarkable about the food here***.  The price is high and all the sauces seem to have the same texture even if they are a different "flavor."  The other day my party ordered general tofu, general chicken, sesame chicken, and beef & broccolli.  I tried all four dishes and as I mentioned, nothing remarkable.  Granted, the fact that they have a whole restaurant you can sit in with tablet service is nice.  But for straight up americanized chinese food I don't think I'll return here again.   My dish came well before my friend's food, which was a bit annoying.  By the time their food came mine had cooled down.  Mine was the beef and broccoli and it was rather unremarkable.  The portion size however, was good.  My rice was fine.  The service was great (it's not her fault the kitchen sent out my dish ahead of the others). *** I will say that I did not try the szechuan style dishes as other reviewers have mentioned as being great, but, if the waitress had mentioned it to me (the fact that it was their specialty) or even given me some szechuan specials to choose from I probably would have tried the them and been much happier.  So would the rest of my party- we are adventurous eaters and not afraid to try new things.  I simply don't see how they are going to stay in business if the popular dishes are mediocre and the stuff that really is good they don't try to highlight/mention.

Spicy Asian has the best real Chinese food in Ithaca. They specialize in Sichuan-style food, which is spicy and fresh. They have many authentic items that are not sold by your run-of-the-mill "takeout" Chinese places. That being said, they also have a menu of Americanized food (ironically called "Chinese food," to distinguish from the more authentic "Sichuan Style" menu). Twice cooked pork, eggplant sichuan style, salt and pepper squid, rice cake noodle, zhong jiaozi (dumpling), beef tripe hot pepper sauce (a cold dish commonly eaten as an appetizer in China) are all great choices. Great addition to the Ithaca food scene. Generous portions as well.
Certainly among the better Chinese options in Ithaca. The place is very spacious, so it'd be good choice for bigger parties. Lots of groups come here for lunch/dinner, not just because of the space but because they have lots of good options. Service is really efficient and friendly too. The dishes are meant for family style, but I came out here on my own so I couldn't really just order a bunch of dishes for a variety. I got the mapo tofu - something I usually get when I can't really decide what else to get. It was among one of the spicier versions I've ever had of it, which isn't necessarily bad but a little more than I can handle. For one person the dish will be more than enough, and I had enough to use for a second meal at home that night. Avoid the milk tea here though. It's just like any other milk tea in Ithaca - terrible.

Come here for what you should be enjoying - a rare decent Chinese restaurant in upstate New York.
Nothing wrong with the food here, but the portions were on the small side. I left hungry after a $10 entrée. Had some language barrier issues with the waitress. She didn't seem to understand our basic questions about the food.

We came here for the first time last week and appreciated the more authentic Chinese cuisine. Following Yelp advice, we had the cumin lamb (unlike any Chinese food I have ever had - loved it, very good, very spicy) and the eggplant with meat hot pot (nothing special). The rice servings were very small, which originally seemed a nice way to feature the main dishes, but in the end we were wishing for more rice to balance the spicy meat. Agree with others that the service was lacking - we ordered hot tea but then realized we really needed some water to cut down the heat. Could not get any server's attention. Eventually one passed by with water, but when she saw we had only tea cups, she turned away - we encouraged her to pour anyway. We never got water glasses but did get a water refill in the tea cups. Very strange to be drinking water from a tea cup still warmed by tea, but it was necessary!
Alright well it took me 4 years to finally try this place but I finally did, and boy am I glad for that.

First, the food is good. However, the service, especially when it comes to take out, sucks. Every time I have ordered from them they don't include the sauce that the menu says comes with the dish and the last time I ordered they didn't even give me soy sauce or chopsticks. They are also vague about ingredients which, as someone who doesn't eat beef or pork, is extremely annoying. I ordered a shrimp dish that no where mentioned having meat in it and was in the shrimp section and it had ground pork. This is ithaca, you can't put surprise meat in food. Overall, they need to get their act together take out wise. Oh, and the last time I even reminded them to give me the sauce for my gyoza and when it was delivered, no sauce, again.
Spicy Asian has been making a lot of changes in their menu. They no longer offer the Japanese menu and they are making more changes to what they do offer. This probably a good thing.

As a person who has stayed in Houston for years, I have to say that I'm really disappointed by the quality of Chinese food here. What can I say? Small portion of food, overpriced, unstable quality. I wanted to give it a 2 but since no other Chinese restaurant in town is doing a better job, I'm giving a rate of 3

After this place opened, I ate there for lunch three days in a row!  The sushi is awesome.  For mysterious reasons, I have a special place in my heart for the business that was in this location formerly (CT Bento), but Spicy Asian is definitely more like the real thing.  And lucky me, the prices are still low (for now anyway!) It seemed like this place popped up almost instantly after CT Bento closed, so I didn't expect much in the way of interior changes.  But they did a nice job with the few things they did - they put in some booths, created some half walls which divides up the space nicely, and they closed off the kitchen.  It still has a long way to go atmosphere-wise, but it's an improvement so far, so hopefully they're not done now that they're open. As for the food, I can't stop ordering the crunch rolls.  And the special sushi rolls are soooo good and so well presented.  Like Bento, they have the make your own bowls with different meats/veg/sauces, and still have that super addictive bubble tea.  Lunch specials are something like $6.50 and come with either a soup or an eggroll, and white/brown/or chicken fried rice.  It's a lot of food for these crazy cheap prices!   I only hold that last star out because they really need a bigger menu - but I respect the fact that they're starting small as it will help make sure that all their ingredients are super fresh.  Let's just hope business goes well and they expand the options soon. Service has been very quick and polite despite language barriers!

Awesome as always, though like another reviewer stated not quite as good as Han Dynasty in/outside of Philly. Highly recommend the Cumin Lamb and Beef with Chili Sauce. Had sautéed pea shoots, they were so-so. #1 recommendation? Do not wear any light-colored clothing, as the red sauces will likely stain them.

It is a great place to eat delicious authentic Chinese food. Spicy boiled fish, cumin lamb and tofu hot pot which we ordered all taste so good. It did get a little too spicy and heavy on oil, and my stomach didn't feel that well the day after. The mango bubble tea was a  bit too sweet but the other flavors were all great. The service was pretty good. And the price is okay for dinner.

Great Szechuan. Reasonable prices. Much better than the average Chinese take-out spot. Worth the extra 1/2 mile drive.

Beware off delivery from this establishment.  While I though it was ordering a Kung Pao dish for ~11.25 dollars in the end my charge at delivery was +17 dollars? Clearly, tax did make up for this discrepancy so I called Spicy Asian to ask about the overcharge.  They quickly informed me that any delivery costs an additional 5 dollars, specifically given the distance I live. That's 1 mile, to put that in other terms, the distance form Spicy Asian to anywhere in downtown Ithaca (where closer are you going to delivery Walmart?).  There is no information (I searched there after on the website) about these charges, and the management offered no apologizes and was unfazed and a bit rude by my concern.  Otherwise, the food was good.  Beware ordering delivery unless you enjoy paying +150% your expected order.

So, I'm from Philly where lies Han Dynasty, which is the best spicy schezuan style chinese food I believe to be on the entire planet. Their food is seriously like crack to me. Having said that, Spicy Asian does a really nice job of the schezuan style. Although not quite as good as Han Dynasty in Philly, It certainly satisfies my craving for spicy schezuan chinese food where other chinese restaurant will simply put another pepper in your food when you ask for it to be extra spicy (not to mention its not schezuan). They also have interesting items on the menu like "black pepper fried rice" which is a nice twist to the regular fried rice you had probably gotten hundreds of times at the every day chinese food place. I read other reviews saying that the service was kinda crappy and there is certainly some truth in that. But that was just based on the fact that it was pretty damn hard to communicate with the waitress and that they tried to give me a styrofoam container for a soup like meal I had which would of spelled disaster for the ride home. I quickly pointed out to the waitress that the styrofoam was a terrible idea and that i would need a sealable container, and even that was a kinda tough idea to convey to the waitress. Nevertheless, the food is tasty, and not fake spicy even though it does seem like you're talking to a bag of rocks when you ask for something from the staff.
It is a great place to eat delicious authentic Chinese food. Spicy boiled fish, cumin lamb and tofu hot pot which we ordered all taste so good. It did get a little too spicy and heavy on oil, and my stomach didn't feel that well the day after. The mango bubble tea was a  bit too sweet but the other flavors were all great. The service was pretty good. And the price is okay for dinner.
We tried four dishes at this restaurant last night: a braised chili fish Szechuan style, clay pot beef, spinach fried with garlic, and fried rice (sorry, I really should enter the names in Chinese to be more accurate, but this would not be useful for a lot of people). All were really good, completely authentic (as in not the usual Americanized Chinese food). This is probably your best bet for real Chinese food in Ithaca, if you are from Asia.
Great Szechuan. Reasonable prices. Much better than the average Chinese take-out spot. Worth the extra 1/2 mile drive.
This is the only good Chinese food in Ithaca. Please go and support, otherwise we will lose even this! I had a seafood hotpot, which was delicious. The fish cake was delicious. I like the peanuts at the beginning of the meal. The eggplant was good; somewhat oversauced but not as bad as the Chinese places elsewhere in Ithaca. I didn't try the Szechuan specialties. I don't personally like it that spicy.
Beware off delivery from this establishment.  While I though it was ordering a Kung Pao dish for ~11.25 dollars in the end my charge at delivery was +17 dollars? Clearly, tax did make up for this discrepancy so I called Spicy Asian to ask about the overcharge.  They quickly informed me that any delivery costs an additional 5 dollars, specifically given the distance I live. That's 1 mile, to put that in other terms, the distance form Spicy Asian to anywhere in downtown Ithaca (where closer are you going to delivery Walmart?).  There is no information (I searched there after on the website) about these charges, and the management offered no apologizes and was unfazed and a bit rude by my concern.  Otherwise, the food was good.  Beware ordering delivery unless you enjoy paying +150% your expected order.
Food is relatively authentic compared to all other chinese restaurants in the town. Each portion is small compared to the price they are charging. Service was just ok.
So, I'm from Philly where lies Han Dynasty, which is the best spicy schezuan style chinese food I believe to be on the entire planet. Their food is seriously like crack to me. Having said that, Spicy Asian does a really nice job of the schezuan style. Although not quite as good as Han Dynasty in Philly, It certainly satisfies my craving for spicy schezuan chinese food where other chinese restaurant will simply put another pepper in your food when you ask for it to be extra spicy (not to mention its not schezuan). They also have interesting items on the menu like "black pepper fried rice" which is a nice twist to the regular fried rice you had probably gotten hundreds of times at the every day chinese food place. I read other reviews saying that the service was kinda crappy and there is certainly some truth in that. But that was just based on the fact that it was pretty damn hard to communicate with the waitress and that they tried to give me a styrofoam container for a soup like meal I had which would of spelled disaster for the ride home. I quickly pointed out to the waitress that the styrofoam was a terrible idea and that i would need a sealable container, and even that was a kinda tough idea to convey to the waitress. Nevertheless, the food is tasty, and not fake spicy even though it does seem like you're talking to a bag of rocks when you ask for something from the staff.
Disclaimer: I love spicy food. The kung pao chicken from this place was off the charts hot and I have to say after a week of non ethnic food while traveling it was a great change.  Also the dumplings were meaty and tasty, and the stir fried bok Choi was really well done. I was pleasantly surprised and have to say that I absolutely loved this place!
We tried four dishes at this restaurant last night: a braised chili fish Szechuan style, clay pot beef, spinach fried with garlic, and fried rice (sorry, I really should enter the names in Chinese to be more accurate, but this would not be useful for a lot of people). All were really good, completely authentic (as in not the usual Americanized Chinese food). This is probably your best bet for real Chinese food in Ithaca, if you are from Asia.
The staf doesn't speak English .  I ordered a boba tea and all I got was tea.  The boba tea is awful

A family-run place, extremely clean.  We took other  patrons' advice and only ordered from the Szechuan part of the menu.  We had the twice cooked pork, eggplant Ma Po, and zhong dumplings. I loved the zhong dumplings!  They are stuffed with a yummy meat filling and came in a spicy chili oil sauce. The twice cook pork was good, but too salty.  I'd be willing to give it another try.  Maybe the cook just made an error and hit the entree with double the usual amount of soy sauce or something. I enjoyed the eggplant as well.  Even though it was marked on the menu as "spicy," it's a mild, subtly flavored dish I'd never had before.  A bit liquid-y with bits of meat in addition to chunks of eggplant.  Almost looked like soup, but since it was my first time trying it I don't know if that's the way it is supposed to be. Our waiter was a polite and helpful young man who was eager to answer questions.  He understood our English well, and I think his English skills are okay but he had a little trouble explaining finer points about the food in English.   Yes, one of our entrees arrived five minutes before the other, and we had to ask for a new set of plates after we finished gobbling down the dumplings, but no big deal. The other patrons were mostly Asian families--which when choosing to dine at a Chinese restaurant, I personally take as a good sign. I'll most definitely go back and try other items on the menu.

Great Chinese in Ithaca. Too bad this place wasn't here when I was a student here.  We had dumplings (standard fare) but the cumin lamb and double cooked pork were both spicy, crisp and delicious.

This is the only Szechuan restaurant at Ithaca and luckily it is a good one. They have some special spicy Chinese dishes which cannot be found at any other place nearby. Before I had to go to NYC when I miss these authentic dishes. Now it is only 10 mins away :D

First of all, don't be put off by a generic name like Spicy Asian. I used to live in southern CA where great Chinese food is plentiful. Honestly, this place is actually pretty good for Chinese food, and probably the best Chinese restaurant in Ithaca. If you are looking for real Szechuan Chinese food (not the typical Americanized dishes like General Tso's Chicken and Orange Chicken) then you should try this place. The Food: - The Cumin Lamb was amazing. One of the best I've had. I don't usually order lamb because when it's not prepared well, lamb can have a very strong odor. However, the lamb here didn't have the strong odor. It was thinly sliced, has great juicy texture, and really well flavored. - Sliced fish with sour cabbage. I thought this one was a bit too salty and greasy for my taste but the fish was pretty good. I guess typical Szechuan dishes tend to be a bit salty and greasy. Anyways, next time, I might try the steamed fish instead. - Bean Curd Home Style. This dish is listed in the Hot Pot section but I think it's a bit of a misnomer. The category is not really hot pot, but more like dishes cooked in a clay pot. Anyways, this dish came with veggies and meat. Overall, it's pretty good. It's not spicy so it's a good balance if you are ordering a lot of other spicy dishes. - Tea - I really liked their hot tea here. My Chinese friend said that it's a pretty common black tea that you have at the end of the meal. I thought it tasted a bit different from normal black tea because it has a subtle sweet after taste and really great aroma. Service: Similar to other more authentic Chinese restaurants, you should not expect great service. Come here for the food. It's not a fine dining experience. It's also usually better if you bring someone who is Chinese with you to dine here. Tips: Order the Szechuan dishes (the section of the menu where there's actual Chinese names). Please don't order pad thai or sushi here. You are better off getting those dishes at other places in Ithaca.

"It is now named Asian cuisine. I ordered egg roll, wonton soup, sweet sour chicken and chicken fried rice. Cost 28.00 w/out tip. Very little sweet sour sauce, No vegetable with this dish. The server was very busy though few customers were in the restaurant with another server helping out.  In any case it may have been an off day for them.

I was really surprise how good this place was.  I would recommend ordering for the Szechuan Style menu although the food might be on the spicier side.  I really enjoy the zhong dumplings and steamed fish with ginger and scallions.

I visited this place not longer than a week ago, and I must say this is the worst Asian place in Ithaca. I went with a good friend of mine, and we were given the poorest excuse of a table at a sit-down restaurant. The servers knew very little English and we had to resort to pointing at items in the menu. Due to their lack of English, ordering items and asking for simple things (e.g. Napkins) was unnecessarily difficult. The food was barely subpar, the pad thai was disgusting, though I can't speak for their Chinese food. My friend said the lo mein was OKAY. TL;DR The service and food here are unacceptably bad, so look elsewhere for good Asian food (e.g. Sumo, Sushi O Sake, Four Seasons, etc.)

I was not impressed during my first visit to Spicy Asian. I'm surprised it has a "4" rating on Yelp because the food had little spice or flavor.  I had the Szechuan chicken and the sauce was mediocre and despite labeled with a chili pepper was not hot at all.  The spring rolls and the egg rolls were not tasty.  Someone in my party ordered the steamed potstickers and those and its sauce were well prepared and tasty.  The orange chicken was more deepfried breading than chicken and the sauce had a slight orangy taste but didn't blow me away.  The service was good and there is plenty of seating and the ambiance is decent.  They don't sell wine or beer.

Dishes of Note on the Sichuan Menu Peashoots (called PeaSprouts on the menu I think) Dry Green Beans Spicy Double Cooked Pork Kung Pao Chicken Sichuan Style (Completely different from normal Kung Pao) Cumin Lamb Mongolian Beef (Yah kinda good despite not being Sichuan at all) But please please please Spicy Asian, hire more servers for dinner!

Spicy Asian is good if you want standard take-out, but can't decide what kind of Asian food you want. We stopped there for take-out because it was the only place open past 9pm on New Year's Day. I had pad thai; it was good enough for it to be called pad thai, but a little weak. My friend got sesame chicken, which was pretty standard take-out sesame chicken. I'd get take-out from here again, but the food wasn't good enough that I'd want a sit-down meal. With that being said, the restaurant decor would have been very nice for a sit-down meal.

Been here twice. Food has been excellent but the service has been pretty bad. We're given a minute to order and when we weren't ready, we waited 15 more before we waitress' attention. Then we asked for 3 waters after that and never got them until asking again 10 mins after that.
We order take out from Spicy Asian at least once a week. It's hands-down the best Chinese food in Ithaca, especially if you're partial to Sichuan cuisine.  Our favorites are: Shredded Pork in Garlic Sauce, Kung Pao Chicken, Cumin Lamb, Mapo Tofu, and Sichuan-Style Eggplant.  The price is very reasonable too!
Spicy Asian really impressed me with its Szechuan-style food.  To the best of my knowledge, no other restaurant in town serves this style of food.  Its not my favorite asian food in town, but its very unique and very tasty.  Service was also very good, the decor is nice, and portions are reasonably sized.  However, I did have a few issues with the restaurant.  The Menu is pretty dense and prices are a bit higher than expected for the type of food and location.  Despite these minor issues, the quality of the food makes it highly recommended in my book.
One of the best Chinese restaurant I've tried ever.  If u love chinese food and u r in  ithaca,  this is it.
I've tried several Chinese restaurants in Ithaca, and this one was the best by far if you're looking for something more authentic. The eggplant is delicious, and they'll accommodate requests if they can. (It helps if you can ask in Chinese.) Reasonably priced and a fairly wide variety of Sichuan and other types of dishes.

I am from an area where there is plenty of good chinese food, so when I arrived in Ithaca for College, I was very disappointed at the offerings.  However this place is as good as anywhere I have found.   I have only had the General Tso's but its very good, big pieces of chicken and a sauce that isnt too sugary or syrupy.  Plus the Chicken Friend rice comes with very good pieces of chicken, not just some small little cubes like some places.  While this is still not as good as some of the places back home, it is very good and they will be getting my business from now on.
