It's the best studio in town. Tory and her team offer a yoga practice that is both demanding and rejuvenating in an environment that is welcoming, clean and calming. My mind and body always feel better after a class here.   All of the instructors are knowledgable and always willing to answer any questions you have about the various poses.  The studio itself has great heat for power yoga and is completely spotless. I strongly endorse Blackbird.  It's one of my favorite places in Ithaca.

I brought a friend that was new to yoga down for hot yoga. And the instructer "Tory Jenis" was nothing but a drill sargent. She didnt show how to do the poses and yelled during the class "BREATH IN! BREATH OUT!" By far the worst/ most stressful class of my life. I also didnt like the vibe of the studio, people had their noses high in the air.

I've pursued many extreme fitness regimens, e.g., martial arts, p90x, mountain biking, and hot power yoga takes the prize for kicking my butt!   Tory, Jen, and Zenaib have each done it masterfully!  Been to other studios, but none combine quality, cleanliness, community commitment, inexpensive classes, and easy access better than Blackbird. Lastly, for an extra special butt kicking, try paddleboard yoga. Tory is Ithaca's first and only instructor. It's a serious challenge, but awesome to plunk in the water when you get hot.

A new and growing woman-owned pilates and yoga studio.  Excellent, highly trained staff and an ever-expanding class offering.

This is a great place for yoga.  The facility is super clean and staff is very friendly.  It was my first time ever doing yoga and Tory made me feel very comfortable while I contort my body into positions that I didn't know even existed.  After trying it for the first time, I was completely hooked! I would highly recommend this place.

I love Blackbird!  I have been taking hot yoga classes here for the past two years.  Having sampled many yoga studios all over the US, I can say that Blackbird is my all time favorite.   The space is wonderful and I love the community.  The teachers are fantastic-- I usually take classes with Kelly and Tory.

As a 21 year college guy into weight training, I never really  considered myself a yoga person, but I attended a class here on a whim and was highly impressed. The hot yoga provided a great whole body workout, and even as a beginner (first time EVER doing yoga) it was an enjoyable and rewarding experience. Tory was a great teacher and managed to motivate while also ensuring people did not push themselves beyond their limits/comfort zones. The class was also diverse in terms of age range and gender, which was nice to see. The class made me work hard but in a good way, and left me feeling nice and relaxed at the end as it seemed to relieve a lot of muscle tension. I highly recommend Blackbird Studio to anyone, beginner or experienced, looking for a good way to work out and relieve stress and tension at the same time.

Blackbird is my favorite yoga studio in Ithaca. For experienced yogis, this IS the place to go to get a great workout. The hot yoga is actually really really hot! My favorite teachers are Tory, Kelly, and Zainab. They try to switch it up every class and keep it interesting. Go early or reserve for the 6pm classes though, they get really full. Go and check it out with their 3 for 25 intro special!

If you're looking for a great Yoga/Pilates studio- this is it! As an out of towner- I popped by to try a few classes, and the instructors are as nice as anything!  They are super helpful, making you feel welcome without drawing attention to a newbie. The studio is a bit small- the hot yoga studio inside can comfortably fit 8pp, so go early if you want a good spot.  The studio is new, clean, and organized well. I would definitely recommend this to anyone!
