I came here on the recommendation of a friend for a haircut and highlight with the stylist Rachel, and it was an excellent experience. Having recently moved to the area within the year, in my hunt for a forever salon I had had several bad experiences with a stylist who just didn't listen and wanted to use my head as a canvas for their "edgy" (Read: Impractical and plain ugly) cuts and colors. My friend assured me that Rachel excelled at listening and interpreting your hair wishes. She was right on! Rachel took upwards of 10 minutes on our consult - examining the prior color in my hair, its texture and weight, looking at pictures I had brought. She advised me in what was and wasn't practical with my thick, wavy hair. I felt valued and trusted her to give me what I wanted. I am on a tight budget, and I appreciated that she went to real trouble to ensure that my highlights would look natural as they grew out - buying me a few extra weeks. The prices were competitive with other salons in the area, a little over $100 for a cut and highlight. So, actually on the low end pricewise. It was entirely worth every penny. I couldn't be happier. I will be a client there as long as I live in Albany.
