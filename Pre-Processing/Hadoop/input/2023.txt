Normally I shy away from chain restaurants, but Texas Roadhouse is an indisputable favorite. Last week the ol' man and I went for a spontaneous dinner out and left stuffed as usual. We always get the rattlesnake bites because their cheezy, spicy goodness is a thing of wonder. How is the cheese consistently melty without separating? It is a mystery. This restaurant is packed every night of the week, so call ahead to get queued up for a table before you arrive. The mob-scene there at 6p.m. is no wonder: dinners at Texas Roadhouse are always prepared exceptionally and the service is always stellar. The chili is a must-have. I usually order the sirloin tips because they come with mushrooms and gravy, no extra cost. I also suggest you have exactly one (1) margarita with your meal.
Love it here! The portions are perfect, it's not expensive, and all of the food is very delicious! I got grilled BBQ chicken and my sides were Cesar salad and steak fries. I LOVE the bread that they give you, they are like hot rolls and cinnamon butter on the side. It's amazing. Oh and there was a woman face painting and a man going around and making animal shaped balloons! It was so much fun! I felt like a child again :)
I won't waste your time on a long review. It's a large place with Nascar propaganda hanging on the walls and country music playing away. But...the steak is consistently excellent. Always tender and juicy and cooked to the utmost perfection. The quantity of food is very generous. The sweet rolls are delicious and they keep bringing them. There is an endless supply of free peanuts. Typically this isn't a place I would expect to go to for a fantastic steak cooked by college students. However, it's been good for years and the prices reflect quality and quantity. The wait staff is always friendly and accommodating. I recently visited with a party of ten and everything came out perfect and quickly and the waitress was in good spirits the entire time. Also, if you bring someone there on their birthday they get to sit on the birthday saddle while the wait staff sings them happy birthday. I highly recommend taking a drive out of the city and giving it a chance.
Steaks are always very tender. The salads are always fresh as are the rolls. The beer is always cold. The only "drawbacks" are that it is a bit noisy and the stupid screaming of the birthday greetings, plus having to hear "Cotten Eyed Joe" every half hour or so along with line dancing. I would rather eat my meal in peace. That being sad, it is still a lot of bang for your buck and the staff are always friendly and attentive.
Warm rolls with cinnamon butter, juicy steak and over portioned sides. I gained 5 pounds writing that sentence, but it was worth it!
From the other reviews on here maybe we had an off night. We stopped at a Texas Roadhouse in Maryland and the food was great. So we decided to try this one. The staff and waitress were great. Beer was ice cold. That's the two stars. I ordered the prime rib. It was cold, tough and probably the worst I've ever had. My wife said it tasted like a ham steak. Her dinner was very sub par also. Very disappointing. We won't be back.
This place is really good!!!  ok first if you like steak or prime rib your in luck.  You can even pick out the steak you want them to cook  for you.  i have been to this place several times and have yet to be disappointed in the food.  they  make sure when your food arrives that your steak is to your liking and if you have everything you need to enjoy your food.  its not pricey at all and they  have early bird specials were to can dine for about 16.00 dollars.  they also have homemade yeast rolls  with cinnamon butter yum yum yum.  and  ribs, chicken, salmon and shrimp, check this place out reasonably priced and you will be back.  also if you like to watch sports they have screen TVs through out so we can watch our home team bills.
I love this place! They brought us some bread once we seated: it was delicious! Warm and very tasty! Each table has a basket full with peanuts so you can eat them while waiting for your food. Both my husband's and my steak were perfectly cooked. Everything was perfect! 5 stars, no doubt!
I went on a Saturday afternoon; it was packed but my friend and I only waited 5 minutes before we were seated. There's a HUGE barrel of peanuts by the waiting area for customers to snack on while they wait. The only downside about this are the peanut shells that litter the floor around the barrel. Before we got seated, we were asked if we wanted to pick out a steak. We opted out but I definitely will next time. Once seated, we found a small bucket of peanuts at our table and complimentary appetizers, hot biscuits with cinnamon butter, were placed on our table. People, Texas Roadhouse's hot biscuits + cinnamon butter = HEAVEN. Our waiter showed up and asked if we had been there before. I said I hadn't and he surprisingly did not throw out the regurgitated shpiel about the restaurants' popular dishes, how long they've been around, blah blah, cue my eyes glazing over. Texas Roadhouse has a section on their menu called "Fall-Off-the-Bone Ribs" and our waiter commented on how the meat is so fresh and tender that it is literally falling off the bone. Maybe it was because I was sleep deprived but I thought he was really humorous!  He went on to quickly compliment their side dishes and informed us that the complimentary hot rolls with cinnamon butter are freshly made every 5 minutes. I could tell he knew what he was talking about and he was giving us genuine commentary. He kept it short and simple which I really liked. Throughout the meal,  he was attentive without being overbearing. I think almost all the entrees come with a choice of two sides. My friend and I both chose a Caesar salad for one of our sides. I had a sweet potato with brown sugar for my other side. The Caesar salad was SO good, especially for a side dish, I was pleasantly surprised. The sweet potato was equally delicious. Our waiter wasn't lying about how good their dishes are! For my entree, I ordered "Road Kill" which is a 10 ounce chopped steak smothered with sautéed onions, sautéed mushrooms and jack cheese. I got it medium rare because I always chicken out of getting rare even though that's what I really want. Next time! I was very satisfied with my steak. Usually, when I ask for medium rare, it's way too "medium." The center was a nice pink. The only con of the meal was the ginger ale I ordered. It tasted pretty diluted. Aside from that, tt was a great meal and pleasant dining experience. I seriously cannot wait to go back again.
Very impressed with the quality of service we received tonight. Our server, Brian, was friendly, helpful and on top of everything. With all the questions we asked, he was quick to answer them and knowledgable about all the food dishes. He did a wonderful job helping us celebrate my little cousins' birthday and gave her a variety of desserts to choose from which was very generous. After we left the restaurant, I realized I had left my purse outside on the bench. When I called, they had someone go outside to get it until I retrieved it. As working in the hospitality industry and studying it in school, I am very impressed. 5 stars for sure!
superb service!!! great price!! huge portions!! great magarita!!! good atmosphere!!! yummay!!! This was our 1st time there last monday. I heard its usually really busy here but we went on a monday night so there was no wait. our waitress Gina was super nice n friendly. she suggested us to order our steak medium instead of our usual medium rare since she said they do things on the raw side. so we listend to her but when it came it was too over cooked for us. She didn't give us a hard time returning it n made us a new one which was pefectly cooked juicy steak. she also gave us new hot side dishes cuz ours went cold while waitng for our new steaks. oh n if u want u can pick ur own steak like u would in a meat shop. then they will cook it the way u want it! also, they got yummy hot rolls thats served with a cinnamon butter...n yes free peanuts to snack on while u wait.... found the food to b a bit too salty towards the end of my meal...n the country music in the background is not my 1st pick...but will go again n again!
The bone in rib eye is as good as it gets for a chain restaurant.  The grilled shrimp is pretty good also. My wife had the steak salad and said it was one of the best she has had recently. Maybe add some balsamic glaze to bump it up some on the taste chart.
I used to work here so I know they have their off days but all in all TRH is something everyone has to try at least once! If you don't think they lived up to their reviews.. give them another try!
The red mashed potatoes are to die for and the steaks are perfect. Have a burger (:
This place is buzzing beyond measure. I think there was an average birthday party every 3-5 minutes. You can think of this like a little bit of Texas style, with typical wild west stuff all over. Some nice tv's and a creative system of how you can see who is next in terms of reservations. Definitely get a reservation before coming by. Food: great Service: fast Crowded: absolutely Good bar service: definitely PS: they are one of the few places that actually has a braille menu for the blind, too. I would suggest this place to anyone who likes some good meat...the vegetarian options are a little slim but good overall. As I am someone who prefers meat medium-well done, it was cooked perfect for medium well. They also have that carbicide onion flower thing which tastes great but is akin to nuclear warfare on your intestines.
Food's good. Could do with out the loud music.

For been a chain restaurant , is really good
I have been to steak houses that charge an arm and a leg ( I'm talking $55-100 a plate) and this is BY FAR my favorite place to come for a steak!! Not only can you pick your own slab of meat, if you so choose too, but it has that great Charcoal grilled taste! Their burgers also taste as tho they are cooked over a charcoal grill. They're ribs are pretty good as well. The rolls are baked fresh and come served with cinnamon butter and come to you endlessly, their sides are also homemade in the restaurant. If your looking for a good steak or something tastes that's been cooked over charcoal, at $25 dollars or less a plate,  this is the place to go .
My family and I come here a couple times a month and the food is always good and consistent. Steaks are always cooked perfect and service is always excellent!
Wow, this place rocks!  I really like how you see them baking the bread as you walk in.  Service was very good.  Menu items were reasonably priced.  Decor is texas style.  Food was very good with huge portions.  No need for an appetizer!  Ribs were the best!  They fall right off the bone.  My only complaint is the constant country music playing, lol.
Great food. Try the new fried pickles appetizer. Much better than the bloomin onion. The chef this night was cooking the meats a little light and afraid to get them to the proper doneness.
Steaks were perfectly cooked to order, incredibly juicy and very tender. Side was delicious (sweet potato). Just don't go if you want to eat low fat or low salt. My side of green beans had enough salt for my daily allotted intake. Still, you don't go there for the veggies!
Love! Love! Love this place. I've been here about 3 times now. The rolls and cinnamon butter are to die for. My boyfriend and I love their fried onion appetizer. By the time we get to our entree we are both sooo full. The last time I was there I got the BBQ chicken breast and shrimp. I wish I only got the shrimp dinner. It was AMAZING!! My baked potato was super dry though. Only down fall of the dinner.
best steak i ever had..hands down.it literally melted like butter in your mouth.great sides and a nice atmosphere...go check it out!!

First of all, yes this place is technically a chain with many locations all over the country. But, this is the only location in the Buffalo area and that makes it unique. My family and I went here together recently for a weekend lunch and it was pretty good. The rolls they give you before your meal are fresh and piping hot right out of the oven. They are served with some kind of honey butter. You also get a big bucket of peanuts which adds to that steakhouse ambiance. I've been here twice now and both times I ordered the BBQ ribs. What can I say? BBQ ribs are one of my favorite all time foods. The ribs were pretty good. They were very tender and pretty much fell right off the bone. The BBQ sauce that was used tasted pretty good to me. You get two sides with most meals and I ordered the loaded mashed potatoes and loaded fries. You can pretty much upgrade any potato option to "loaded".  With the loaded option they add cheese, butter, bacon, and sour cream. Sounds pretty awesome, right? I sampled some of the things my family members ordered as well. My mom ordered the Texas Ribeye which was okay but seemed a bit dry. My sister ordered the prime rib which tasted absolutely juicy, flavorful, and amazing to me. I think I'll order that next time. The decor of the place is like the typical steakhouse look with animal heads mounted everywhere and a lot cacti all around to give it that Texas look. Overall, a good place to grab a hearty meal.
I'm from Canada and I've been to Barberian's Steak House and The Keg. They don't compare to the consistency that I've experienced at Texas Roadhouse. In my experience, perhaps its limited, Canadian steaks just don't compare to American steaks. I experienced the Texas Roadhouse both in Watertown and then in Rochester and my girlfriend was impressed. So we decided to give the Amherst/Tonawanda location a shot. We found the steak cooked the way we wanted, medium rare. It was juicy and nicely marbled. I had the bone-in rib eye, she had the prime rib. We even ordered a small 10oz rib eye afterwards. It was just as juicy. I recommend this place 100%. Though this place is a "chain" it still provides consistent and excellent steak. I'd say my comment about this place being a "chain" is pretty much consistent with what the others have said. Don't pass up the chance to visit this place.
Ordered an 11oz. Sirloin tonight, medium rare and it was damn perfect! I hadn't eaten lunch and really wanted steak, so we used a free appetizer coupon at Texas Roadhouse. Got the cactus blossom again. Was as good as the last time. Loved the rolls, salad, and potato but ended up taking 2 potatoes home. They are so huge and with my ample slice of cow, I couldn't hardly eat any of it. But everything was better than the last time I was here, and it was all okay then. But this time, my steak was damn perfect! So I'm adding a star. And again I took advantage of the call ahead service and we had a table waiting right after we got there. Good stuff!
We've gone here several times in the last few years.  This is probably my favorite chain restaurant.  I'm not an anti-chain person but I do prefer to eat in local establishments.  However, for steak at a reasonable price, you can't beat Texas Roadhouse.  It beats the pants off places like Outback & Longhorn. Of course it is not as good as expensive steakhouses such as Buffalo Chophouse, but it doesn't have to be.  You aren't paying Chophouse prices here. First of all, the service here is excellent.  I wish all casual restaurant owners would come here to see how to properly staff a restaurant, train your staff and give outstanding service to the customer.  Once you have your table, there is NEVER any waiting around for a server.  The servers are always friendly. The steaks are always properly cooked to order, and they will ask you to cut it before they leave the table to make sure it is cooked to your liking.  I really like their side salads as well, not to mention the rolls with cinnamon butter.   I will say that the one item I was not impressed with was Prime Rib.  It had a strange processed flavor to it.  I personally am not a fan of the Prime Rib, but I've tried the filet, ribeye, sirloin and NY strip and all were excellent. If you want a very good steak dinner that doesn't cost as much as your mortgage payment, I would recommend Texas Roadhouse.
The best steakhouse in town. Ribeye is my favorite. Excellent sweeten ice tea with all you can eat bread. Great service as well.
After having heard how amazing it is, I was really let down by the food. The rolls were good but the butter didn't taste strong of cinnamon so i found it to be rather pointless. If i want a good steak i will go somewhere else in buffalo for it even if i have to pay a little bit more. The service was okay but not great, and the method of seating people made no sense don't have the buzzer go off if you aren't ready to seat me. Don't tell us to wait again because you are not ready to seat us still. Overall wouldn't go back unless everyone absolutely wanted to!
Bland food. Decent service, but there's nothing special about their food. Mostly just a waste of time.
Awesome steak and ribs. Fun atmosphere and peanuts everywhere.  Bring your entire family for a great time.
Okay.  It's a chain.   It comes complete with cheesy interior, teenage waitstaff, and fake rustic ambiance. Once you get past that, it gets better.  The food here is consistently good.  The prices are moderate and you get large portions. The only side note is that the salads are served on ice cold plates and often the lettuce is almost frozen and painful to eat.
Love me some Texas roadhouse!
My wife and I visited in mid-December, and while things started out shaky, we ended up very satisfied. The place was very busy but we were seated quickly since we called ahead. We waited for someone to take our drink orders and bring us that tasty bread everyone raves about. Then we waited some more. Eventually we flagged a server down and he said he would find our server, and in the meantime he took our drink order. Turned out that no one was assigned to our table due to some mix up. Everyone makes mistakes, I can deal with that, it's about how you try to fix it. They were very apologetic and without prompting offered us two free appetizers. Service after that was great. Refills on pop were there before I needed to ask. The food was excellent as well. I don't often go to chains due to food quality but I will go back here. Our steaks were done perfectly as well (mine medium, hers medium rare). We enjoyed the sides as well, and the prices were reasonable. Great job by the staff in turning a poor experience into a great one.
This is a great place to come with a big group of friends, love their call ahead reservation service,  makes the wait so much shorter especially when you have a large group! You get to pick your steak before you sit down if you choose to do so which is pretty cool. And can I just say I love their rolls and the cinnamon butter?!! Usually We are full by the time our main dishes come out, cause those rolls are so good, add the peanut thats on each table and the cactus blossom! I usually have like 80% of my main course coming home with me! They have great margaritas! And for the price, the portion is humongous. Oh and can I just say it one more time that I love their rolls and the cinnamon butter! So fluffy, buttery and tasty!

My husband and I discovered this place by accident coming back from our accountant's. We went on a Friday night without reservations around 6ish and the wait wasn't bad. Some notes: The bread they give you...omg if you love carbs you're going to love this bread. SOOOOOO darn good. I'm salivating thinking about it. The rest of the food was pretty good too without being too expensive at all, but that bread omg... They give you peanuts and people throw the shells on the floor. Its that kind of restaurant. Eww yeah it did gross me out too, and being allergic to peanuts, not so cool. But luckily the food and service made up for it. This place is a big eater, meat loving, peanut chucking kind of place, not good for people on diets or salad eaters. I'd go here again.

One of our favorite places to eat at a good price. Lots and lots of peanuts. We usually do the 8.99 special on weekday evenings or on Sunday afternoon. So far we have never ben disappointed. Once the waiter felt we weren't pleased with what we had received and immediately sent the manager over to make sure everything was ok. That was greatly appreciated.
The best steakhouse in town. Ribeye is my favorite. Excellent sweeten ice tea with all you can eat bread. Great service as well.
Really good steak (especially for a chain restaurant)!! I was  surprised at the quality and service here. It was actually cooked as I asked for. There was a wait for seating but to be expected for a place with good food. Peanuts on the floor are an interesting touch. I will come here again most definitely!!!
Bland food. Decent service, but there's nothing special about their food. Mostly just a waste of time.
Not a huge fan of chain restaurants but this is a good one....One thing they have that is neat is that you can pick you own steak....Yepp they have all these different steaks in a glass case and you pick which one you want.....If you are picky like me and don't like fat or grizzle then this is for you..... I have always gotten their strip steak which is my favorite and I have yet to be disappointed.... The green beans are phenomenal imo.....hey come with bacon pieces and have vinegar in them as well and are just delicious.... The baked potatoes are large, and good as well...I suggest getting the loaded ! Last time we were here we tried the rattle snake bites....Jalapeno/cheese bits lightly breaded and fried....They come with a cajun horseradish dip that is super good as well.... Oh, and don't eat all the delicious rolls and sweet butter they give you either !

We don't usually like chains, but this place is amazing at what it does. We walked in starving and were seated with a basket of warm homemade bread and cinnamon butter. The peanuts were already on the table. We ordered a couple of frozen margaritas and took a look at the menu. The margaritas are very good, and you can get a smaller version during happy hour for $3 (I think). We have never been disappointed with what we have ordered here. The ribs are tender and juicy; the barbecue sauce is sweet and spicy. You can choose your own hand-cut steak from the display case. The pulled pork is just the way we like it-broken up a bit into chunks (not shredded). Tip: They offer eight or so dinners for $7.99 before 6pm! The service here is as good as it gets. On our first visit, the manager gave us a coupon for a free appetizer for our next visit. The restaurant is family friendly! The loud country music drowns out screaming children. Crayons and coloring books are available in a large barrel when you walk through the door. They have cups with lids for kids, highchairs, and spacious booths. This is probably not the best choice if you are vegetarian or on a diet.
This place is a freaking meat lovers dream.  As my brother and I were being seated the hostess asked if we wanted to pick out our own steak; it was like a butcher shop as you were coming in!  We declined since we had never been before but were impressed with the cuts of meat. For an appetizer they give you these fresh, hot rolls with a sweet honey butter.  Ugh.  So good!  I decided to get the prime rib (12 oz, against my better judgment) and my brother got the bone in 22 oz ribeye.  Between that and the massive baked potato and salad, I was completely done in.  And the flavor!  My god, everything was just superb. I swear, I was in a protein coma all night.  I've never devoured an entire prime rib in one sitting, AND had some everything else.  Needless to say I ate only oatmeal and had a ridiculous amount of water the next day. So, if you want good meat, good service, and pretty good prices, you'll be welcome here.  Just be prepared to groan all night with a full tummy.
My wife and I visited in mid-December, and while things started out shaky, we ended up very satisfied. The place was very busy but we were seated quickly since we called ahead. We waited for someone to take our drink orders and bring us that tasty bread everyone raves about. Then we waited some more. Eventually we flagged a server down and he said he would find our server, and in the meantime he took our drink order. Turned out that no one was assigned to our table due to some mix up. Everyone makes mistakes, I can deal with that, it's about how you try to fix it. They were very apologetic and without prompting offered us two free appetizers. Service after that was great. Refills on pop were there before I needed to ask. The food was excellent as well. I don't often go to chains due to food quality but I will go back here. Our steaks were done perfectly as well (mine medium, hers medium rare). We enjoyed the sides as well, and the prices were reasonable. Great job by the staff in turning a poor experience into a great one.
Awesome place, great atmosphere. Free peanuts while you wait. Very organized. Even though it may be busy, there are those remote light up coasters that let you know when you've got seats available. As soon as you order, you are offered their complimentary freshly baked bread. As they come out steaming hot, you sink your teeth into the soft bun. And it's got a hint of sweet too. I ordered the steak, medium rare; very nicely cooked. I believe each entrée comes two sides; your choice of salad, baked potato, fries and even sweet potato surprise! Once in a while they'll do an entertaining square dance? Oh and they have a juke box where you can select songs and it will queue on the restaurant's stereo system. Food's great, great value for the price you pay and will recommend to all my friends.
This is a great place to come with a big group of friends, love their call ahead reservation service,  makes the wait so much shorter especially when you have a large group! You get to pick your steak before you sit down if you choose to do so which is pretty cool. And can I just say I love their rolls and the cinnamon butter?!! Usually We are full by the time our main dishes come out, cause those rolls are so good, add the peanut thats on each table and the cactus blossom! I usually have like 80% of my main course coming home with me! They have great margaritas! And for the price, the portion is humongous. Oh and can I just say it one more time that I love their rolls and the cinnamon butter! So fluffy, buttery and tasty!
I've been here several times before and the food is always good but today I chose the Bone-in-Ribeye and I'm not sure why I haven't before. I have no fat on my plate at the end of the meal and I have food to take home. I asked for medium and it was nicely done with pink in the center. We ate at the bar because it was New Year's Eve and a bit busy and the bartender was very personable. This was a very enjoyable way to ring in the new year.
My husband and I discovered this place by accident coming back from our accountant's. We went on a Friday night without reservations around 6ish and the wait wasn't bad. Some notes: The bread they give you...omg if you love carbs you're going to love this bread. SOOOOOO darn good. I'm salivating thinking about it. The rest of the food was pretty good too without being too expensive at all, but that bread omg... They give you peanuts and people throw the shells on the floor. Its that kind of restaurant. Eww yeah it did gross me out too, and being allergic to peanuts, not so cool. But luckily the food and service made up for it. This place is a big eater, meat loving, peanut chucking kind of place, not good for people on diets or salad eaters. I'd go here again.
I personally dont like it....i didnt get the steak i chose from the meat case and it tasted "off". Gave me a stomach ache for 2 days after. Everyone i know loves this place but i dont
One of our favorite places to eat at a good price. Lots and lots of peanuts. We usually do the 8.99 special on weekday evenings or on Sunday afternoon. So far we have never ben disappointed. Once the waiter felt we weren't pleased with what we had received and immediately sent the manager over to make sure everything was ok. That was greatly appreciated.
I don't know if the raving reviews for this place got my hopes up, but we were pretty disappointed with our visit. We walked in on a Friday night around 7:30pm expecting a wait, which took about 25 minutes. It was packed when we arrived but had thinned out considerably by the time we were leaving. Ambiance - Cool place with a definite cowboy theme. I liked that, the place was cozy but rowdy and has a warm feeling inside, with lots of wood and warm lighting. The 2-person booths, though, are waaaay too small considering they put about 3 square feet of stuff on a 4 square foot table before you've even ordered your drinks (a big block of wood with all your sauces, spices, and menus, your rolls, 2 buckets for peanuts, and 2 small plates. Seriously, there's no room left). The place itself is quite large but is broken up nicely so you never feel like you're sitting in a banquet hall. Service - Boo. Our waitress, while very friendly, was much more concerned with chatting with her friends than checking on our table. We waited a very, very long time for her to come back to the table after delivering our food. Other tables seemed to be getting better luck, though. Food - just okay. Hubby's steak was chewy and completely unseasoned, and my portobello chicken had a gravy on it that, despite their claims to make everything from scratch, still seemed like it was packaged (and was super salty). The chicken itself also had the feeling of having been pre-prepared (more salt). My corn-on-the-cob came as corn-from-a-can in a bowl, the baked sweet potatoes were severely over baked, and the appetizers we had were also way too salty. Throw the peanuts on top of all this salt and I get the feeling they're trying to get me to keep drinking. Our leftovers stayed at the restaurant. But man, those yeast rolls are delicious!!!! The website does not offer nutrition information and I was surprised to read that they make everything from scratch, because not much of what I tasted seemed that way. I would at least like to see what's in the food but they claim they're "protecting their secrets." All in all it wasn't the best experience. The prices were reasonable but after having tasted the food it was clear that you're getting what you pay for. I would consider returning for some drinks and peanuts at the bar, but I don't think I would waste my money on the dinners anymore.
Really good steak (especially for a chain restaurant)!! I was  surprised at the quality and service here. It was actually cooked as I asked for. There was a wait for seating but to be expected for a place with good food. Peanuts on the floor are an interesting touch. I will come here again most definitely!!!
Food here is always delicious, if you get the right meal. The one thing I didn't like here was the seasoned rice side dish. It just had an awful taste. On account of all the other mouth-watering food here, I think many people would love the rice but it just isn't for me. Although, the mashed potatoes were really good with the outstanding Country Fried Chicken. This is a great meal especially for picky kids/teenagers. The gravy was also delicious. I highly recommend eating here.
Not a huge fan of chain restaurants but this is a good one....One thing they have that is neat is that you can pick you own steak....Yepp they have all these different steaks in a glass case and you pick which one you want.....If you are picky like me and don't like fat or grizzle then this is for you..... I have always gotten their strip steak which is my favorite and I have yet to be disappointed.... The green beans are phenomenal imo.....hey come with bacon pieces and have vinegar in them as well and are just delicious.... The baked potatoes are large, and good as well...I suggest getting the loaded ! Last time we were here we tried the rattle snake bites....Jalapeno/cheese bits lightly breaded and fried....They come with a cajun horseradish dip that is super good as well.... Oh, and don't eat all the delicious rolls and sweet butter they give you either !
Love it here! The portions are perfect, it's not expensive, and all of the food is very delicious! I got grilled BBQ chicken and my sides were Cesar salad and steak fries. I LOVE the bread that they give you, they are like hot rolls and cinnamon butter on the side. It's amazing. Oh and there was a woman face painting and a man going around and making animal shaped balloons! It was so much fun! I felt like a child again :)
We don't usually like chains, but this place is amazing at what it does. We walked in starving and were seated with a basket of warm homemade bread and cinnamon butter. The peanuts were already on the table. We ordered a couple of frozen margaritas and took a look at the menu. The margaritas are very good, and you can get a smaller version during happy hour for $3 (I think). We have never been disappointed with what we have ordered here. The ribs are tender and juicy; the barbecue sauce is sweet and spicy. You can choose your own hand-cut steak from the display case. The pulled pork is just the way we like it-broken up a bit into chunks (not shredded). Tip: They offer eight or so dinners for $7.99 before 6pm! The service here is as good as it gets. On our first visit, the manager gave us a coupon for a free appetizer for our next visit. The restaurant is family friendly! The loud country music drowns out screaming children. Crayons and coloring books are available in a large barrel when you walk through the door. They have cups with lids for kids, highchairs, and spacious booths. This is probably not the best choice if you are vegetarian or on a diet.
Steaks are always very tender. The salads are always fresh as are the rolls. The beer is always cold. The only "drawbacks" are that it is a bit noisy and the stupid screaming of the birthday greetings, plus having to hear "Cotten Eyed Joe" every half hour or so along with line dancing. I would rather eat my meal in peace. That being sad, it is still a lot of bang for your buck and the staff are always friendly and attentive.

From the other reviews on here maybe we had an off night. We stopped at a Texas Roadhouse in Maryland and the food was great. So we decided to try this one. The staff and waitress were great. Beer was ice cold. That's the two stars. I ordered the prime rib. It was cold, tough and probably the worst I've ever had. My wife said it tasted like a ham steak. Her dinner was very sub par also. Very disappointing. We won't be back.

I love this place! They brought us some bread once we seated: it was delicious! Warm and very tasty! Each table has a basket full with peanuts so you can eat them while waiting for your food. Both my husband's and my steak were perfectly cooked. Everything was perfect! 5 stars, no doubt!

Very impressed with the quality of service we received tonight. Our server, Brian, was friendly, helpful and on top of everything. With all the questions we asked, he was quick to answer them and knowledgable about all the food dishes. He did a wonderful job helping us celebrate my little cousins' birthday and gave her a variety of desserts to choose from which was very generous. After we left the restaurant, I realized I had left my purse outside on the bench. When I called, they had someone go outside to get it until I retrieved it. As working in the hospitality industry and studying it in school, I am very impressed. 5 stars for sure!
I personally dont like it....i didnt get the steak i chose from the meat case and it tasted "off". Gave me a stomach ache for 2 days after. Everyone i know loves this place but i dont
The bone in rib eye is as good as it gets for a chain restaurant.  The grilled shrimp is pretty good also. My wife had the steak salad and said it was one of the best she has had recently. Maybe add some balsamic glaze to bump it up some on the taste chart.

This place is buzzing beyond measure. I think there was an average birthday party every 3-5 minutes. You can think of this like a little bit of Texas style, with typical wild west stuff all over. Some nice tv's and a creative system of how you can see who is next in terms of reservations. Definitely get a reservation before coming by. Food: great Service: fast Crowded: absolutely Good bar service: definitely PS: they are one of the few places that actually has a braille menu for the blind, too. I would suggest this place to anyone who likes some good meat...the vegetarian options are a little slim but good overall. As I am someone who prefers meat medium-well done, it was cooked perfect for medium well. They also have that carbicide onion flower thing which tastes great but is akin to nuclear warfare on your intestines.
Food here is always delicious, if you get the right meal. The one thing I didn't like here was the seasoned rice side dish. It just had an awful taste.
