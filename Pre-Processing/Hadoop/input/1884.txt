I went to Alex's this past weekend for brunch.  I suspect that like many downtown areas, Poughkeepsie is dead on the weekends and I was delighted to find such a quaint little place to nurse the epic and otherworldly hangover I was enduring.  The food was excellent and though a little slow, the service was very friendly and very competent.
This is a gem in the heart of Poughkeepsie. They're not open for dinner, but I wish they were! We've had great breakfasts and lunches here and have never been disappointed. The wait staff is great - the owner is wonderful -- and the entire dinning experience is just wonderful.
Everything that I have ever eaten here over the years has been delicious. I've been working in poughkeepsie for the past five years and can not remember a subpar meal here.  Not too expensive, really clean and a nice place to sit inside or eat outside too. The chicken nachos are my favorite; loaded with fresh sliced grilled chicken, veggies, cheese and it's a huge portion. Big enough to take home or share.
When I walked into this restaurant for breakfast, it was already packed. Good quality coffee, food was served faster than other restaurants. When I wanted another refill of coffee, the waitress passed me with the jug of coffee in her hand, i had to ask for another one instead of them asking me if i wanted another refill. The food is alright, the butter is actually not frozen solid! Other than that, it was worth coming back.
After celebrating the #JavalySmithWedding the night before in Poughkeepsie and staying at a local hotel, a friend said he wanted an omelette and coffee and suggested we go to Alex's because it was nearby. After conferring with the hotel receptionist, Alex's had her seal of approval, so friends and I went there for brunch. The menu has a wide array of breakfast and lunch options, and there's definitely something for everyone. We started with a hummus plate, which had plenty of hummus for the party of five, though not many pita triangles. It also came with saltines, for some reason. I then ordered the "Avocado, Pesto" panini for my meal and it was fantastic. They didn't skimp on the avocado or sliced black olives, while the roasted red pepper provided a nice foundation. Good bread choice, too, with the focaccia. Prices were very reasonable and service was good. All in all, I'd go again, if I was in the area. And as for my friend from the introduction? I believe he got the coffee, but he did not get the omelette. He got a Greek salad, which looked pretty good.
Only came in here because I had some time to kill waiting for a bus, and I don't think I could have made a better choice! This charming little bistro on the corner is run by all of the friendliest people known to man, and has outstanding food. I got the beef barley soup as a side to my tuna melt panini, which were both so great, and the older lady working there seems like she's probably the owner? Yet, she still runs around, taking orders, bringing out food, keeping it clean, and everything. She was awesome. And the Black Cow I had was absolutely phenomenal. I've never had a better ice cream soda in my life. Haha I mean that-it's mind-blowing. Definitely worth checking out.
The food here has always been solid. Diner food but done fancy and fresh and right! I'm a big fan of their breakfast menu, and my brother loves their burgers. I definitely recommend it to all y'all, with one exception... Don't go here if you have anywhere to be anytime soon. I've been here during the lunch rush. I've been here when it's dead. I've been here during the week. On the weekend. And the service is always soooooo daaaaaaamn slooooooow. To the point that it's kinda ridiculous. Very friendly staff but you'll wait forever to get your order taken, forever for the food, and forever to get your check. Last time I was there I considered just walking out and standing next to the window with my bill and my money in my hand ready to pay if/when they even noticed I'd left.   But I still keep going back, so that should tell you how yummy it is! :D
Nicest place in Poughkeepsie. Good food, great prices, lovely atmosphere. Would go again and again.
Wow, just wow. Small place, great atmosphere, and simply perfect in everyway. Best breakfast i have ever had hands downs.
Have eaten breakfast and lunch at Alex's many times and will not eat anywhere else!  Have had omelets, salads, nachos, smoothies, yogurt, bread pudding, rice pudding and pies.  Never was disappointed,  Everything fresh with large portions.  Their wait staff are excellent!
Alex's is a gem.  The eggs florentine were out of this world. The pumpkin pancakes fluffy and delicious. The service was superb and the place is clean, bright and welcoming. Will most definitely be back!
If you want alot for a little, this is the place! They have everything! Salads, breakfast, sandwiches, seafood, moussaka and dessert. All of it is fresh, tasty and unbelievably inexpensive. Ive been there during the busy lunch rush and the weekends for breakfast, no matter how busy Alex's gets, the staff is friendly, aiming to please and a real delight. this is the most busy place in the city of pok during the week and I can see why: the ambience is superb, the waitresses fast and the food awesome! The soups are my fave! And their specials are always yummy and creative! The cute blond guy behind the counter is fast and manages to give every customer his full attention. Love Alex's!
I came in today with my wife for a nice and pleasant breakfast and was not disappointed. It's a perfect little restaurant with a great ambiance, for the value and the quality of food you can not go wrong.
(04/27/2012)  Great little place in downtown Poughkeepsie to do breakfast or lunch.  Place is centrally located and highly visible; interior is bistro like and welcoming (bright and open, pressed tin ceilings, red brck floors) with windows on two sides (it sits at the corner of Main and Market).  Menu was a simple one-pager (a good sign).  My Eggs Benedict had a light lemony Hollandaise, seemed homemade (even started to break a little); side of sausges were substantial in size, plump, meaty, well bronzed, peppery and flavorful; home fries were plentiful, tender and brown, but seemed to have been fried on the flattop with some other rendered meat grease (some slightly off metallic flavors).  Mix of regulars hanging drinking coffee, reading the paper, chatting with friends; visitors stopping by for a bite; downtown suits grabbing some lunch before heading back to the office.  Food was high quality, well-prepared, reasonably priced.
A great place, great décor, friendly staff and the food is excellent. A must for for breakfast or lunch. Lots of variety when it comes to choices. They have enough to please any palate. While at first glance you may think it is a diner, after you examine the many choices that are offered on their spectacular menu, you will be pleasantly surprised.  A staple in the City of Poughkeepsie providing quality meals with great service. Do not pass up the opportunity to patronize this traditional landmark.
Been there for lunch and breakfast several times.   Awesome diner food.   Love the gyros.   The guy who runs (maybe he is the owner) is so friendly and hard working.   He treats his customers well.
Delicious!! Beautiful decor!! And not pricey at all! I had a portabella, goat cheese, red peppers, spinach wrap and it was amazing!! Also the shakes are awesome! Oh and the fries.... Perfect! Must go here, especially after a nice stroll over the walkway over the hudson. You'll need the exercise before heading in here!
Visiting a friend upstate, and I didn't have time to eat before I got on Metro North. Result: my friend picked up a very grumpy Hannah E. from the train station. We were scrolling through his GPS to find a diner, but nothing looked good. As he put in coordinates for a Dunkin Donuts, I checked my beloved Yelp and saw Alex's Restaurant (anyone else get Arlo Guthrie in their head?) It got good reviews, so I snatched the GPS and put in the address. This place is super cute. Big windows, wooden tables... it is classic small-town diner. We were sat quickly, and our waitress was friendly and efficient. The menu had lots of great options. So many, in fact, that I had did my shameful "ordering multiple meals bcs I couldn't decide" schtick (luckily, I only do this with breakfast). First, I had to get eggs florentine. Because, when it's offered, I always order eggs florentine. But, they had a breakfast wrap with poached eggs and goat cheese that sounded good. So I ordered that too. Don't worry, I split it with my friend. Both dishes were delicious. The free coffee refills kept coming. We had a great time. I just wish we had gone with more people so I could have tried more things. There were lots of awesome sounding items on the menu! Plus, they have soda fountain sodas (as in, they do a pump of syrup into seltzer), smoothies, etc. I don't know Poughkeepsie that well, but it seemed like food options might be limited. And I DO know my breakfast quite well, so with that in mind I highly recommend Alex's Restaurant!
Great place for brunch....good pace, good food, and good service. Much better than your run of the mill huge diners. Plus, you get to support downtown Poughkeepsie.
Have been back several times and each time the food is great and service is almost overly friendly. It's a fab alternative to the larger corporate feeling diners in the area and it's never mobbed. It's a more relaxed experience.
Excellent! Clean, friendly and GREAT FOOD!! DEFINITELY come here instead of the dirty diner down the block.
Had breakfast this morning and was the expected diner food. Home fries were soaked in oil, both the regular scrambled eggs that I had and the Eggs Benedict my boyfriend had were ok but lacked in flavor. The hollondaise sauce was bland and so was my sausage links with the salt-less scrambled eggs. I also had challah French Toast with my eggs and sausage, which also was mediocre. Everything just needed something to make is absolutely 4 or 5 stars. Even the coffee. However, I gave it 4 stars because of their awesome lunch that I had just last week. I had the mushroom and goat cheese panini with spinach and roasted red peppers ( I'm not exactly sure of the name of it but it's very delicious). I would definitely go back to try other lunch options. Also one more added bonus is the decor. Very cool updated old style diner. Like a place you would see Jerry Seinfeld having coffee with another comedian buddy of his. (See Comedians in Cars Drinking Coffee)
I must eat at Alex's at least 2 to 3 times a month. The staff is super friendly, and the service is fantastic. The Market Street Wrap is a home run and constant go to. LOVE the bread and rice puddings and a good cuppajoe in the mornings. I can't say enough good things about Alex's.
Having moved to the area I had driven past on several occasions but due to my work schedule never had the opportunity to experience this Gem as everyone coined it.  It wasn't until I recently got selected for Jury Duty that I was afforded the absolute pleasure of Alex's.   The people are great and the service & food are part of a local feel that is welcoming.  While walking back to my car I peeked in to ask about hours etc and was given a sample of warm freshly prepared rice pudding.  Let me tell you it reminded me of my Nana's & I'm hooked.   Truly recommended to anyone new to the area - you'll be guaranteed to make Alex's your 'diner' of choice.
Interesting assortment of tasty food to choose from. Better and cleaner and friendlier than the average restaurant. Don't miss the soda fountain items to choose from.
When I called to ask if they were busy, I got a nice reply that they were not- surprising this gem was so empty for a Saturday morning. Friendly, good portioned breakfast. A good selection of food. I had the french toast with cream cheese filling. Yum. Everyone at the table had a good looking breakfast. The yogurt parfait looked fab, almost like a sundae! I wouldn't say this place was fancy but it has character. Interesting window watching from the restaurant. i would go again and try the parfait... or something else cause it all  looks pretty good. Cute place that seems to draw locals so that is a good thing! Friendly staff and accomidating for our large group. They seemed happy to have us which isn't always the case at a small locals place.
Answering the phones, typing away at the computer, I'm thinking about what I should eat for lunch. Gyros. I'm in the mood for gyros with a Greek salad. I walk out of my office building and walk a couple blocks to Alex's. It's busy. The cashier is getting orders on the phone, through the window and up front. I give my order, get my food and head out. At my desk, the gyro tastes wonderful. Maybe next time, I'll get a burger or wrap and I won't hold back on bread pudding or apple pie.
I was very surprised when I walked in.  I was expecting typical diner boothes and greasy tables.  NOT.  Actually a very cute place.  Cozy chairs. My omelette was very good.  My friends blueberry cream cheese french toast was decadent.  Very good coffee. And the service was point on attentive.   Healthy menu options of which I passed up may be up your ally.  If you're headed to a diner this should be where you end up in this neck of the woods.
Doesn't look like the most glorious place to grab a bite, but the interior has a very nice 60s and 70s touch. Karen was very nice and made sure we didn't get charged extra. Breakfast was fantastic (I ordered the breakfast Sampler) , if I ever come back here, this is the first stop I'm making!
My girlfriend and I went here for breakfast on our anniversary and I have been here a few times previously with my mom. I love the atmosphere very comfortable and old timey, nice jazz playing and everyone was Very nice, Especially our waitress Karen. The menu is pretty big and versatile! Rachael had the GAF sandwich with feta avocado and turkey with a garlic mayo on multi-grain ciabatta- to die for! her sandwich was perfect. I had breakfast with Callah bread french toast, sausage patties and over easy eggs. Once again, Perfect. A splendid meal and we will definitely be going back as much as possible! A GEM among Poughkeepsie!
The four berry blend smoothie is a win for me. So is the breakfast that can be ordered at anytime of the day.   The layout of the restaurant is quaint and cute.
It is wonderful to see an establishment with more than a hundred years under its belt in the hands of such gracious and capable individuals. Oh, and the food is great with excellent coffee.
