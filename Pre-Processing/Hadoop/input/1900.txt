Have been meaning to come here after hearing from friends how much they like it. Finally made a trip this evening and was pleased. The food, atmosphere, and service were all very agreeable. Will be back in the future.
I can't even. I mean. oh my. YES please. We have driven past this place for years and always made fun of it thinking it's where hobos go for meetups. The sign looks old, and the location seems odd. For fun one day my partner looked the place up and lo, LOOK at all the 5 star ratings are you KIDDING? So we made it our mission to check it out and I'm so pleased we did. Walking in there it feels like an old school steakhouse, kind of tired looking but lovely linens on the tables, candlelit, fireplace in the dining room, sparkling glassware and silverware. Servers and staff in white shirts and ties, I haven't figured out yet who is what, there seems to be a maitre d' and some sort of table captain who recites the specials but doesn't take orders, etc. Someone on yelp said in their review it seemed like there was a dude who was just there to bring me more butter, I laughed but it's true, it seems that way :D My standard margarita was definitely home made, the glass it came in made me laugh, a standard wide mouthed margarita glass you still see at Mexican places but these days most bars have updated their glassware to something more contemporary. That being said, it was very good. Apps I've tried so far which have been out of this world have been the Escargots Bourguignonne - these guys are KILLER good, normally I've had them in variations of white wine and garlic, these burgundy ones are heavier, more savoury, thick and rich. The broth, I would just eat that with a spoon. Last time there I had the cajun baked oysters, just forget about calories and arteries and any sort of health altogether, they're just ridiculously fantastic. Smooth with whatever "cajun creme" is, I shed tears of sadness when I was finished because I didn't have more. Bluepoints on the halfshell is regular New England fare, the carpaccio is great, although we agreed that the Beechtree in P-town makes a better one. Still, very very good. And when was the last time you saw tableside caesar salad made up for you? Personally I prefer it a little creamier, and I'd like to see some fresh shaved parm on top but no complaints. The onion soup gratinée is again, "forget your arteries and just eat". Hope your heart attack happens after you're done, not during. Entrées - swordfish special, incredible. Sea bass, incredible. New York sirloin, perfect. They're just all done the way you always imagined a great place would make your dinner, look for mistakes, they're not there. But the reason we're going to go back, again and again and again til I keel over is the chateaubriand. I have eaten a LOT of great steaks in many restaurants in many states and countries. This chateaubriand was the best meat I have ever eaten, hands down. Dinner partner concurs. I can't even tell you, how can meat be light and yet meaty at the same time? melt in your mouth, beautifully done, tableside garnished, it's the best meat I've ever had, ever. Don't bother bringing up Ruth's Chris or Morton's, and agreed that I haven't eaten $500 kobe beef at some out of the way shi-shi place, but this is some fantastic meat they have here, if you can pony up $76 for two, you have to do it at least once just to check it out. Romantic, pampering, they crumb the table which I haven't seen since the CIA, pricey, yes, worth it, read the menu before you go so you have a better idea of what you might want, if you want to have a great dinner but not break the bank consider doing the prix-fixe or skip the appetizers, I can't wait til we go again so I can make an update. Leave the calorie counter at home. A+, nuff said. add: I should know better than to say 'nuff said because there's MORE to be said: your doggie bag leftovers, should you have any, are kindly wrapped in plastic instead of just being chucked into a container, so they actually stay edible - and that chateaubriand was still like tiny angels dancing a polka in my mouth even microwaved a day later.
This the place to go for a special occassion. Doesn't get better! There is an old warm charm that is matched by wait staff who are mature and experienced, setting this restaurant apart  from the chains. And the food is excellent. My filet mignon was so tender and flavorful and the mashed potatos and asparagus were very good accompaniments. I enjoyed the salad as well as the french onion soup. Even though I was thoroughly full I "forced" myself to have dessert: profiterole, which was very satisfying. Will return.
Wonderful food and service! We took our daughter to celebrate her first college acceptance. She loved the vegetarian risotto and delicious bananas foster. Steaks were done perfectly and my pappardelle with shrimp & Roma tomatoes was excellent. Our son wore a bow tie and tuxedo and was mistaken for a busboy and told to use the bathroom in the basement by the owner. Once the owner learned he was a patron we were offered after dinner drinks to make it up to us. We were only having coffee but we all got a good laugh. Wonderful place and I'd definitely go back! They know how to treat you right!
I am so having one of those Yelp dilemma moments about Ship Lantern. 3 stars? 4 stars? I can't possibly say 5, can I? This place is a total time warp. It is as old school a restaurant as you will find - right down to the octogenarian waitstaff in their penguin suits. The newest material the guitar player performed was Elvis (and not Costello.) Still, these dudes are totally pro (which stands to reason, given all the experience they have!) The food is actually quite good. The experience is, um, well...unique. You should go though. Have an extra drink and just marvel at your surroundings a bit. Have fun with it. A completely different kind of "fine dining" experience from what most of us have become accustomed to -- but still, worth the trip.
I was in the Poughkeespie area visting this week and had the fortune of dining at the Ship Lantern Inn. What a nice place to enjoy a meal! We went for the early bird special....felt like i was with the Seinfelds. Its a fixed menu 4:00- 6:00 Tuesday--Friday with plenty to choose from.Plus they have the non twilight menu. l had the fillet medium. What a great tasting cut of meat. I also had the french onion soup and a nice salad, plus a nice chocolate tart to finish the meal off! I really enjoyed the old school atmosphere...guys working front of the house all in black suits, very attentive with water, drinks. Plus they crumb the table when is the last time you saw that? Plus the building dates back to  Revolutionary War days!
FRUIT FLIES!! GNATS!! STINK BUGS OH MY!!!!! The LANTERN INN EXPERIENCE WAS A SHIPWRECK ACROSS THE BOARD OVERPRICED , BUG PROBLEM, MANAGEMENT RUDE TO THE STAFF I was so excited to eat here and heard some "good" things. I got a sitter ,.. Told the wife get dolled up,... And headed to a nice night out for dinner. We were greeted by owner/ pseudo broad walk empire gangster who was pushing cocktails from the second we walked in. This guy had s short fuse and the staff wore their emotions on thier sleeves,... They were walking on egg shells around this goon. THE GOOD the food was better than average.. LIVE MUSIC!+++ the gentleman playing guitar and singing was excellent That's about the jist of it THE BAD Overpriced for what we ate .. $70 s head for two with apps & main .. No drinks didn't stay for desert . THE UGLY I know there is some underlying nautical theme of sorts ,.. But it's mostly dark wood paneling and tacky ships in bottles , the wood was shining !! But you can put a silk suit on a pig ... THE UGLY INSECTS/BUGS are inevitable in food service industry but DE-NILE is not just a river in Egypt ,.. Noticed gnats hovering during apps,.. The became a nuisance in between salad and main course. Than the "stink bugs",.. On my wife's bag , the windows ceiling & windows I asked are server if we could move our table bc of all these bugs... His response was let me ask the boss? This elderly male server was belittled by the owner ,.. As if he was lying or we we imagining his pest problem Never addressed ! He actually had the balls to come over with a smile and ask us if we needed more drinks!!??? We drove to a diner for coffee and desert
Exceptional Staff, Great Atmosphere, the food is pleasing to the eye and Pallet. A wonderful experience all around!
Wow, really?  Everyone else here must have gone to a different Ship Lantern Inn than I did because they just blew it on every level.  I give it 2 stars because the decor was really nice.  A beautiful place really, but everything else was just sub par. First off, we ordered what was described to us as an heirloom tomato caprese salad... what arrived was a regular tomato caprese salad.  Despite my appearance, I can assure you I know the difference between the two.  What came next was the saddest old lettuce salad I've ever eaten, followed by the Cioppino which we ordered as the main.  It was very over cooked, to the point where the lobster meat was just tough.  The servers also didnt seem to care much for us either.  This great service that everyone is talking about was missing. This was a very expensive waste of a meal.  Oh the bread was good... I'll give them that.
I have been coming to this restaurant for last 40 years, but have not been back for last ten; guess what? Still outstanding! First class in every category, same family runs it, and unlike a lot of places over the years that try to change to adjust to whatever; this restaurant is like time stood still in every good way (except cost for a meal; of course).
I have NEVER given any business a 5 star rating... until NOW! The Ship Lantern Inn is the definition of EXTRAORDINARY service.  I am talking about the service first because I have not experienced this level of service in ANY restaurant, ever.  (I have dined in amazing 4 star restaurants, and although I have experienced WONDERFUL service, this place was by far the best.)   This restaurant should write the book on restaurant service. Of course the food deserves 5 stars as well! I have been there three times over the last 2 years, most recently this past Saturday evening.   This was the first time we have come specifically for the early bird special.  It's a prix-fix dinner from 4-6PM on Saturday evening.  We arrived at 5:30 (with a reservation - which is definitely necessary for Saturday night), and were shown to our table immediately, as always.  The fireplace was crackling, and there was live music in the form of a guitarist singing old classics.  The volume was perfect for this restaurant, and he was pretty darn amazing as well. We were given both menus as well as the wine list.   Let me stop for a moment and say that tables are set beautifully - with candles and fresh flowers.  My favorite part of the table setting, however, is the small bowl of sun-dried tomato tapenade to go with wonderful crusty bread.  I finally asked for the recipe, and it sounds so simple, yet it is so sublime!!! Anyway, on to the actual food.... The prix-fix dinner (which is $27.50) starts with either a flute of champagne or a Kir Royal.  I had the Kir Royale, and it was a lovely way to start the evening. We chose our appetizers and entrees, and then ordered a bottle of wine for dinner. The wine list has some very reasonable (about $30-$35) bottles which are very respectable and wonderfully drinkable. Although there is a limited menu for the prix-fix, we still lamented over which items to try - they ALL sounded amazing. I ordered the shrimp with tomato and basil appetizer, and it was delicious.  I was a bit concerned about the possibility of getting less-than-good tomatoes, but I was clearly wrong to worry about that.  It was delicious.   Salad with raspberry vinaigrette was also good; however the two apple slices probably should have just  been left off the plate.  Hudson Valley Apples are definitely long past their prime, and that is the only even slightly negative thing I have to say.  The salad itself was delicious. I ordered the Pork Osso Buco and was pleasantly surprised by it.  I have only had Veal Osso Buso in the past, so I was wondering if this would even come close. It was absolutely wonderfully, falling-off-the-bone succulent, with an incredible risotto Milanese to accompany it.  (It was even delicious for leftovers the next day!) Dessert choices included chocolate pecan tart and profiteroles (among other things), and both of those were (once again) incredible.  Coffee was good, and a perfect end to the evening. Service throughout was attentive and pleasant, and we were never without a full glass of water or wine.   They know how to be attentive without hovering, and I absolutely love that. We will definitely be back - again and again!
Superb meal last night. ! Absolutely impeccable wait staff. They were busy so the owner joined in helping the staff. Tuna medallion app. Caesar salad.  Lobster tails. And Apple fritters with caramel icecream (it is apple country). Everything absolutely everything was perfect.
Great food, great atmosphere, the most curtious staff, extensive wine list, you just don't find a restaurant around here like this anymore.  The level of service makes you feel like you are the only patrons in the restaurant.  I could go on and on but I will just say experience this restaurant for yourself and you will find yourself going back time and time again.  Five stars is just not enough!!!
Went there yesterday for my parents 40th anniversary.  6 adults and 5 kids.  The place is very nice.  The staff is great and they know what they're doing.  BUT we went there expecting a top notch meal based on prices and what I've heard.  I had the 14 oz "aged" sirloin which was VERY tough.  Lacked flavor.  My father and brother had the fish place which came with mussels and clams and lobster tail, and that was sub par. The lobster was tough too.  My wife had the ahi tuna app which was basically a really thin slice of tuna. Not the normal seared tuna you expect, although it was good.  She also had the risotto (dinner portion) which was not a large portion but of course cost more than what was on the menu.  Honestly, the kids meals were the best thing. They had chicken fingers which were good and juicy.  Only one glass of wine ordered, and everyone else had soda or iced tea (which they charge for refills) and no dessert, yet the bill was just under $400.  I was severely disappointed and won't be going back.
This is a perfect place to have delicious meals with your family and friends
Had dinner a few weeks back, once again the food was the best, the owner saw to it our dinner experience was magical. The oyster Rockefeller is the best I have ever has in my life. Keep up the good work ship lantern staff
Everything here is 100% perfect! Love the classic feel of the place. Excellent all around!
The food was amazing. The duck was tender and savory. I would come back anytime. I would recommend this place 100xs
I arrived here for a Business Marketing Association meeting and boy did I eat! Appetizer: Antipasto Entre: Filet Mignon Dessert: Appleturnover with vanilla Ice cream It has a very nice vintage feel to it, in a ship cabin. They have a really old fireplace which gives off that crackling wood sound and it's actually very soothing when consuming my meal. I had to eat all my food, not because it was rude not to but because it was just so damn delicious it seems like a waste not to expand my stomach a little bit more to finish everything. Must go! Perfect for dates *winkwink* The waitresses were very nice, but they kept asking me if I wanted soda instead of any alcohol (they must think I'm a child).
Went here tonight for a Restaurant Week meal and it was great. It's an old school type of place, where the waiters are dressed in suits and they pull out your chair for you and place your napkin on your lap. The service was friendly and very polite. They lit a fire and the ambiance was perfect for a cold night like tonight. All the courses were brought out relatively quickly, but the place wasn't crowded at all so we didn't feel rushed. The bread was really good and it came with a tomato and garlic spread that I couldn't stop eating. My petite filet topped with blue cheese was perfectly cooked to medium and was very tender. It was served with mashed potatoes, asparagus, sauteed spinach, some sort of mushroom souffle, and apple butter. The apple butter didn't really go with the meal, but it was very tasty. My dad said his pork chop was excellent. For dessert I had the apple fritter with cinnamon pecan ice cream and a caramel sauce. It was delicious! The appetizers were enjoyable as well. I would certainly go back.
This is one of our favorite places!  Service and meals are equally perfect. Great winter dining experience with gorgeous working fireplaces. Mike the owner makes sure everything comes out of the kitchen the way it should be. We have dined here over two dozens times, and have never been disappointed
Loved the meal! The atmosphere was so awesome and different, although the music was a little bit too loud. For an appetizer I got an oyster sampler, the special for the night, and it was delicious. I got the duck with raspberry sauce. So much flavor, and so many different flavors. Got a dessert sampler, which was very classic American dessert. And it was delicious. I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great place to eat!
I thought i was being kidnapped. "WHERE are you TAKING ME!?" that's pretty much what i started asking in growing fear as we drove through quiet & deserted roads in the middle of the night towards (apparently) Ship Lantern Inn. The neon-electric sign in red did little to ease my discomfort as I saw it from the road, and neither did the white house sitting far away atop the hill. But as we drove up top, the parking lot was full and apppaaaarently, this restaurant frontin' as an Inn, is well known to the dining elite of the Greater NY region, and beyond. For good reason. The service was impeccable - with waiters dressed to the nines and swirling about the room. Appetizers: the graham cracker calamari & tempura lobster were dangerously addictive. I got a salad special based on the key words: fresh mozarella, hand-picked basil from our garden, and some enigmatic word that i never figured out, but something which made my salad delicious. I had a fish dish, which was amazing, but tried some of the lobster & filet mignon, also amazing. Topped it off with a special order Baked Alaska cut into the largest pieces known to man. Annnd i finished that too. Just. so. damn. good. Ship Lantern Inn: Unbelievable dining experience in the most unlikely of places.
Okay, where else can you find a restaurant with ties to Hector Boiairdi ("The" Chef-Boy-Ar-Dee)? Located on Rt 9W in Milton, NY this place is a reminder of the dining experience enjoyed 50 years ago. The Chef set up his flagship plant in Milton, PA - a plant I actually worked in for four years. Not very impressive from the road, you actually are looking at the back of the restaurant. This is the kind of place where you still see people coming to dinner dressed in something other than jeans or shorts. My wife and I fit into the informal dress code and the place was packed - remember this is in a small town north of Newburgh, NY. The menu is wonderful and it was difficult to make a choice. After enjoying a Graham Cracker Crusted Calamari appetizer (with two great dipping sauces) we settled on Diver Sea Scallops along with Veal Valdostano coupled with house salad with blue cheese. What sets the restaurant apart from the competition is the fact that you are seated in a dining room of 15 tables and two waiters. These waiters are assisted by two or three assistants and all the final prep work is done at two tables situated in the room. The wine list is extensive and prices are quite reasonable. while we did not have dessert, the menu was very tempting. The bar is cozy and nicely decorated - ship models all around. there is even a little shrine to the four founders taken on the 2nd anniversary, along with 3 cans of canned product The chances of us getting back to this area are slim, but if you are ever in the area give the Ship Lantern Inn a try. this is dining the way is was a long time ago. You will not be disappointed
What a great place - even though it's right off of a fairly major road (in the small town of Milton, NY), you probably would just stop here, but you'd be missing out. The Shiplantern is a 3rd or 4th generation owned and run Continenantal Cuisine restaurant, and everything about it is top shelf. To start, the decor is quite charming, especially if you like ship type things.  The hardwood throughout the establishment is nice, and the bar area very nicely appointed. The service - from the host to the waiters, all are dressed in tuxes, and look very formal.  Don't be alarmed though - you can wear more casual attire and still fit in.  They waiters and the host are very friendly, and some have been working there for 40 years.  You will be treated to a display, too, watching the staff prepare parts of your meal on small tables situated through the restaurant. The menu was extensive, with several great specials.  I had a Chilean Sea Bass that was fabulous, and the sides of vegetables and potatoes were quite good, too.  Jenn had the chicken special and I'll be trying the leftovers for dinner when I get home tonight - but she was happy with it. The place is full of regulars, as was made evident by the wait staff and host speaking with nearly every table, and some at length. All in all, a very traditional dining experience that is not to be missed, or forgotten. One note - Mr. Foglia (whose name is prominently displayed on the large neon sign in front of the restaurant that should in no way dissuade you from going in!) is one of the four original founders of the renowned Chef-Boy-Ar-Dee Company. Enjoy it.
This place has absolutely amazing fare and service. It is a truly fine dining experience from another era. Don't be put off by the "nautical theme"; it is done in the 1960s style and is very pleasing to the eye. The staff were extremely courteous, well dressed and well humored, attentive without being oppressive (quite particularly Carlo, who has been there for 52 years, we learned). It is well worth the trip and the views over the valley. Highly recommended and will be returning soon.
Excellent food and excellent service. Highly recommended for others. They have a $19 "twilight menu" from 4-6PM Tuesday-Friday which includes a couple appetizers, an entree, and dessert and coffee. A great experience...
