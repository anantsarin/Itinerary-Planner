Doesnt look the best from the outside but it is very nice and inviting on the inside! Great food and beer and a wonderful place to eat and watch some sports.
Diamond in the rough is right. This was the single biggest burger I've ever tried to eat and it was worth every single bite. Amazing.
I've been going to Miley's since I was a kid and have been back more recently in the last couple of years as it has become a favorite stop for my parents. I even got them a gift certificate here as part of their anniversary gift last year. Ownership has changed hands, but there have been some good changes and different types of food coming out, while still retaining the name and the casual sports bar feel. They also do quite a bit of catering. They were packing up for a party when we were there and everything looked tasty. My parents came for an early dinner once and they were hosting a fun bridal/bachelorette shower and they both said all the food they had out looked very good. The chef often comes out to ask my parents how they liked things, especially any specials they order. Firstly, this was about the only place in town that my mom and I could find that was open for a lunch time meal on a Saturday afternoon. Pretty much everything else downtown is closed for the day or doesn't open until 4. We consequently were the only ones there when we stopped by after 1pm. The run burger nights, wing nights, and other specials and parties for sports events (Olympics, SuperBowl, NCAA) They usually run a few good and different specials for lunch and dinner.  They had pulled pork, tacos, and even chili cheese dogs for Saturday lunch. Dinner items have ranged from meatball sandwich, fish specials like ahi-ahi, pasta dishes, steak, etc. I think the prices are very reasonable overall.   Menu has salads, sandwiches, pizza, and extensive flavors of wings and other "pub" food. My mom is a vegetarian and there are not a ton of options, but she does like their greek salad which comes meatless and she says their veggie burger is one of the best restaurant ones she has had (will touch on later) In the last while since I have been there, they have developed an extensive burger menu with about 30 different variations. Everything from the "Rick James" which is Buffalo sauce/bleu cheese style, to ones topped with a fried egg, or with multiple types of meat.   I had the "Doc Holliday" which was a burger with bacon, grilled onions, cheddar cheese, and BBQ sauce. Burger was cooked perfectly to medium well and was large and juicy. BBQ sauce was not industrial-sauce-out-of-a-bottle tasting, and all the flavors melded together nicely. I wouldn't hesitate to get it again. It came on a good sized Kaiser roll. Burgers and stuff come with chips with option to upgrade to fries. I like that option because the burger was plenty big enough to feed me for a late lunch. They state at the top of burger menu that no substitutions are allowed. I can understand that to a point like a busy dinner service, but I think that is a little overkill. Subtractions I think are easy enough to ask for. My mom got her normal Veggie ("Vitameatavegamin" though it was unclear to me in the description that it was veggie) burger and asked (even though knowing no subs) if she could get on Rye bread as my parents have been regulars with the same waitress in the evening and she normally gets it like that. She also wanted no mayo. The afternoon waitress, while nice, seemed hesitant, but said she would put it in. Unfortunately when it came out, it was on the white kaiser roll and had mayo. My mom decided not to eat the roll at all and I took the mayo off for my burger.  When the waitress returned to ask how it was, my mom who rarely complains commented "If the substitutions wouldn't have worked with this order, I would have just liked to know so I could have ordered something else". The waitress said it was her fault; she had put the veggie burger in the computer but "forgot the rye" and thought my mom had said "lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo" when she had said NO mayo. She did apologize. Maybe the veggie burger should be on the regular menu with the "basic" burger? Still, we will come back and enjoy, but it is something to be aware of if there are any allergies/big dislikes as you might be limited on the burger specials.
Great burgers and wings! The shoestring fries, like the burgers, come in generous portions. Don't be put off by the run down exterior....while the place does not look great, the food is very good and the people are nice. While it is a bar, we were able to get a chicken tender appetizer as a meal with homemade chocolate milk for one of the kids. And everything is reasonably priced. It's a good place to watch a game while enjoying a great burger and a beer.
As others have noted from the outside this looks like a dump. One would have to ask what makes this more of a dump than Jamestown in general? In a nutshell this is a solid neighborhood bar serving world class burgers and wings. As for the whiners complaining about service?  Don't let that stop you from coming here. What do you want from a neighborhood bar?  If you want five star service move to NYC. For the record, the waitstaff were working their asses off. Phin and Matts on tap with a Jameson shot. Guy Fieri burger with hand cut fries. Fuggetaboutit !
Some of the best wings I have ever had in my life! The deals on wing night and burger night. Sauce selection is out of this world, as is the selection of burgers. It is dark and set up like a bar but has the menu of a restaurant. They don't always have a lot of staff to go around but the food is well worth any (small) wait you may have to endure.

This is a literal diamond in the rough.....surrounded by the city of Jamestown, this quaint little Irish pub is coupled with sports bar and a blue collar feel that suits everyone.  Come for the game, have a drink from bar and enjoy some of the best food in the area.  Seriously, this establishment has some of the BEST food around hands down.  The burger selections are a riot to read off the menu and even better to eat!  The wings are amazing, and better yet, everything is affordable and reasonably priced.  This is the place for pizza to wings...from burgers to appetizers..they have it all! Miley's Old Inn is clean, laid back and friendly to visitors, I want to give it a full 5 stars...but I cannot do that in good conscience because of the service.  I wanted to be fair and give the good first but ladies and gentlemen, I have to say that despite the best food around, this could possibly be the slowest service around.  Even when its dead, the kitchen takes FOREVER....and after eating, your bill takes even longer.  Don't even consider going there on a lunch break or you will leave hungry.... Bring a book, or call ahead...All in all, this place is a home run...if you have nothing going on for the evening....I HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone!!

I ordered the Lucille Ball burger and it was delicious.  Good service.

Worst service I have ever had.... Our waitress spent more time in the kitchen chatting than taking care of customers typical bar food just another place for beer and wings

As good as it gets in Jamestown for a multi-atmosphere establishment.  Sports bar, Irish pub, family friendly restaurant, American cuisine; plus local catering.  Positively the best chicken wings in town (Medium Cajun Parmesan - extra wet), fantastic specialty burgers (also best in town) and a continually growing menu with some of the most delicious dinner specialties around.  Catch your favorite sporting event on any of their 14 HD TV's and enjoy the latest micro-brews from locally operated Southern Tier Brewery.  A must stop when visiting the area.
